28,WeWork Co-founder Neumann to step down as CEO amid investors' pressure,"US-based shared workspaces startup WeWork's Co-founder Adam Neumann is stepping down from the CEO role and will become a non-executive Chairman, a WeWork spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. WeWork Vice-Chairman Sebastian Gunningham and CFO Artie Minson will become co-CEOs, it added. WeWork's largest investor SoftBank's CEO Masayoshi Son led the charge to remove Neumann, CNBC reported.",TechCrunch,"WeWork�s co-founder and chief executive officer Adam Neumann  has stepped down as CEO and will serve as non-executive chairman of the board, the company confirmed in a press release Tuesday following a report from The Wall Street Journal. WeWork�s vice chairman Sebastian Gunningham and the company�s president and chief operating officer Artie Minson will serve as co-CEOs.The eclectic executive has faced increasing pressure to relinquish his throne after another report from the WSJ highlighted his drug use and desires to become Israel�s prime minister, among other strange behaviors.�As co-founder of WeWork, I am so proud of this team and the incredible company that we have built over the last decade,� Neumann said in a statement. �Our global platform now spans 111 cities in 29 countries, serving more than 527,000 members each day. While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive. Thank you to my colleagues, our members, our landlord partners, and our investors for continuing to believe in this great business.�Neumann�s wife and WeWork co-founder Rebekah Neumann is said to have stepped down from her role as well. Rebekah has had several titles over the years, including chief impact officer, chief brand officer and most recently, co-founder and CEO of WeGrow, WeWork�s �conscious entrepreneurial school.�SoftBank, the Japanese investor that has funneled billions into the star co-working business, is said to have encouraged � rather, enforced � Neumann�s reported transition out of the CEO role ahead of the company�s anticipated initial public offering. Per the WSJ, moving to the chairman seat would �allow [Neumann] to stay at the company he built into one of the country�s most valuable startups, but inject fresh leadership to pursue an IPO that would bring We the cash it needs to keep up its torrid growth.�WeWork revealed its unusual IPO prospectus last month after raising more than $8 billion in equity and debt funding. The New York-based company had been valued at a whopping $47 billion, thanks largely to SoftBank�s repeated investments despite financials that show losses of nearly $1 billion in the six months ending June 30.Wall Street investors were skeptical of the eye-popping valuation, leading to reports WeWork would seek a valuation of as low as $15 billion instead, a magnificent defeat for one of the most valuable private companies in the world. Ultimately, WeWork delayed its float altogether, claiming it planned to go public �by the end of the year.�In additional efforts to appease Wall Street, WeWork amended its S-1 filing to include the appointment of an independent lead director and its first female board member, Frances Frei. On top of that, the company decreased the strength of Class B and Class C shares so Neumann would not have 20 times the voting power of other shareholders, and removed Neumann�s wife from succession planning at the company.According to the latest news, Neumann�s voting shares will be reduced from 10:1 to 3:1.Meanwhile, WeWork is working with bankers to reduce the cost of its money-losing operation, with a new report from The Information stating the business may cut as many as 5,000 roles, or one-third of its entire workforce.The WeWork IPO saga draws many parallels to Uber�s pre-IPO struggles. Both companies were led, for years, by outspoken executives, Neumann and Travis Kalanick, respectively. Both men were ousted, in essence, by frustrated board members who were concerned at the potential outcome of multi-billion-dollar IPOs.Given WeWork�s struggle to complete a public listing and Uber�s disappointing performance on the public markets, perhaps private market investors will realize Silicon Valley�s pixie dust doesn�t carry the same weight on Wall Street.As Adam Neumann reportedly faces pressure to step down; it�s looking like a fight for life between WeWork and SoftBank",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/report-weworks-adam-neumann-to-step-down-as-ceo/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In the video, Dhoni's friend can be seen getting bowled after which he says he wasn't ready and gets out on the next ball.",CricTracker,"MS Dhoni has been a legendary cricketer for the Indian cricket after he made his debut at the highest level in 2004 versus Bangladesh. Around three years later, he took the mantle of leadership in the 2007 T20 World Cup and guided the team to glory, defying all the odds. Later that year, he was made the ODI captain in the tri-nation series in Australia that the Men in Blue won.It was the same year when India crashed out of the World Cup in the West Indies after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the first round. A year later, the keeper became the Test skipper as well and ever since, Indian cricket has seen an upsurge. 12 years since his foray into international cricket, the Jharkhand-born is one of the greatest cricketers India have ever produced.AdvertisementWhen he came into the scheme of things, India also got an answer to their problem of finding a genuine all-format keeper-batsman. Parking aside his prowess on the field, Dhoni isn�t an active participant on social media platforms, but keeps on chipping in with posts from time to time.Recently, he posted a video where he went down the memory lane to his school days. In the video, his friend got bowled while trying to play a shot. Then the batsman hilariously claimed that it was a trial ball. Dhoni said that the childhood funda was a common phenomenon.He captioned the video and wrote, �Wen U know what�s coming and start the camera and u get it in the nxt 1min, sorry for the bad light but it�s the lingo that�s fun trial ball, umpires decision last decision.brings back memory from school days.he wd have never accepted this ever happened if v didn�t have this video.all of us have witnessed this at some point of time in cricket.enjoy.�Dhoni is going through a rather tough time in his career.

Facebook's global policy and communication head Nick Clegg said the idea behind the move is for users to ""judge what politicians say themselves"". However, Facebook will delete content that could lead to real-world violence.",TechCrunch,"Facebook  confirms it won�t fact check politicians� speech or block their content if it�s newsworthy even if it violates the site�s hate-speech rules or other policies. This cementing of its policy comes from Facebook�s head of global policy and communication Nick Clegg, who gave a speech today about Facebook�s plans to prevent interference in the 2020 presidential election.But by seeking neutrality, Facebook may become complicit in the misinformation and malevolence some politicians will use it to spread. It leaves users to fend for themselves as they try to discern fact from fiction and opinion from reality. Clegg claims the idea is for users to �judge what politicians say themselves.�Isn�t that disgorgement of responsibility already what Facebook was doing by merely routing false news links to fact checkers and affixing their verdicts to shares of the content while still leaving it up on the site? To now say politicians can�t be fact-checked directly at all sets a critical and questionable precedent.Facebook�s head of global policy and communications, Nick CleggFacebook�s head of global policy and communications, Nick Clegg�We don�t believe, however, that it�s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician�s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,� writes Clegg, the former deputy Prime Minister of the U.K. �That�s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program . . .This means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review.�Yes, it prevents direct censorship of politicians and leaves critique to the media. Yet it also ignores how Facebook turns any voice into a publication, amplified by engagement-seeking algorithms distributed to billions of people. Users often treat Facebook as the internet and what they see on the internet as true.Facebook doesn�t want false news distorting voters� decisions ahead of the 2020 elections. However, the year-old �no fact-checks� rule and three-year-old �protected newsworthy speech� rule effectively elevate whatever comes out of a politicians mouth as above consequence.If they share a debunked link, that can be labeled as wrong and demoted, but what they say is free to proliferate and confuse people. Not even a politician�s ads are subject to fact check, so you can spread whatever lies you want on Facebook as long as you�re rich enough and running for office. Facebook only draws the line at allowing content from politicians that would cause real-world harm, or running politicians� ads that violate its policies.This is certainly easier operationally for Facebook. It doesn�t have to be responsible for paying in-house staff or outside fact checkers to assess politicians� diatribes. And it won�t as often end up in the cross-hairs of elected officials claiming Facebook is biased against them.Some could see the benefit of these rules being that Facebook could never directly censor a politician unless they directly threatened people. If speaking for themselves from their own accounts, they get what�s close to free speech.But it ignores how politics has evolved in the post-truth era. Rather than win with facts, it�s easier just to shout lies or insults loud and frequently enough that they�re accepted at face value, rebroadcast and culturally ingrained. Sensationalism spreads further than what�s level-headed. The fact check never gets as many shares as the incendiary claim. And those with a bully pulpit can keep an iron grip on their megaphone.Facebook may not want to be the arbiter of truth, or even be considered �media,� but it transmits falsity without question; it�s not a platform, it�s a pawn.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/pawn-not-platform/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

51,"Trump criticises China, says it has broken promises on trade","Addressing the UN General Assembly, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticised China and its trade practices. He accused it of not adopting ""promised reforms"". Trump added, ""China has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft...on a grand scale.""",Reuters,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a stinging rebuke to China�s trade practices on Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not accept a �bad deal� in U.S.-China trade negotiations. Four days after deputy U.S. and Chinese negotiators held inconclusive talks in Washington, Trump�s remarks were anything but conciliatory and emphasized the need to correct structural economic abuses at the heart of the countries� nearly 15-month trade war. He said Beijing had failed to keep promises it made when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and was engaging in predatory practices that had cost millions of jobs in the United States and other countries. �Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,� Trump said. �As far as America is concerned, those days are over.� Although Trump held out hope that the United States and China could still reach a trade deal, he made clear he wanted a deal that would rebalance the relationship between the two economic superpowers. �The American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance in our relationship with China. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial for both countries,� Trump said. �As I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal.� Trump also recently said he was not interested in a �partial deal� to ease tensions with China, saying that he would hold out for a �complete deal.� U.S. stocks gave up modest gains and fell into negative territory after Trump�s U.N. address, which some investors said marked a reversal of the more constructive tone that had surrounded the negotiations last week. [.N] �Trump�s comments to the U.N. were very antagonistic toward China. In the last couple of weeks there�s been optimism trade would go in a positive direction,� said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, an investment advisory group based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  �It was the tone and the fact he listed out in great detail all the gripes the U.S. has with China,� Zaccarelli said. �All that trade optimism that�s been building has been sucked out of the air and replaced with pessimism.� Trump�s speech highlighted the plight of U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O), which has become a symbol of U.S. assertions that China fails to protect American intellectual property and steals it or forces the transfer of it. Two years ago Micron accused a Chinese state firm of stealing its chip designs. �Soon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China,� Trump said, �But we are seeking justice.� He added that the United States lost 60,000 factories and 4.2 million manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. �The rhetoric around China and President Trump�s speech was as harsh as we have heard,� said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at brokerage National Securities Corp in New York. China�s top official at the U.N. General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, sat silently during Trump�s remarks, showing no reaction on camera. Wang is due to speak on U.S.-China relations on Tuesday evening at a business event in New York. The tone of Trump�s speech also was at odds with some recent steps by China to meet his request for purchases of more American farm products. On Monday, Chinese importers bought about 10 shiploads of U.S. soybeans - about 600,000 tonnes. China�s customs commission will exclude certain amounts of U.S. soybeans, pork and other products from its retaliatory tariffs, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday. The purchases were made following last week�s trade talks, which both the U.S. and Chinese sides characterized as �productive.� People familiar with the trade talks said no new Chinese proposals were presented, and the countries agreed to continue minister-level talks in early October. In his U.N. speech, Trump also drew a link between resolving the U.S.-China trade dispute and Beijing�s treatment of Hong Kong. Washington was �carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong,� he said.�The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong�s freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life,� Trump said. Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997. �How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader,� Trump added. Trump also touched on trade with Japan in his speech, saying that he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday would �continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal.� It remains unclear whether the two countries will sign the deal at their bilateral meeting or whether Japanese requests for assurances that Trump won�t hit them with autos tariffs will delay the final agreement.

What lies ahead for him is to become the world�s largest hotel chain by continuing to stay innovative. �While one is in the process of coming up with a truly innovative solution, it is essential to keep an open mind,� Agarwal said in a tete-a-tete with Sandeep Soni. Below are the edited excerpts � part 2.While India and China remain your biggest markets but how do you see the graph moving ahead particularly with respect to your US foray?You are right. India and China are two of our biggest and home markets. In fact, China is bigger than India for us in terms of room count. We have over 500,000 rooms in China and more than 270,000 rooms in India. In addition to these two markets, the US is our third home market and it is the fastest scale-up for us in any market globally, with over 100 hotels in a short span of time. The US has the potential to be a large market in the future. Indonesia had a stagnant growth but has taken off in a big way. We have over 21,000 keys in Indonesia. I think as we go forward, China, India, the US and Indonesia will continue to be our biggest markets. The focus in Europe continues to be on vacation homes while we are catering to the growing demand for quality, affordable accommodations in the Middle East.Talking of innovation, when you say you will be the world�s largest hotel company, how does the innovation look to you from the top?While one is in the process of coming up with a truly innovative solution, it is essential to keep an open mind. One should accept failure, and be willing to learn, unlearn and relearn again. We have always believed that an overnight success story is backed by at least five years of dedicated hard work and perseverance.

59,Delhi to be 1st state to give legal protection to vendors: Kejriwal,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the national capital will soon become the ""first state"" to implement the Street Vending Act, 2014, to provide legal protection to street vendors and hawkers. ""Because vendors don't have legal status, whatever they do is termed illegal. That's why they are harassed by every department...People extort money from them,"" Kejriwal said.",Times Now,"New Delhi: Claiming to be the first city to implement the Street Vendors Act, 2014, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced that the city government will legalise the street vendors and hawkers and will provide them protection in the national capital.""Delhi will become the first state to implement the Act. Under it, 28 town vending committees have been set up and a notification has been issued. The election for the committees too has been done,"" Kejriwal said.The committees, each having 30 members, have 12 vendors or hawkers as their team, while rest of the members are officials, town planners, police and traffic police, and RWAs and market association, and officials from the health department he said.Kejriwal said the MCDs and the civic bodies have been asked to conduct a survey of vendors through their respective town vending committees. After the survey is completed, street vendors will be given certificates and thereafter, licences will be issued.""The licences will have the name of the owner, address and the place of vending, and this will ensure that they are not harassed by anyone,"" Kejriwal said. He said earlier street vendors were harassed and forcibly removed by police and civic bodies. ""Now licences will be provided to the vendors based and it will end their extortion and harassment"". He added that the Street Vending Act will not only benefit hawkers but will also help in decongesting the roads in the city.The Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 was passed in February, 2014 to regulate street vendors in public areas and protect their rights. It was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2012 by then Union Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Kumari Selja.Kejriwal said as part of the procedure, the MCDs will have a survey to identify the vendors and hawkers in the area and ""those who were removed from any part of the city due to any rule will also be given space."" The Chief Minister said the town vending committees will take the decision on the final number of vendors at any location.""The committee will have all the power. It will identify vending and non-vending zones. The members will decide where the hawkers will be allowed. The government will not have any role,"" he said. Kejriwal said the vendors play an important role in society in any city. ""And it will not be wrong to say they are the lifeline of Delhi.""He said developed nations have a legal way of organising these vendors. ""In Delhi, they play an important role in the lifeline and economy. We buy vegetables, milk, fruits and other daily use things. But we don't have any policy to organise them. This results in so many issues.""Speaking about the issues faced by the vendors, he said the police, MCD and other local bodies harass them and extort money from them. ""Different bodies have the anti-encroachment drive and the vendors have to bear the loss as their products were taken into the custody.""""After the law is implemented, they will not be harassed. We are also exploring if we can provide them with any structure as per international standards with garbage bins and solar panels for electricity. This will also uniform the markets and make them beautiful as well. They will also not hamper the traffic if their locations are fixed. ""He said although there is no estimate of the number but close to five lakh vendors are in the city. ""We are expecting the survey to start in next 10-15 days and each committee will have to deal with about three assembly constituencies. We hope that in about one-two months, the survey will be completed. The weekly markets will also be counted in this,"" he said.Kejriwal said the first choice will be that the vendors should be given the same spot where they are working, ""but the final decision will be of the committee"".On being asked if this was being done just months before the Assembly polls to attract the hawkers and vendors, who were a key vote bank of the Aam Aaami Party, he said: ""We started the work on this soon after coming to power (in 2015), but someone filed a case and the court has disapproved it. Now, in a way, we also have the court's approval.""The tenure of the Kejriwal government will end in February 2020. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had directed the civic bodies here to ensure pavements are cleared from all encroachments and Kejriwal said his government is working on solutions to save the livelihood of street vendors.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/delhi-to-implement-street-vendors-act-says-chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal/494487?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

67,"Fundbox raises $176 million from General Catalyst, others",US-based fintech startup Fundbox has raised $176 million equity financing in a Series C funding round from investors including Allianz SE and General Catalyst. Its total funding to date is around $433.5 million. The new round reportedly valued Fundbox at between $500 million and $1 billion. It plans to ultimately transform B2B payments by creating a Visa-like payments network.,TechCrunch,"Credit cards have become all but ubiquitous for consumer transactions, and it isn�t hard to see why. By intermediating payments, networks like Visa allow buyers and sellers to exchange money for goods and services without knowing the financial risk profile of the counter-party. Rather than applying for credit at every merchant you shop at, you apply once at your issuing institution, and then can transact with every merchant on the network. It�s the simple formula: reducing friction means more sales, and therefore more profits.Yet for all the innovation in the consumer side of the economy, there has been an astonishingly limited amount of innovation in the B2B world. Payments between businesses are still conducted through invoices, with net payment terms that can exceed 90 days and with little knowledge of the financial risk of the counter-parties. There is no FICO score for business as there is with consumers, nor is there a system that can intermediate those transactions and reduce their friction.That�s where Fundbox comes in. The SF-headquartered startup wants to ultimately transform B2B payments by creating a Visa-like payments network that allows businesses to transact with each other without having to know counter-party risk while also getting everyone paid faster.It�s a vision that has pulled in the attention of even more venture capital. The company, which was founded in 2013, announced today that it has raised $176 million in a series C equity financing led by a consortium of funders, including Allianz X,  Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, HarbourVest and a litany of others. Existing backers Khosla, General Catalyst, and Spark Capital Growth also participated. With this new round of capital, the company�s total equity funding reaches upwards of $300 million.Embedded finance, or why fintech mega VC rounds have become so commonIn addition to the equity capital, the company also announced that it has raised a $150 million credit facility to underwrite its product.Fundbox  CEO Eyal Shinar said that a priority in this fundraise was to select backers who not only could invest in equity, but also had large balance sheets who could expand the company�s underwriting capability as it scales.Today, Fundbox�s core product is a revolving line of credit for small businesses. Cash flow is a huge concern for many companies, since they often have to wait for a payment from an invoice to arrive before investing in their next projects or hiring more employees. A revolving line of credit allows companies to flexibly draw down and pay back a loan, while only paying fees on what a company uses.To apply for the loan, companies connect Fundbox to their financial data store (for example, QuickBooks), and Fundbox slurps in the data and offers a credit decision in as fast as minutes. Companies can then tap their line of credit almost immediately and use it as working capital. As invoices are paid, companies can then pay off their line of credit and stop paying fees.From that product base, Shinar ultimately sees Fundbox as a GDP-scale startup, given the value it could potentially unlock for companies and the economy at large. �There are more than $3 trillion locked in those invoices,� he explained to me, �$3.4 trillion flows through consumer credit cards, but $23 trillion are in invoices � and even if you focus on [just] small and medium business, it�s $9 trillion.�As the company collects data from all the players in the market, it wants to build upon those data network effects to ultimately operate the payment rails for B2B transactions. So instead of offering a line of credit to the seller, it could facilitate both sides of the transaction and get rid of the root complexity in the first place.It�s a bold vision, and certainly one that has attracted a variety of players. In the startup world, Kabbage (whose co-founder and president Kathryn Petralia I will be interviewing at TechCrunch Disrupt SF next week) has built a business around line of credit lending and has similarly raised large amounts of venture capital.Larger companies like Square,  PayPay, and Intuit (which owns the popular accounting software QuickBooks) have introduced various lending products to B2B customers. And in terms of payments, Stripe through its new credit card and Brex offer the means for companies to empower their employees to make purchases on behalf of the company.Shinar said that a huge priority for Fundbox has been to make underwriting more efficient. He said that a large percentage of the current employee base at the company is data scientists, and the company has built upon the wave of digitalization that has taken place among small and medium businesses. �Every company has at least one set of APIs � and it is accessible, and it is granular,� Shinar said. By just tapping into those existing data feeds, Fundbox is able to avoid the human underwriting common with much of business lending today.One initiative the company has undertaken is a tool dubbed �X-Ray� to better describe how the company�s machine learning models are really underwriting its loan products. Shinar noted that payments is a highly-regulated space, and that the company has to be able to explain its decisions and how they are unbiased to any regulator that might start asking questions.The company today has 240 employees spread across SF, Tel Aviv, and a recently launched office in Dallas. Shinar says that he wants to use the new funds to �go on the offensive� and �double and triple down on what is working.�",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/fundbox-raises-176-million-series-c-to-build-visa-for-b2b-payments/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Under the WTO Information Technology Agreement, also signed by India, solar photovoltaic cells are exempt from basic customs duty. Singh, however, favoured nil duty on imported raw materials for manufacturing solar panels.",BloombergQuint,"Union Power Minister RK Singh has urged the finance ministry to impose basic customs duty on solar equipment in a phased manner to boost domestic manufacturing.Singh wrote a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking imposition of basic customs duty on imported solar cells and panels. BloombergQuint has reviewed a copy of the letter.India is a signatory to the World Trade Organisation�s Information Technology Agreement signed in 1996 and solar photovoltaic cells and modules are classified under Customs Tariff Head 8541 and exempt from basic customs duty. The power minister, in his letter, sought a separate classification for solar panels.This comes over three months after domestic solar equipment makers requested for a safeguard duty on solar cell imports from countries like Thailand and Vietnam.To protect local producers, the government had imposed a 25 percent tariff on imports of Chinese and Malaysian solar cells and modules for the first year starting July 30, 2018, and 20 percent and 15 percent for the two subsequent six-month periods, respectively. The safeguard duty will expire in July 2020.Still India�s solar equipment imports have not come down despite the safeguard duty. �For the first seven months of 2019, 77 percent of the solar cells and modules imported into India have come from China,� Rohit Gadre, analyst at BloombergNEF, told BloombergQuint in an e-mailed response.Basic Customs Duty Proposed By Power MinisterSingh, however, said there should be no duty on wafers, silver paste, glass, aluminum frames, and other raw materials used for manufacturing of solar cells and panels till Dec. 31, 2023.Singh said solar PV cells and modules under Customs Tariff Head 8541 should be separated into two custom tariff heads�solar PV cells and solar PV panels. �This will help to provide differential import duties and differential duty trajectory for both solar cells and panels.�The proposal, if implemented, will increase total project cost of solar power developers by almost 20 percent which will further increase tariff to Rs 2.9 per unit, Shashi Shekhar, vice chairman at Acme Solar, told BloombergQuint over the phone, adding that distribution companies won�t buy at higher tariffs.�This is not the way to increase domestic manufacturing capacity,� he said. �The way to make domestic manufacturing competitive is increasing domestic production of glass manufacturing, wafers, raw materials used for solar cells and panels. This should be done with technology upgradation.�According to Indian Solar Manufacturers Association, the current installed capacity is 9 gigawatt for solar modules and 3.3 GW for solar cells.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/power-minister-bats-for-basic-customs-duty-on-imported-solar-panels?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

CNBC reported today that the earbuds, deemed ""Puget"", will come with a built-in accelerometer that can track your run, the calories you've burned and your pace. We heard rumblings that Amazon is working on a competitor to Apple's Airpods earlier this year, but this is the first indication that it will also work as a health device.It's unknown when exactly we'll catch a glimpse of these earbuds. Amazon is expected to unveil a host of new devices at its big hardware event on September 25th. As is typical, the company has remained silent on what exactly we can expect from the event. If last year is any guide, there will likely be some surprises in store. CNBC also reported that the company is working on an Echo device with better sound quality for music -- a rumor that we've heard before -- so we may see that item debut at the event as well.Fitness tracking capabilities and a lower price could certainly give the new Alexa earbuds an edge over Apple's Airpods. AirPods are currently the best-selling wireless earpods in the world, making up 60 percent of the global market.

Also joining the initiative will be Amazon, Whatsapp and Linkedin.Group members today met with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss how social media giants are complying with the Christchurch Call to Action. The pledge -- written after a mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand that killed 51 people was broadcast on Facebook Live -- called on technology companies to help advert such incidents. Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Google and Microsoft back in May joined the pledge.The independent GIFCT said they would be committed to carrying out the Christchurch Call's nine-point plan, which included better protocols for users to report harmful content, collaborating on technology, instilling checks on livestreaming to avoid spreading extremist material and more. Facebook unveiled a ""one-strike"" policy for its Facebook Live feature shortly after the Christchurch mass shooting but has yet to deploy any additional safeguards.Most recently, the group contributed to a shared database of ""hashes"" or digital fingerprints of known terrorist images and video propaganda. Since terrorists often upload the same piece of content on multiple social media platforms, it's oftentimes useful for platforms to be on the lookout for such material before it spreads. The size of the database has grown in a period of two years to include more than 200,000 individual ""hashes"".The group's new independence comes as governments around the world look for ways to take big tech companies to task for violent content. The Australian government earlier this year passed new laws that would penalize technology companies for allowing the streaming of videos containing serious offenses.

AUSTRAC also ordered investigations into Paypal over ongoing concerns that it is being used by child exploitation rings in Asia. It directed the auditor to look at the fund transfers and record-keeping, and report back within 120 days.",Reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia�s financial intelligence agency on Tuesday ordered an audit of PayPal Holdings Inc�s compliance with local anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, saying it was concerned reporting obligations had not been met. AUSTRAC, which is tasked with ensuring compliance with the  laws, ordered PayPal�s Australian unit to appoint an external auditor to look at the fund transfers at its own cost and report back within 120 days. AUSTRAC said in a statement that International Funds Transfer Instructions reported by the financial sector provided intelligence that enabled the agency and its partners to combat serious crimes, such as child sex exploitation. �Regulated businesses like PayPal Australia, who facilitate payments and transactions for millions of Australian customers every year, play a critical role in helping AUSTRAC and our law enforcement partners stop the movement of money to criminals and terrorists,� AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose said in a statement. PayPal said its Australian unit reported itself to authorities after an internal review found an issue with the way it reported international fund transfers to AUSTRAC. It said suggestions the reason for the audit was the discovery of child sex exploitation connections were not correct. �We are working in full cooperation with AUSTRAC to remediate this reporting system issue and to undertake the audit as outlined by AUSTRAC in the time specified,� PayPal�s senior communications director, Amanda Christine Miller, said in an email.  The audit would have no impact on customers, Miller added. U.S.-based PayPal operates a worldwide online payment service which connects buyers and sellers through a secure online wallet linked to both parties� bank accounts. A preliminary report from a separate review ordered by AUSTRAC into buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay Touch Group in June, citing suspected non-compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, was due to be handed to AUSTRAC on Tuesday. Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) players let shoppers purchase products without paying upfront, and without the regulatory hurdle of applying for a credit card or loan, raising concerns about shopper identity. AUSTRAC and Afterpay did not immediately respond to questions about that review. Australian regulators are under sustained pressure to act after the Royal Commission inquiry into financial sector misconduct widely condemned their performance in recent years. The Royal Commission found that when misconduct by financial institutions was revealed, it either went unpunished or the regulatory consequences did not reflect the seriousness of what had been done.

103,Honda to stop sale of diesel cars in Europe by 2021,"Honda Motor said on Monday it will stop selling diesel vehicles in Europe by 2021 in favour of models with electric propulsion systems. The move comes as the Japanese automaker moves to electrify all of its European cars by 2025 and follow emissions regulations. In February, Honda said it would shut its only British plant, leading to 3,500 job cuts.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) said on Monday it would phase out all diesel cars by 2021 in favour of models with electric propulsion systems, as the Japanese automaker moves to electrify all of its European cars by 2025. By next year, according to European Union emission targets, CO2 must be cut to 95 gram per km for 95% of cars from the current 120.5 gram average, a figure that has increased of late as consumers spurn fuel-efficient diesels and embrace SUVs. All new cars in the EU must be compliant in 2021.     For Honda, declining demand for diesel vehicles and tougher emissions regulations have clouded its manufacturing prospects in Europe. Honda said in February it would close its only British car plant in 2021 with the loss of up to 3,500 jobs. Japan�s No. 3 automaker has said it would cut the number of car model variations to a third of current offerings by 2025, reducing global production costs by 10% and redirecting those savings towards advanced research and development.

106,"Volkswagen CEO, Chairman charged with market manipulation in Germany","German prosecutors on Tuesday brought criminal charges of stock market manipulation against Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, Chairman Hans Dieter Pötsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn in relation to an emissions cheating scandal. They intentionally failed to inform investors in time about financial impact of the scandal, the prosecutors' office said. Diess will continue as CEO despite the charges.",Reuters,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors have accused Volkswagen�s CEO of holding back market-moving information on rigged emissions tests four years ago, raising the prospect of fresh upheaval at the carmaker just as it tries to reinvent itself as a champion of clean driving.  Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig said on Tuesday they would press criminal charges of stock market manipulation against Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, as well as non-executive Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn. The charges show how the German company, which in September 2015 admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests, is struggling to move on from a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion (24 billion pounds) in vehicle refits, fines and provisions.  Court proceedings are under way over that admission. The indictment from the prosecutors in Braunschweig - in Volkswagen�s (VOWG_p.DE) home region of Lower Saxony - is part of a separate legal push to try managers over an alleged delay in informing investors of the company�s wrongdoing.  Lawyers for the three accused said they would contest the charges that they knowingly held back vital information. Volkswagen said its full supervisory board would convene on Wednesday to discuss the indictments. In a statement issued after an emergency meeting, the board�s executive committee said it �cannot see that there was any deliberate attempt not to inform the capital market�. If accepted by a Braunschweig state court, the indictment would lead to a trial date being set. The former U.S. regulator who helped bring Volkswagen�s  cheating to light dismissed the company�s arguments. �The excuse that top managers knew nothing is very weak,� Alberto Ayala, who served at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) until 2017, told German news magazine Spiegel. Separately on Tuesday, German prosecutors hit rival carmaker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) with an 870 million euro fine for breaking diesel emissions rules. The Stuttgart-based maker of Mercedes-Benz cars said it would not appeal. Volkswagen this year bucked a trend of falling demand for passenger cars by launching a range of popular sport utility vehicles, and is investing billions to try to become a leader in electric and self-driving technologies. Its shares were down 2% at 153.42 euros in afternoon trade. Diess�s lawyer said the indictment would not hinder him in his role as CEO, adding that as Diess did not join Volkswagen until July 2015 he could not have foreseen the scandal would have such a huge impact on the company.  Volkswagen shares lost up to 37% in value in the days after the scandal broke. Had investors known about the emissions test cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, plaintiffs have argued. Volkswagen and its executives have said the fallout from the scandal was not foreseeable, and that they had expected to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities prior to the disclosure of the test cheating.  Braunschweig prosecutors said the accused should have kept investors informed. �They pursued a strategy to achieve a settlement with the U.S. authorities without disclosing all relevant information,� they said in a statement.  Winterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke, having been CEO for eight years. He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than Volkswagen had officially admitted.  Poetsch became a management board member at Volkswagen in 2003 and was made chairman in 2015.  The 636-page indictment alleges Winterkorn was fully aware of the matter and potential financial damage to Volkswagen as of March 2015. Poetsch was allegedly informed on June 29 and Diess on July 27. Investigations into the alleged perpetrators of the illegal engine control software, also known as defeat devices, have seen the arrest of the then CEO of Volkswagen�s Audi (NSUG.DE) unit, Rupert Stadler.     In July 2019, Stadler - whose contract was later terminated by Volkswagen - and three defendants were charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices.     Investigations into a further 23 suspects continue, the Munich prosecutor said at the time. Braunschweig prosecutors in April charged Winterkorn and four other managers with fraud over their role in the manipulation of emissions testing.

127,"Hyundai, Aptiv to set up $4 billion self-driving car venture","South Korean carmaker Hyundai is setting up a joint venture with Dublin-based global auto parts company Aptiv to develop self-driving vehicle technologies. Hyundai Motor Group affiliates will collectively invest $2 billion in the venture, valuing it at $4 billion. Aptiv, which will own 50% of the joint venture, will contribute its autonomous driving technology, IP and about 700 employees.",Reuters,"SEOUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group will invest $1.6 billion in a joint venture to develop self-driving vehicle technologies with Aptiv (APTV.N), the biggest overseas investment by the South Korean carmaker to catch up to rivals in the autonomous car market.  Global carmakers and their suppliers are forging alliances to develop autonomous car technologies partly due to the need to share the huge financial and technical burdens. Hyundai has lagged global rivals who have invested heavily into developing new technologies for electrified and autonomous vehicles.  Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), Kia Motors (000270.KS) and Hyundai Mobis (012330.KS) will collectively contribute $1.6 billion in cash and $400 million in research and development resources and others, valuing the joint venture $4 billion, Hyundai Group and Aptiv said in a joint statement.      Dublin-headquarterd Aptiv, which will own 50% of the joint venture, will contribute its autonomous driving technology, intellectual property, and about 700 employees focused on the development of scalable autonomous driving solutions.  Aptiv Chief Executive Kevin Clark in a joint interview with Hyundai Executive Vice Chairman and heir apparent Euisun Chung on Monday the joint venture at this point would not get involved in running ride-hailing, data or network services of its own. Instead, the new firm would begin testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and have a production-ready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers, fleet operators and automakers in 2022.  �Uber is developing its own technology, but potentially our technology could be better than theirs and then they could also become our customers,� Chung said through a translator. Hyundai Motor aims to commercialise its own autonomous vehicles in 2024. Clark said the alliance would initially focus on self-driving technology for passenger vehicles. But Chung said the Aptiv partnership ultimately also could help Hyundai speed up automation for commercial vehicles, such as long-haul trucks. The executives said their technology would be tested and developed across Asia, Europe and the United States to offer products tailored to major markets. They said they would discuss additional alliance members going forward. The new joint venture will be based in Boston, with technology centers across the United States and Asia.  U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking before a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said the deal would reinforce the alliance between Washington and Seoul. Aptiv, which manufactures vehicle components and provides technology for self-driving cars, was formerly known as Delphi Automotive, which was split into Aptiv and Delphi Technologies (DLPH.N) in 2017. Deutsche Bank said in a report that Hyundai�s cash injection would enable Aptiv to cut its near-term funding needs. But Deutsche questioned whether the new structure could deter other automakers from sourcing autonomous systems from Aptiv in the future. Aptiv�s major customers include GM, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Fiat, according to its annual report. Hyundai Motor is also one of its customers, a Hyundai spokesman said.      Market research firm Navigant Research put Aptiv at No.4 among automated driving system companies, following Waymo, General Motors (GM.N) and Ford (F.N). Hyundai was not among the top 10 vendors. The latest investment is another sign that Hyundai has abandoned its strategy of developing technology in-house, a strategy which previously raised investor concerns that it may be left behind in the race for future mobility.      Hyundai, which along with affiliate Kia Motors ranks fifth in global sales, has joined rivals in making a series of investments in technology firms, including self-driving car tech startup Aurora, especially after Chung was promoted a year ago. Hyundai Motor said in February that it would invest 14.7 trillion won ($12.3 billion) in future technologies such as self-driving, connectivity and car-sharing areas by 2023.  In March, Hyundai Motor and Kia announced a plan to invest $300 million in Indian ride-hailing platform Ola, following the $275 million that the pair invested in Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab last year.  The Aptiv venture will be headquartered in Boston. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.

An official said, ""The instances seem to be numerous and the child seemed to have no count over how many times she was abused."" The police has arrested three men including the girl's father.",The News Minute,"When Childline officials at Malappuram district approached a Class 7 student for counselling following a request from her school, they never imagined that it will unravel a heinous crime. At the counselling session on Saturday, the girl recounted stories of sexual abuse, at the hands of different men, and allegedly with the knowledge of her parents.According to sources in Childline, the 12-year-old girl was being sexually abused and even raped by multiple persons in the last two years. ""The instances seem to be numerous and the child seemed to have no count over how many times she was abused,"" a Childline official told TNM. Medical reports have confirmed that the child was indeed raped.The incident came to light when recently, other parents from the same taluk informed the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of the child�s school that they suspected she was being subjected to something inappropriate at home. �The teachers then began to observe the student. She was absent in the school on most days and mostly kept to herself. As the teachers felt that something was bothering the girl, they informed Childline,� said the source.�She told us that her father's friends did things to her. But we realised the gravity of the situation when we understood that the child was actually pushed into sex trade by her parents. From what we came to know, the parents are not in a good financial condition and they made a living with this,� alleged a source in district Childline to TNM.According to officials of Tirurangadi police, of the multiple persons who have allegedly abused her, she could clearly name only two persons. �We have arrested those two along with the father of the child. We are finding it a bit difficult to proceed with the case as the child does not know the names of any other people who have abused her and the father is staunchly denying all allegations,� said the official.The two arrested other than the girl�s father are 38-year-old Shaiju Karappan and 36-year-old Ashraf Muhammad Kutty.The two have been charged with sections 354 (A) (1) (i) (Physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures), 376 (Rape) of Indian Penal Code and sections 4 (Punishment for penetrative sexual assault), section 6 (Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and section 10 (Punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.�The child is not giving statements to the police as she spoke to the officials of Childline. The only thing she told us was that her mother was unaware of this, while her father knew. But the father has denied the allegation,� the police official stated.The child is at present under the care of Child Protection Committee members and is housed in a rescue home in the district.Also read:Meet Sheeja, Kerala woman who became a toddy tapper to support her familyHow a Kerala student won the fight against restrictions on mobile use in hostel",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/confessions-class-7-girl-kerala-reveal-her-father-pushed-her-sex-trade-109398?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Diagram shows how a normal uterus compares to sufferers of uterus didelphysThe mother carried all the girls in her right womb, while Harvey grew in her left.�Mrs Cotter, from Melbourne, Australia, said: 'From quite early, on Ben and I discussed having children and it was clear that he really wanted to be a dad.'I knew I had to be open and honest and tell him that might not be a possibility for me.'Luckily he wasn't bothered. We talked it through and agreed that there was more than one way to have a baby if you wanted it badly enough.'But actually, we have found it easy to fall pregnant � I am not sure why, or if it has anything to do with my two vaginas.'�After starting her periods aged 14, Mrs Cotter soon began to suffer with painful cramps and heavy bleeding.An ultrasound two years later revealed she had uterus didelphys, which�occurs when the uterus fails to fuse properly during development in the womb.The mother met husband Ben at 17 and the pair married in 2012. Desperate to become parents, the newlyweds started trying for a baby a year after tying the knotTwins Maya and Evie after being born on June 5, 2018, weighing 5lb 13oz and 5lb 4oz respectively.Miracle babies: Mrs Cotter conceived the twins despite being fitted with a contraceptive implant which is said to be 99 per cent effectiveAccording to the World Health Organisation, the condition affects around one in 3,000 women.A few months after her diagnosis, Mrs Cotter had laser surgery to remove the dividing wall between her two vaginas, which enabled�her to enjoy a normal love life.�A year later, when she was 17, she met her police detective husband and the loved-up couple got married in Melbourne in 2012.Desperate to become parents, the newlyweds started trying�for a baby a year after tying the knot.Uterus didelphys, also known as a double uterus, is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus, to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas, though this is not always the case.It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes.As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ � the uterus.Sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ so the woman is born with two wombs.It often only becomes noticeable after puberty and is diagnosed with a physical exam or an ultrasound scan.In terms of physical anatomy, the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit, though they can be as big as a 'normal' womb.It also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb.Some women are also born with two vaginas, although they can have sex and menstruate in the same way as people with just one.'They may know they have two and be able to find them, or they may not realise,' Dr Leila Hanna, a consultant gynaecologist & Obstetrician at BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline.'It can be painful because there are two squashed in the same area, so sometimes we do an operation to join them together, but its not necessary.'They could also have abnormalities of their kidneys and the tube which bring the urine from the bladder.'Women will frequently have a slightly higher risk of late miscarriage, premature delivery and bleeding during pregnancy.Often Caesarean sections are recommended, to reduce the risk of complications.There is no treatment or cure for the condition.But, while fertility itself was not an issue, Mrs Cotter was warned that miscarriages and stillbirths were a possibility given that her wombs were half the average size.The couple, who were braced for a difficult road to parenthood, were shocked when Mrs Cotter became pregnant with Amelie in October 2013 after just a month of trying.Mrs Cotter said: 'We decided to give it a go, and just see what happened. We knew it might be a bumpy road and tried not to get our hopes up too much.'Just a month after we started trying, I bought a stack of pregnancy tests and started taking them weekly.'Then one morning, I had a test to hand, and there on the stick was a very, very, faint blue line.'I couldn't be sure, so I took a test each morning that week, and each day the line got darker and darker until I was sure - we were pregnant.'�The pregnancy went smoothly and baby Amelie was delivered by Caesarean section on June 12, 2014, at Melbourne's Mercy Hospital for Women, weighing a healthy 6lbs 13oz.Settling into family life, the couple decided to start trying for baby number two around 18 months later.After just two months Mrs Cotter became pregnant and was surprised to discover at her first scan that her baby was growing in her left womb, not her right, as before.'I carried Amelie in my right, and just assumed the left one was a dud,' she added.Following another problem-free pregnancy, Harvey was delivered by Caesarean at 33 weeks.Arriving at the Mercy Hospital for Women, he weighed 4lbs 12oz, and, after initially struggling to swallow on his own, was allowed home after three weeks.Already busy raising two young children, Mrs Cotter was unsure if she wanted to try again right away.So a year and a half after having Harvey she was fitted with a contraceptive implant on the advice of her consultant.'The Pill was giving me migraines and I couldn't use the coil, so in the end the implant was the only option left,' she said.�According to the NHS, the implant is more than 99 per cent effective � but just three weeks after having it fitted, Mrs Cotter became pregnant with twins.�'This feeling came over me, and on some level, I knew I was pregnant,' she said.�'The day my period was due, I dug out a pregnancy test, and within minutes my suspicions were confirmed.'�Mrs Cotter, from Melbourne, Australia, caresses her 15-month old twins�Maya and Evie�Ben brings daughter Amelie and son Harvey to meet their new siblings in hospital in June 2018.�Evie (pictured in the incubator) was born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs when a baby is born with their intestines in the chest cavity'Shocked doesn't begin to cover it. During 17 years together, Ben and I had only ever got pregnant when we'd planned it. Now, here we were, having surprise twins.'Concerned about how long Mrs Cotter would be able to carry twins due to her condition, doctors put her on strict bed rest from 19 weeks onward.'My doctor was very honest and said he couldn't know how the pregnancy was going to play out,' she said.By the 37 week mark Maya and Evie were delivered by Caesarean on June 5, 2018, weighing 5lbs 13oz and 5lbs 4oz, respectively.While they initially seemed perfectly healthy, drama struck just hours after their arrival when Evie began struggling with her breathing and was sent to intensive care.An X-ray of her lungs showed she was suffering with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs when a baby is born with their intestines in the chest cavity.At just five days old she had keyhole surgery, which her parents were warned she had just a 50 per cent chance of surviving.�But the youngster made a full recovery and was ready to come home after three weeks.Now 15 months old, the twins are happy, healthy and at the centre of the family's 'crazy, hectic and amazing' life.

Chinese government officials had�previously�warned about �reverse sanctions� on Indian companies doing business in China if the Indian government blocks Huawei�s 5G rollout in the country.�Huawei has been facing several regulatory roadblocks related to issues relating of privacy, and data theft after reports of the company embedding snooping software in the source code of its servers were released.�The steering committee overseeing 5G is looking into Chinese participation in the launch of 5G services in India. The committee had given the go-ahead to Indian telecom operators for their respective 5G trail with an exception for Chinese vendors.�In a meeting held in June earlier this year committee head, K Vijay Raghavan said that the matter is under deliberation regarding �the pros and cons of working with Chinese vendors�.Talking about further Chinese investments in India, Chen had previously stated that several potential Chinese investors are closely looking into the Huawei�s treatment by the Indian government before giving the go-ahead for Indian operations.��Huawei itself has invested about $3.5 billion in India and operates a manufacturing unit in Chennai for production of 2G, 3G and 4G equipment.

New York, New York1:05 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  It�s a great honor to be with my friend, the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  And we have some great discussions going on with Pakistan about a lot of things, including the Taliban and Afghanistan, and many other things.  And trade, I think, maybe is one of the most important.  We�re going to increase trade with Pakistan by a tremendous margin.We do a very small amount of trade with them, and they want to do a large, and so do we.  And we should be able to do that, I think, Wilbur, very easily.  So we�re going to double, triple, quadruple the trade.  It will be very easy to do.  They make great product, and so do we.And I was really shocked when I saw the original numbers from last year and the year before, and for many years, that the trade with Pakistan isn�t much greater.  But it could be many times the number.So we�ll be talking about trade and other things.  And it�s an honor to be with you.  Thank you very much.  Please.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I look forward, Mr. President, to talk to you about, obviously, Afghanistan, which is a big issue for us Pakistanis, because stability in Afghanistan means stability in Pakistan.  We also want to talk about all three neighbors: Afghanistan, India, Kashmir.  And, of course, Iran, it�s just � we will discuss the situation there because all � these all three neighbors of Pakistan.  And I �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He lives in a very friendly neighborhood.  (Laughter.)PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I mean, as if there are not already enough challenges.Q    Mr. President, after your last meeting with the Prime Minister, you offered to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.  And since then, the situation has gotten more complicated, and India continues to deny our access in the region.  So where does the offer stand now on (inaudible)?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It would always stand.  If I can help, I would certainly do that.  And it will be dependent on both of these gentlemen.  One without the other doesn�t work, if you�re going to do mediation or if you�re going to do an arbitration.But certainly, I would be willing to help if both wanted.  If both Pakistan, let�s say, and India wanted me to do that, I am ready, willing, and able.  It�s a complex issue.  It�s been going on for a long time.  But if both wanted it, I would be ready to do it.Q    Mr. President, with all the things � reverting back to my question in the Oval Office on Kashmir �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.Q    � you know, the thing is, you are asking both the parties to accept and one is aggressor, (inaudible) these U.N. resolutions.  And that�s non-compliant, plus � you know, merging Kashmir into its own territory.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  This is the kind of reporter I like.Q    Which is (inaudible) U.N. resolution.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I like this reporter.  (Laughter.)Q    And how can you �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you a member of this team?  Or are you a �Q    I�m a member of � I�m not a member of this team.  I�m an independent journalist.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You know what?  You�re saying � you�re saying what you think.Q    No, let me complete my question, Mr. President.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, but I have to be requesting �Q    How can you make �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.Q    � an aggressor and a (inaudible) meet and �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That�s okay.  I understand.Q    � in violation of the U.N. resolutions?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very fair question, or statement.  I�ll � let me put that one down as a statement, if you don�t mind.Q    Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But you�re right, you have to have a � they have to have two parties that want to agree.  And if they � when they come � and, at some point, India may come.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan.And if at any time they say, �You know, we have some points that we think we can maybe iron out,� I think I�d be an extremely good arbitrator.  I�ve done it before, believe it or not, and I�ve never failed as an arbitrator.  I�ve been asked to arbitrate disputes � pretty big ones � from friends.  And I�ve done it in a good, successful fashion.If I can be of help � you know that � if I can be of help, let me know.  But you�d have to have the assent also from the other side.Q    Prime Minister Johnson has now called for a new deal, just moments ago � for a new Iran deal.  This is the first time he�s called for that.  I wonder what your reaction to it.  And have you discussed that with him previously?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think that�s why he�s a winner.  That�s why he�s a man that�s going to be successful in the UK.  And I think that�s great.  You�re talking about Boris, right?Q    Yes, talking about Boris, sir.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Boris is a man who � number one, he�s a friend of mine, and, number two, he�s very smart, very tough.  And he does want a new deal because the other deal was ready to expire.  It was at a very short number of years left.  All that money paid and wasted.  You didn�t have the right to inspect the appropriate sites.  You were looking at sites that would never be used to create nuclear.  The sites that they would use, we weren�t allowed to inspect.  What kind of a deal is that?  And ballistic missiles � they�re allowed to test ballistic missiles and other things.But one of the biggest things is the fact that the agreement is going to expire in a very short number of years.  And what kind of a deal is that?  We�re dealing with countries.  You have to go long term.So, I respect Boris a lot, and I am not at all surprised that he was the first one to come out and say that.Q    Mr. President, this is the first time � (inaudible) from (inaudible) Pakistan.  So this is the first time we get honest leadership like you in America.  And in past �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree with that.  This is the first time you�ve had honesty.Q    Sir, in past �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You�ve had a lot of dishonesty, and they�ve treated Pakistan very badly.  The people in my position have treated Pakistan very badly.  I think that � I wouldn�t say Pakistan has treated us too well either, but maybe there was a reason.  And, in fact, I think there was a reason for it.Q    Sir, in past, you have said that you don�t trust Pakistan.  So, when we have honest (inaudible) �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I trust Pakistan.  But people before me didn�t, but they didn�t know what they were doing.  So it�s just one of those little problems in life.You know, I � you know what I do?  I trust this gentleman right here.  And I do trust Pakistan.  I know � I have a lot of Pakistani friends living in New York.  They�re smart.  Great negotiators, by the way, in case you had any questions.  They�re among the toughest negotiators in the world.And, you know what?  It�s all going to work out.  But if I can help, I�d like to help.  But I don�t think you�ve ever had a President that felt the way I do, in a positive way, about Pakistan.  I don�t think you have.  I�ve looked back, and I�ve seen where it was.  And � and � but I also have a very good relationship with India.  I have a good relationship with both.So, if they decide to use that feeling among both, I think we can help out.  But this has been a longstanding � this has been going on for a long time.Q    Mr. President, yesterday you shared the stage with PM Modi.  He alleged that Pakistan is the hub of terrorism.  Do you endorse that or do you disagree with that?  Because you said that Pakistan has made a lot of progress.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I really have been pointing much more to Iran.  I mean, Iran if you look at what, that�s been really the state of terror.  And I�ve been saying it�s the number one state of terror in the world.  And the agreement we had does not cover that.  It was not doing well.  It was doing very poorly.  And now Iran is doing very poorly.  Iran is a different place than when I took over.When I took over the United States � when I became President � Iran was a real threat to the entire Middle East and maybe beyond.  And now they�re having very, very big difficulties, to put it mildly.  So we�ll see.Q    Are you happy with the progress that Pakistan has made countering terrorism, particularly eliminating terrorism (inaudible)?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I�ve heard they�ve made great progress.  And under this leader � he�s a great leader � I think he wants to make great progress because there�s no solution the other way.  The other way is only going to lead to death and chaos and poverty.  It�s all it�s going to lead to.  I mean, he understands it.  Your Prime Minister understands it.Q    Are you concerned about the human rights situation in Kashmir?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  About which?Q    Human rights situation � human rights violations.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sure.  I�d like to see everything work out.  I want it to be humane.  I want everybody to be treated well.  You have two big countries, and they�re warring countries and they�ve been fighting.And � I mean, I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday.  I don�t have to say that.  I was there.  I didn�t know I was going to hear that statement, I had said.  But I was sitting there and I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday from India, from the Prime Minister, and I will say it was very well received within the rule � you know, within in the room.  The statement itself.  That was a big room; there were 59,000 people.But it was a very aggressive statement, and I hope that they�re going to be able to come together � India and Pakistan � and do something that�s really smart and good for both.  And I�m sure there could be � there�s always a solution.  And I really believe there�s a solution for that.(Cross-talk.)Easy.  Easy.  You�ve asked one already.  Go ahead.  Quickly.  Make a one-second statement.  Go ahead, make a statement.Q    Now, if you can solve this outstanding issue of Kashmir �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.Q    � very likely and definitely you will be deserving a Nobel Prize on that.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think I�ll get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things.  I think I�m going to get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they gave it out fairly, which they don�t.They gave it out � well, they gave one to Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it.  And you know what?  That was the only thing I agreed with him on.(Cross-talk.)Come on.Q    Other than Pakistan and India, the Kashmiri people are suffering the last 50 days.  They will talk later on, but right now there was human rights violation in Kashmir.  Fifty days lockdown � no Internet, no food, nothing.  So, you know, what do you want do for the Kashmiri people?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Where do you find reporters like this?  (Laughter.)  These guys are fantastic.All right, go ahead.(Cross-talk.)Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  He�s talking.  Let the American talk for a change.Q    Thank you, sir.  Have talks with the Taliban resumed in any way?  And have you looked to Pakistan leaders to help you in any way �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, we�ve hit the Taliban very hard.Q    � with assistance in Afghanistan.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, I have.  And I think that the Pakistan � I think Pakistan will be a great help.  I know the Prime Minister wants to be a help.  But we�ve hit the Taliban harder than we�ve ever hit them � in all of the years.  I guess we�ve been there now 19 years.  How ridiculous is that?  And when they killed 12 people � one of them an American soldier, as you know, and one a United Nations solider � for the sake of going into the meeting with a little strength, they thought.  They went in with weakness.  And I cancelled everything.  We have hit them harder in the last two weeks than we�ve ever hit them before.Q    When do you think talks could resume again, sir?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We�ll see what happens.  But I will say that the Prime Minister has been very helpful and he wants to do something.  He wants to see something happen.  So, that�s fine.Q    My question is on Pakistan.  Mr. Prime Minister, would you like to raise the issue of curfew and lockdown, and the atrocities in Kashmir before the President of America?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  You know, Mr. President, I was going to raise it in private, but it needs to be said that, for 50 days, 8 million people are under siege by 900,000 troops.  And it�s a humanitarian issue.  And so I was going to say that � were you supposed to meet Narendra Modi now, I would�ve asked you to at least lift the siege.  I mean, it�s a huge humanitarian crisis taking place.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, so we�re going to talking about that in a little while.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  We�ll discuss that.Q    Mr. Prime Minister, what are your expectations from American President about the Kashmir issue?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  My expectations: President Trump heads the most powerful country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world has a responsibility.  And, you know, you very kindly want to mediate this and you also said that to do both, first  India and Pakistan has to agree to mediation.But, unfortunately, India is refusing to talk to us.  So, in this situation, I feel that this is the beginning of a crisis.  I honestly feel that this crisis is going to get much bigger � what is happening in Kashmir.  So we would like to talk about that later.But just the fact that the position of the United States � it�s the most powerful country.  It can affect the United Nations Security Council.  It has a voice.  So we look to the U.S. to put out flames in the world.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And I will say this: Look, I have my respect for your Prime Minister, I will say that many countries wanted to meet with me and us � the United States � during this very short three-day period, and we were unable to meet with many of them.  One of the countries I wanted to meet with was Pakistan and your Prime Minister.  And it�s an honor to be here with you.  And I think you should let us start talking now because �PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  � but I do appreciate it.  There�s a tremendous spirit from your press.  I don�t see that.  With us, they want to always tear our country down.  And with your press, it�s really � they would like to see something positive for your country.And I will tell you this: You have a great leader.  And he�s a good man.  He�s a nice man.  Happens to be a great athlete � not that that matters, but it�s always nice.Q    You are a great leader, too, sir.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  You take care of yourselves.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks everybody.END1:18 P.M.

195,"PM Modi's aggressive remark was well received by 59,000 people: Trump","US President Donald Trump during his meeting with Pakistan PM Imran Khan said PM Narendra Modi made an aggressive statement during 'Howdy, Modi', adding that the remark was very well received by 59,000 people. Without naming Pakistan, PM Modi had criticised the country, saying that decision to revoke Article 370 has caused trouble to those who cannot handle their country.",The White House,"InterContinental New York Barclay
New York, New York1:05 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  It�s a great honor to be with my friend, the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  And we have some great discussions going on with Pakistan about a lot of things, including the Taliban and Afghanistan, and many other things.  And trade, I think, maybe is one of the most important.  We�re going to increase trade with Pakistan by a tremendous margin.We do a very small amount of trade with them, and they want to do a large, and so do we.  And we should be able to do that, I think, Wilbur, very easily.  So we�re going to double, triple, quadruple the trade.  It will be very easy to do.  They make great product, and so do we.And I was really shocked when I saw the original numbers from last year and the year before, and for many years, that the trade with Pakistan isn�t much greater.  But it could be many times the number.So we�ll be talking about trade and other things.  And it�s an honor to be with you.  Thank you very much.  Please.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I look forward, Mr. President, to talk to you about, obviously, Afghanistan, which is a big issue for us Pakistanis, because stability in Afghanistan means stability in Pakistan.  We also want to talk about all three neighbors: Afghanistan, India, Kashmir.  And, of course, Iran, it�s just � we will discuss the situation there because all � these all three neighbors of Pakistan.  And I �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He lives in a very friendly neighborhood.  (Laughter.)PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I mean, as if there are not already enough challenges.Q    Mr. President, after your last meeting with the Prime Minister, you offered to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.  And since then, the situation has gotten more complicated, and India continues to deny our access in the region.  So where does the offer stand now on (inaudible)?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It would always stand.  If I can help, I would certainly do that.  And it will be dependent on both of these gentlemen.  One without the other doesn�t work, if you�re going to do mediation or if you�re going to do an arbitration.But certainly, I would be willing to help if both wanted.  If both Pakistan, let�s say, and India wanted me to do that, I am ready, willing, and able.  It�s a complex issue.  It�s been going on for a long time.  But if both wanted it, I would be ready to do it.Q    Mr. President, with all the things � reverting back to my question in the Oval Office on Kashmir �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.Q    � you know, the thing is, you are asking both the parties to accept and one is aggressor, (inaudible) these U.N. resolutions.  And that�s non-compliant, plus � you know, merging Kashmir into its own territory.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  This is the kind of reporter I like.Q    Which is (inaudible) U.N. resolution.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I like this reporter.  (Laughter.)Q    And how can you �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you a member of this team?  Or are you a �Q    I�m a member of � I�m not a member of this team.  I�m an independent journalist.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You know what?  You�re saying � you�re saying what you think.Q    No, let me complete my question, Mr. President.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, but I have to be requesting �Q    How can you make �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.Q    � an aggressor and a (inaudible) meet and �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That�s okay.  I understand.Q    � in violation of the U.N. resolutions?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very fair question, or statement.  I�ll � let me put that one down as a statement, if you don�t mind.Q    Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But you�re right, you have to have a � they have to have two parties that want to agree.  And if they � when they come � and, at some point, India may come.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan.And if at any time they say, �You know, we have some points that we think we can maybe iron out,� I think I�d be an extremely good arbitrator.  I�ve done it before, believe it or not, and I�ve never failed as an arbitrator.  I�ve been asked to arbitrate disputes � pretty big ones � from friends.  And I�ve done it in a good, successful fashion.If I can be of help � you know that � if I can be of help, let me know.  But you�d have to have the assent also from the other side.Q    Prime Minister Johnson has now called for a new deal, just moments ago � for a new Iran deal.  This is the first time he�s called for that.  I wonder what your reaction to it.  And have you discussed that with him previously?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think that�s why he�s a winner.  That�s why he�s a man that�s going to be successful in the UK.  And I think that�s great.  You�re talking about Boris, right?Q    Yes, talking about Boris, sir.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Boris is a man who � number one, he�s a friend of mine, and, number two, he�s very smart, very tough.  And he does want a new deal because the other deal was ready to expire.  It was at a very short number of years left.  All that money paid and wasted.  You didn�t have the right to inspect the appropriate sites.  You were looking at sites that would never be used to create nuclear.  The sites that they would use, we weren�t allowed to inspect.  What kind of a deal is that?  And ballistic missiles � they�re allowed to test ballistic missiles and other things.But one of the biggest things is the fact that the agreement is going to expire in a very short number of years.  And what kind of a deal is that?  We�re dealing with countries.  You have to go long term.So, I respect Boris a lot, and I am not at all surprised that he was the first one to come out and say that.Q    Mr. President, this is the first time � (inaudible) from (inaudible) Pakistan.  So this is the first time we get honest leadership like you in America.  And in past �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree with that.  This is the first time you�ve had honesty.Q    Sir, in past �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You�ve had a lot of dishonesty, and they�ve treated Pakistan very badly.  The people in my position have treated Pakistan very badly.  I think that � I wouldn�t say Pakistan has treated us too well either, but maybe there was a reason.  And, in fact, I think there was a reason for it.Q    Sir, in past, you have said that you don�t trust Pakistan.  So, when we have honest (inaudible) �PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I trust Pakistan.  But people before me didn�t, but they didn�t know what they were doing.  So it�s just one of those little problems in life.You know, I � you know what I do?  I trust this gentleman right here.  And I do trust Pakistan.  I know � I have a lot of Pakistani friends living in New York.  They�re smart.  Great negotiators, by the way, in case you had any questions.  They�re among the toughest negotiators in the world.And, you know what?  It�s all going to work out.  But if I can help, I�d like to help.  But I don�t think you�ve ever had a President that felt the way I do, in a positive way, about Pakistan.  I don�t think you have.  I�ve looked back, and I�ve seen where it was.  And � and � but I also have a very good relationship with India.  I have a good relationship with both.So, if they decide to use that feeling among both, I think we can help out.  But this has been a longstanding � this has been going on for a long time.Q    Mr. President, yesterday you shared the stage with PM Modi.  He alleged that Pakistan is the hub of terrorism.  Do you endorse that or do you disagree with that?  Because you said that Pakistan has made a lot of progress.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I really have been pointing much more to Iran.  I mean, Iran if you look at what, that�s been really the state of terror.  And I�ve been saying it�s the number one state of terror in the world.  And the agreement we had does not cover that.  It was not doing well.  It was doing very poorly.  And now Iran is doing very poorly.  Iran is a different place than when I took over.When I took over the United States � when I became President � Iran was a real threat to the entire Middle East and maybe beyond.  And now they�re having very, very big difficulties, to put it mildly.

197,Difficult for Muslim parties to question Ayodhya is Ram's birthplace: SC,"While hearing Sunni Waqf Board and other Muslim parties' arguments in Ayodhya land dispute case, Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud said it'll be very difficult for the board and Muslim parties to question Hindu faith that Ayodhya was Lord Ram's birthplace. ""Even a Muslim witness has said that Ayodhya is to Hindus what Mecca is to Muslims,"" he stated.",India.com,"New Delhi: It would be difficult to question the faith of Hindus with regard to Ayodhya as the birthplace of Lord Ram as even some Muslim witnesses have termed it as sacred for the Hindus as Mecca is for them, the Supreme Court said Monday.A 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi was questioning senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the Muslim parties, on whether the divinity and the �exact form� of an idol or a deity were necessary to hold that they have �juristic personality�.�Even Muslim witnesses (during the trial) have said that Ayodhya to Hindus is as sacred as the Mecca is for them. It will be difficult to rebut the belief of the Hindus,� said the bench which also comprised Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer.Dhavan, arguing for Sunni Waqf Board and others including original litigant M Siddiq, said that only belief cannot be the basis to claim title and accord juristic status to the �janmsthan� (birth place).He, however, strongly pitched for granting respect to Lord Ram and the Allah in a diverse country like India on the 29th day of the hearing in the politically sensitive case.�If Lord Ram and Allah are not respected then this great nation will split apart,� said the senior lawyer but strongly objected to the move to make the birthplace as a party to the lawsuit filed on behalf of deity �Ram Lalla Viarajman� for claiming juristic status for the sacred land.At the outset, Dhavan tried to distinguish between the legal status of the deity and the birth place and said that the latter has been made a party with a sole aim to make a Ram temple at the site and to ensure that impediments such as law of limitation, adverse possession and acquisition do not come in the way.�They just say Lord Ram was born here. None of the contours of the area are mentioned anywhere in the plaint. The suit is thus merely a vehicle to destroy and build a temple.�They have argued that all existing structures be demolished at Ram Janmabhoomi and a new Temple be constructed there,� he said.The bench referred to vehement submissions of Dhavan that belief is a very �tenuous� evidence and the Hindus should establish the long worship instead.�Your (Dhavan�s) first claim is that belief is tenuous as an evidence. But your second argument is that belief should be manifested by way of an object. What exactly is the object you are talking about,� the bench asked.�Is it necessary for a deity or an idol to have divinity so as to make it a juristic personality�.The senior lawyer said there should be �some� kind of physical manifestation of a deity or an idol and even if we concede to Hindus� belief, then where are the �objective� aspects to support it.The bench also asked Dhavan to provide a list of deities or idols which, as per earlier judgements, have been granted status of juristic personalities. He, however, expressed inability to do so saying that he will have to write 18 research papers for doing it.�Assume that it (land) is the juristic personality and then what will be the consequences. Even assume that it does not have the juristic personality, then what will be the consequences,� the bench asked, added whether same logic would apply in the case of public Muslim graveyards.�The dedication and the long use are the two criteria. A public wakf can be created on these two grounds,� Dhavan said.He said that in the present case, the issue was whether the belief can be attached to an area to make a �vague� title claim and can it be said that the mosque was illegal just because it was built on �janmbhoomi�.He asked the bench to lift the veil to see whether the birthplace can be treated as juristic person and reiterated his submissions that Hindus never had the access to the inner courtyard and they were praying at �Ram Chabutara� in outer courtyard.He rebutted the submissions that the lawsuit filed by the Sunni Wakf Board on December 18, 1961, was barred by limitation and said that the cause of action, if any, to file the case arose only on the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949 when the idols were allegedly placed below the central dome.Dhavan also opposed the plea of some Hindu parties that they acquired title over the site on account of legal doctrine of �adverse possession� and said it presupposes the fact that the Muslims were the legal owner and Hindus were having �adverse possession� of the place.�There was no idol in the inner area till 1949 and the mosque was never an abandoned mosque at any point of time. It might have, at best, been unused for some time. That is their (the Hindus�) best case,� he said.Dhavan then summarised his rebuttal to the lawsuit filed on behalf of the deity.�The entire argument was based on belief from scattered sources such as Travellers accounts and Gazetteers which have been found to be inconsistent and inconclusive,� he said.The bench will resume hearing on Tuesday.The Allahabad High Court, in its judgment of 2010 on four civil lawsuits, had partitioned the 2.77-acre disputed land equally among Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the Supreme Court against the verdict.",https://www.india.com/news/india/difficult-to-question-hindu-faith-with-regards-to-ayodhya-supreme-court-3781715/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

198,European nations back US in blaming Iran for Saudi drone attack,"Britain, Germany and France backed the US and blamed Iran on Monday for a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities. The European nations also urged Iran to agree to new talks with world powers on its nuclear and missile programmes and regional security issues. Meanwhile, Iran said European partners have failed to fulfil their commitments under the 2015 nuclear pact.",Reuters,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Britain, Germany and France backed the United States and blamed Iran on Monday for an attack on Saudi oil facilities, urging Tehran to agree to new talks with world powers on its nuclear and missile programs and regional security issues. The Europeans issued a joint statement after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron met at the United Nations on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders.  But Iran ruled out the possibility of negotiating a new deal with powers, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Monday, saying European partners have failed to fulfill their commitments under a 2015 nuclear pact. European leaders have struggled to defuse a brewing confrontation between Tehran and Washington since U.S. President Donald Trump quit a deal last year that assures Iran access to world trade in return for curbs on its nuclear program. The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran and sharply tightened them. Iran has responded by gradually breaching nuclear commitments made in the 2015 accord and has set an October deadline to further scale back its nuclear obligations unless the Europeans salvage the pact by shielding Tehran�s economy from U.S. penalties.  �The time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear program as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles program and other means of delivery,� Britain, France and Germany said.   Tension rose on Sept. 14 following an attack on Saudi Arabia�s oil facilities, which Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran. Tehran denies responsibility, and Yemen�s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition, has said it carried out the attack.  �It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,� Britain, France and Germany said.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked the European nations for their statement blaming Iran, saying, �This will strengthen diplomacy and the cause of peace.� Macron has led a European push over the summer to find a compromise between the United States and Iran and wants to use the U.N. meeting as an opportunity to revive diplomacy, though his efforts have stalled in recent weeks. When asked about Macron�s attempt to mediate, U.S. President Donald Trump said: �We don�t need a mediator. ... They (Iran) know who to call.� The United States will intensify pressure on Iran, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook said in New York on Monday. The United States was seeking to address the issue through diplomacy and a multilateral effort, and there was a role for the United Nations Security Council to play, Hook said without elaborating. In an interview with U.S. network NBC on Monday, Johnson said Trump was �the one guy who can do a better deal. ... I hope there will be a Trump deal.� Trump flirted with meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while both are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, but the chances appear slim.    �We haven�t received any requests this time, yet, for a meeting and we have made it clear a request alone will not do the job,� Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told reporters in New York earlier on Monday. �A negotiation has to be for a reason, for an outcome, not just for a handshake.�  He said there are conditions for a meeting - Iran has demanded the United States lift sanctions - and then there could be a meeting between Iran, the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China - the original parties to the nuclear deal - but there would be no bilateral meeting. Speaking after he arrived in New York on Monday, Rouhani said Iran�s message to the world �is peace, stability and also we want to tell the world that the situation in the Persian Gulf is very sensitive,� the state news agency IRNA reported.  Trump has criticized the nuclear accord, negotiated under then-U.S. President Barack Obama, for �sunset� clauses by which some of its provisions will expire as well as for its failure to address Iran�s missile program and regional activities.  A senior Gulf official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gulf countries, the United States, the Europeans and others needed to engage in �collective diplomacy� to defuse tensions. �The conversation should no longer be about the JCPOA (nuclear deal) but Iran�s missile program and its regional misbehavior, which are as important if not more important - they have the potential to hold the region to ransom,� the official said.

200,My biggest personality flaw was my fierce temper: Lata Mangeshkar,"Singer Lata Mangeshkar in an interview revealed that her biggest personality flaw was her ""fierce temper"" and she had ""major temper"" issues as a child also.

The playback legend opened up in an exclusive chat.Q: It is that time of the year again?Lata: You mean my birthday? What's so special about it? It's like any other day, isn't it?Q:�No Didi. I would say it is the day the most gifted singer of civilisation was born.Lata: Aap aisa sochte hain yeh aapka badappan hai (if you think this way it's your greatness). I've never thought of myself as special.Q: Some of the world's greatest artistes, statesmen and connoisseurs of music have declared you the greatest ever...Lata: I never thought of myself as special even when those who have heard and appreciated my singing said I was. For me, the constant effort in life has been to better myself as a person and an artiste.Q: Javed Akhtar says your singing epitomises perfection. How can you improve on perfection?Lata: Oh, there are so many of my songs that are considered flawless but are actually flawed. I can hear those flaws that you can't. And believe me, I cringe every time I hear those flaws in my singing.Q: Can you point out some of your flawed' songs?Lata: No, why should I? Don't you prefer to keep believing that they are flawless?Q: You have said you constantly strive to improve yourself as a human being. In what way?Lata: My biggest personality flaw was my fierce temper. Even as a child I had a major temper issue. I would get angry very quickly. This changed as I grew older.

I've tried to follow that.Q: Didi, I know of so many who have taken advantage of your generous and forgiving nature...Lata: God bless them. I've never been vain or arrogant about my abilities, because I feel if I can sing well it is a gift that I've got from God and my parents. I always treated my singing as a special privilege. I nurtured it as a privilege.Q: What advice would you give to upcoming aspiring singers?Lata: Riyaaz (practice). Every singer who is serious about singing must do riyaaz. To this day I try to do my riyaaz as frequently as possible.Q: Despite your partiality towards popular singing, you are extraordinarily adept at singing classical songs in films such as ""Man mohana bade jhoothe"" (""Seema"") and ""Mose chal kiye jaa"" (""Guide"").Lata: The filmy classical song is not pure classical. Given a chance I'd have loved to sit with a tanpura on a stage to perform uninterrupted for two hours. But where was the time? I was recording songs round the clock.Q: Any unfulfilled dreams?Lata: I loved photography and painting. I wish I had time to pursue these interests.Q: What is your message to the world?Lata: Do your dharm and respect your karm. Success will follow. Nothing comes without hard work.

206,40 killed at wedding party due to Afghan army raid next door,"At least 40 civilians attending a wedding party were killed by explosions and gunfire during a raid by US-backed Afghan forces on an adjacent Taliban hideout, Afghan officials said. ""We were going to the bride's house... (when) suddenly the battle began,"" Mohammad Salim, a relative said. He added that Taliban and security forces ended up killing civilians during the raid.",Reuters,"HELMAND, Afghanistan/KABUL (Reuters) - At least 40 civilians attending a wedding party were killed by explosions and gunfire during a raid by U.S.-backed Afghan government forces on a nearby Islamist militant hideout, officials in Helmand province said on Monday. The raid, days after a U.S. drone strike aimed at militants hiding among farmers killed 32 pine nut harvesters, showed how civilians have borne the brunt of a war that has re-intensified since U.S.-Taliban peace talks collapsed two weeks ago. � � Afghan officials said a house being used by the Taliban to train suicide bombers was located adjacent to the bride�s home that came under fire during Sunday night�s commando assault in the Musa Qala area of Helmand in Afghanistan�s south. � � On Monday, 30-year-old Musa Qala resident Mohammad Salim carried bodies of cousins and relatives to a burial ground from a house decorated for his sister-in-law�s wedding. � � Salim and two senior provincial government officials said 40 people, including 12 children, were killed at the wedding venue when Afghan forces swooped on the house used by Taliban and al Qaeda militants to train male and female suicide bombers.  � � �We were going to the bride�s house for the henna ceremony, some of us were outside the home and some inside, (when) suddenly the battle began...We told the security forces that we were not members of the Taliban,� Salim told Reuters. � � �But both sides ended up killing civilians,� he said. Another 13 wedding party participants were injured.  A senior Afghan Defence Ministry official said the raid was against �a foreign terrorist group actively engaged in organizing terrorist attacks�. He said government forces had also destroyed a large warehouse of militants� equipment. A second ministry official said a foreign militant detonated a suicide vest that killed him and others around him, including a woman, in response to the raid. �We are aware that civilians were injured in the attack,� he said. � � Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said they joined with Afghan security forces in the Helmand operation, conducting �precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and U.S. forces.� � � Leggett said most of those killed in the operation were struck by the gunfire of militants or from detonations of their explosives caches or suicide vests. � � The Helmand governor�s office said four senior Taliban commanders and the Taliban shadow governor of Musa Qala were among those killed. Twenty-two Taliban fighters in all were killed and 14 captured, the defense ministry said. Five Pakistanis and a Bangladeshi national were among those captured. Bombing, air strikes and ground clashes between U.S.-backed government forces and militants have flared anew since the  U.S.-Taliban negotiations fell apart, and ahead of a presidential election next week. � � In the drone strike on Sept. 18 in the eastern province of Nangarhar, six local government officials said 32 pine nut harvesters were killed, 40 of whom were injured. � � Malik Khyali, 62, a resident of Khogyani district in Nangarhar, said he lost a son in the drone strike and would not forgive those who carried it out as he knew of no militants hiding among laborers in the thickly wooded area.  � � Khyali said his son Madad Khan was employed as a cook who was serving meals to pine nut harvesters when a drone crashed into their tents. �I saw body parts being collected in several sacks...If you had seen them covered with blood and dirt, you would not be able to eat for days,� he told Reuters. The Taliban have been staging near-daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks in the run-up to the presidential election on Sept. 28 in order to discourage people from voting. � � Last week a suicide bombing outside a hospital in Qalat in southern Afghanistan killed 39 people and injured 140. The Taliban said the target was a nearby building housing the regional government�s intelligence department.  � � Farah Sami, a mother of four whose three-year-old son was critically wounded in that attack, said combatants were engaged in mindless violence to justify their existence. �All sides have been killing civilians. There is no hero or villain in this long war,� she said. The United States in 2001 sent forces to Afghanistan to oust Taliban leaders after they refused to hand over members of the al Qaeda militant group behind the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Since then, U.S. forces have backed Afghan troops in war against the al Qaeda, Taliban and Islamic State groups that recruit Afghans and foreigners who mount attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and foreign forces.� �  A U.N. report released on June 30 said 717 civilian deaths were attributed to American and Afghan forces during the first six months of the year, compared with 531 blamed on militants. � � Last week President Ashraf Ghani promised measures to reduce civilian casualties. On Monday he tweeted a call for �extra caution� in military operations, and ordered investigations.  (This story corrects to attribute deaths to six government officials in paragraph 14).

213,Took the hard decision of stopping our growth in 2015: OYO Founder,"OYO Rooms Founder and CEO Ritesh Agarwal in an interview to The Financial Express said, ""In 2015, there was a time when we had a lot of complaints regarding our customer service."" ""We took the hard decision of stopping growth for four months, no matter what our shareholders said,"" he added. He called it one of the company's best decisions.",The Financial Express,"At a young age, OYO Hotels & Homes Founder and CEO (Group) Ritesh Agarwal has got his hands full in building a model that perhaps doesn�t have any precedent globally. But being the only one-of-its-kind globally, OYO might have everything to lose given the scale at which it is. But does that bother Agarwal? �That�s an interesting question. Being the only one-of-its-kind globally is a good thing for us in many ways. Our competition is with what we were yesterday,� said Agarwal who is a huge believer in Kaizen � the philosophy of continuous learning and improvement.At 25, probably the youngest entrepreneur heading a company that has a private market valuation of $5 billion �it is still Day 0,� according to Agarwal as he speaks to Sandeep Soni in a freewheeling and wide-ranging interaction more as the entrepreneur Ritesh Agarwal and less as the leader of the company that is soon to catapult into the biggest hotel chain globally. Below are the edited excerpts � part 1.Businesses say we can turn profitable whenever we want but scale comes first. I am sure this is the case with OYO as well. How does OYO�s profitability path look like?Profitability is something that is very much on our radar. We are profitable at a building-level. We have been investing in technology, talent and hotel infrastructure upgradation. On a Y-o-Y basis, we have seen that not just our buildings are operating profitably at the building level but our EBITDA has also improved by 50 per cent (on a Y-o-Y basis).We are thinking long term and are operating with a clear path of operating efficiency. The losses as a percentage of Net Realised Value have been on a steady and significant declining curve. This year, the company has seen a 4.4x Y-o-Y growth in revenue in June 2019 (versus June 2018), with 1 million rooms under management across hotels and homes; with over 200,000 rooms in India.Do you think, because of the growth so far and vision ahead, your business model is invincible now, much like what companies like Nokia or Kodak or Yahoo perhaps also thought?From my perspective, as an entrepreneur, one is wired to take risks. You, of course, need to be smart and take calculated risks, and then do all you can to make it worth the risk.�At OYO, we certainly don�t rest on our laurels. For us, it is still Day 0 and we have a long way to go. There is always room for improvement in experience and it can be achieved if one listens to the customers carefully.We place our bets on technology and innovation. While we are the first hotel chain to develop in-house technology platform and operating systems, including a suite of over 20 apps for managing all aspects of operations, we are always on the look-out for identifying and adapting to the next big thing. Case in point � IoT switches or evaluating greater use of AI as well as VR or AR for audits and hotel transformation.As an individual, what thought process you go through during testing times such as hotel partners agitation, associations questioning the company�s intent, police case etc.?That�s a very interesting question. When you scale up your business there will invariably be small groups of vested interests unwilling to see the new ground reality. If you see the history of entrepreneurship in India and elsewhere globally, there are many examples of entrepreneurs navigating their way through these challenges.�We will not bow down to the unreasonable demands of vested interest groups, a majority of which are owners running competing properties, instigating and intimidating independent hotel owners associated with OYO, and creating false public uproar or arguing against transparent pricing and quality standards introduced by OYO that can fundamentally improve customer experience.So how do you look at addressing these problems?At OYO, we often refer to this as an occupational hazard, that one has to work with keeping in mind the larger picture � 18,000+ hotel owners in India alone choosing OYO and growing with OYO. This year alone, we have had over 642 hotel owners, with hotel sales over Rs 1 crore each, a stark increase from their earnings before becoming a part of OYO. So my personal thought process is to treat the issues based on their merit. The OYO Partner Engagement Network (OPEN) is a great example of us spending our energies on identifying ways and initiatives that can add value to an OYO hotel owner�s experience. I don�t let needless speculation deter me or my team from pursuing our mission.Culturally, the business has to be flexible according to every new market it enters. How do you ensure that at OYO?Our teams across the international geographies have observed local nuances with respect to the hotel industry in each of the countries we are present in. These observations help us in highly localizing and personalizing the experience for our guests. For instance, in the Philippines, most hotel rooms also keep a copy of the Bible in the drawer/on the table in the rooms for guests. In Indonesia, most hotel rooms have the Qibla sign also known as Arah Kiblat in the local language Bahasa. As Malaysia hosts a lot of Indian tourists, the hotels provide information on the nearest Indian/South Indian restaurants.Do you think you have got everything right at OYO so far? Did you ever compromise on growth for anything?Nobody or no company in this world can say they have got everything right and it has been a perfect journey. In 2015, there was a time when we had a lot of complaints regarding our customer service. We took the hard decision of stopping growth for four months, no matter what our shareholders said. And I feel it was one of the best things we did. We focused on identifying key problem areas and finding solutions that are scalable.Today, as we scale across 800 cities and 80 countries worldwide, we adopt a problem-solving approach, identify the opportunity in the middle of every potential difficulty and cultivate cross-functional synergies to surmount obstacles.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market�s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

217,No need to fear those who impose Hindi: Journalist Ravish Kumar,"Journalist Ravish Kumar on Sunday said that there was no need to fear those who impose Hindi. ""The number of Hindi speakers appearing for UPSC exams have reduced, and in Uttar Pradesh, 10 lakh students failed Hindi,"" said Kumar. ""A taxi driver in Bengaluru knows up to five languages and there is something we can learn from that,"" added Kumar.",The News Minute,"Journalist and Ramon Magsaysay Award winner Ravish Kumar was awarded the inaugural Gauri Lankesh National Award for Journalism at a ceremony in Bengaluru on Sunday. The award was announced on September 5 on the second death anniversary of Gauri Lankesh by the Gauri Memorial Trust.Speaking while receiving the award, Ravish Kumar, the Managing Editor of NDTV India, said that the award was not a cause for celebration. ""I cannot comprehend how the people living in Bengaluru who consider themselves broad-minded can live with the fact that a reporter was shot dead on the streets. The death of a journalist is the death of the democratic system on which you trust and step outside your house thinking there is a system to protect you.""He also chose to focus his speech on the debate surrounding the imposition of Hindi over other languages in the country. ""There is no need to fear those who impose Hindi. It cannot be the language that unites the country. In the Hindi speaking states, there are no good universities or education. The number of Hindi speakers appearing for UPSC exams have reduced and in Uttar Pradesh, 10 lakh students failed Hindi...A taxi driver in Bengaluru knows up to five languages and there is something we can learn from that,"" Ravish said.Ravish also saved a few words for the Indian media, which he said, is killing the spirit of democracy. ""If you love democracy, you will have to fight the media. The media has long fought for democracy but today the situation has changed. Stop subscribing to newspapers, stop watching television channels and protest in the streets. It looks impossible today but tomorrow you will have to do it,"" said the television journalist.He accused the mainstream media of not carrying voices of dissent, stating, �Many people who come to the streets to protest are those who have voted for the current government. The media is not carrying these voices. The people who are at the protest share the photos between themselves and post it on social media in the hope that it goes viral. The media is recording this but it is not publishing these stories. The mainstream media is busy telling the voter why we are better off under the current government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.�The award was announced by the Gauri Memorial Trust and presented to Ravish by�102-year-old freedom fighter HS Doreswamy. An English news website in honour of Gauri Lankesh -�www.gaurilankeshnews.com� - was also launched which will be managed by the trust.

233,Trump says he discussed Biden in call with Ukrainian Prez,US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that he discussed ex-Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump reportedly asked Zelenskyy to probe Biden's son Hunter. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani alleged Biden tried to interfere in an investigation into a company whose board Hunter sat on.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he discussed Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son in a call with Ukraine�s president. Trump�s statement to reporters about his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came as the Democratic leader of a key congressional panel said the pursuit of Trump�s impeachment may be the �only remedy� to the situation. Trump�s call with Zelensky has been at the center of an escalating battle in Washington since Friday, when news outlets reported that Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate whether Biden, the Democratic front-runner to take on Trump in next year�s election, misused his position when he was vice president. Trump told reporters at the White House that their phone conversation was mostly congratulatory but also touched on corruption and the Bidens. �The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don�t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,� Trump said. Democrats have said that if Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden, it is tantamount to promoting foreign interference in the 2020 election.  Trump has denied doing anything improper. His allies, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have defended the president�s phone call, which, according to news reports, was the subject of a complaint made by an as-yet-unnamed whistleblower.  If an investigation shows that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden, the U.S. Congress may have no choice but to pursue impeachment, Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on Sunday. Schiff had previously shied away from calling for impeachment, but his comments on CNN�s �State of the Union� showed his stance had shifted. �If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader to do something illicit, to provide dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that conduct represents,� Schiff said. Other legislators have called for the Democratic leadership to pursue impeachment immediately, but Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far resisted calls to formally begin the process. In a letter to colleagues later on Sunday, Pelosi warned the administration against keeping the details of the whistleblower complaint secret. The administration has so far resisted sharing the details of the complaint with lawmakers. �If the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,� Pelosi wrote. Senator Mitt Romney, who has clashed with Trump in the past, sounded a rare note of concern among Trump�s fellow Republicans, many of whom have remained silent, defended Trump or escalated their attacks on Biden in the days after the reports about the Trump-Zelensky call. �If the President asked or pressured Ukraine�s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,� Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said in a Twitter post. Impeachment proceedings in Congress, which begin in the House, can lead to a president being removed from office, but Democrats would need the support of Republicans, who control the Senate.  Multiple news organizations reported on Friday that Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden�s son was involved was fired. Biden has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired but denies it was to help his son. Biden said the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases. Biden said on Saturday there should be an investigation into Trump�s call, saying it �appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.� He said he never spoke to his son about Ukraine.

234,Legal steps for UK-flagged tanker release completed: Iran,An Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei on Monday said that all legal steps had been completed for the release of the detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero. Rabiei added that he did not know when the vessel would be released. The tanker was seized by Iran while it was sailing in the Strait of Hormuz on July 19.,Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero is �free to leave,� Iran�s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Hamid Baeidinejad, said on Twitter on Monday. �The British-flagged tanker �Stena Impero�, pursuant to the completion of the judicial and legal process, is now free to leave,� he wrote. The seizure on July 19 of the ship, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, ratcheted up tensions in the region in the wake of attacks on other merchant vessels that Washington blamed on Tehran. Iran denied responsibility for those attacks, which took place along a vital international oil shipping route. An Iranian government spokesman said on Monday that all legal steps had been completed for the release of the detained tanker but that he did not know when the vessel would be released, Iranian media reported. �The legal work and administrative procedures for the release of the English tanker have been completed but I have no information on the time of the release,� said government spokesman Ali Rabiei, according to semi-official news agency ILNA. The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Rabiei as saying: �The legal work for the oil tanker is over ... and the oil tanker can move, and the decisions indicate the end of the detention.� He did not elaborate. Relations between the United States, its allies and Iran have been gradually more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact aimed at reining in Tehran�s nuclear program and imposed sanctions on it aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.

India had an ordinary batting performance that saw the Proteas winning by 9 wickets to level the three-match series 1-1. India won the second game in Mohali by seven wickets while the first match in Dharamsala was abandoned because of rain.It all happened when Kohli was batting and Hendricks was the bowler.

It has now returned to the crater, with the green-ish tinge in this iage revealing the location of the substance�A recent post on Chinese social media revealed some details about how the Chinese space agency (CNSA) was intending to detect the material.�Debate raged between the mission's driver teams and scientists and eventually, Yutu-2 was sent into the small crater to try and find more information.�A first pass was unsuccessful, but a second attempt allowed the machine to get close enough to study the substance with the on board spectrometer.�It was studied successfully, CNSA revealed, but the exact findings are still a mystery.���A team member looking at the rover's main camera in August spotted the small crater, which appeared to contain material with a colour unlike the surrounding lunar surface, Space.com reported.�Having seen the images, lunar scientists decided to postpone plans to send Yutu-2, which translates to jade rabbit, further west.Instead, the machine was ordered to check the strange material.�The rover, which is on the moon with the Chang'e-4 lunar probe, carefully approached the crater and then targeted the strangely-coloured material.�It was then that the scientists made the strange discovery, although they have so far only said that the substance was 'gel-like' and an 'unusual colour'.One possible theory which was suggested by researchers not involved with the mission is that the substance is melted glass created from meteorites striking the surface of the moon.Pictured, tracks made from Yutu-2, which translates to Jade Rabbit, near the crater where the substance was found on the far side of the moon��The Yutu-2 rover, which landed on the far side of the moon in January of this year, found the substance last month but news of the discovery has just been made publicYutu-2 has a host of instruments and will be powered by solar panels. This includes a spectrometer which was used to analyse the bizarre find��Jade Rabbit 2 weighs 308lbs (139kg) and has six individually powered wheels so it can continue to operate even if one wheel fails. It rolled on to the lunar surface from the lander via two ramps and will explore the Von Karman crater in the southern region of the far side of the moon�Chang'e is the moon goddess and wife of god Houyi in Ancient Chinese mythology.�Houyi is one of the most powerful mythological figures in China.�It is said that he shot down nine Suns to make Earth a liveable habitat for human beings.The number four in the name is a more modern-day nod to the space programme.�This spacecraft is the fourth of the Chang'e missions.��Yutu (jade rabbit) is the companion of Chang'e in the mythological stories.�This is fittingly also the name of the rover on-board Chang'e-4.�Yutu-2 is so labelled because it is the successor to Yutu-1 which was deployed from the Chang'e-3 mission earlier this decade.��Queqiao is the relay satellite and translates to Magpie Bridge.This name also stems from Ancient Chinese mythology.Queqiao, or the Magpie Bridge, is a legendary bridge which appears once a year to connect Niu Lang and Zhi Nv.Niu Lang is a cattle herder on Earth while Zhi Nv, or the Weaving Maid, is a goddess in heaven.The couple met and fell in love when Zhi Nv snuck to the 'human world' in secret to play. Their union enraged the chief goddess, Queen Mother of the West.The couple got banished to live at different sides of the Milky Way.Every year on the seventh day of the seventh month on the Lunar Calendar, thousands of magpies that are moved by the couples' love story will form the Magpie Bridge, or Queqiao, so that Niu Lang and Zhi Nv can meet each other.�This relay satellite will allow communication between the moon probe and Earth.��China's space agency previously said the current mission 'lifted the mysterious veil' from the far side of the moon, which is never seen from Earth, and 'opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration'.Because the space craft is solar powered, it has to switch off during a lunar night on the moon, during which there will be no sunlight.The temperature on a lunar night is about -180�C (-292�F) and can get high during the day, where 'insulating' components like the gold coloured layers outside the lander and rover keep them cool.Results of experiments from the mission could lead to new understandings of the challenges faced by settlers who may one day colonise our natural satellite.�Israel attempted to land on the moon earlier this year but the mission ended in disaster when the Beresheet spacecraft fell into an uncontrolled descent.

The party has also decided not to field anyone above the age of 75 years in the crucial polls.The decision was taken at a meeting of BJP's Haryana election committee on Sunday. Sources in the party said that the decision was taken after several MPs and senior state party leaders demanded tickets for their kin for the elections.It may be noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has time and again targeted opposition parties in Haryana including Congress, INLD and Jannayak Janata Party for supporting dynastic politics.""We have decided that relatives of MPs, mayors and district Council heads won't get tickets in the upcoming assembly elections. In fact, MLAs will also be discouraged from seeking tickets for their family members.

Libra will let users buy things or send money to people with nearly zero fees, Facebook had said.",Engadget,"Facebook was quick to promise that its Libra cryptocurrency would have the stability of real-world money behind it, but whose money will dominate?  It's now particularly clear.  Facebook sent a letter to German politician Fabio De Masi explaining that the US dollar will represent 50 percent of the backing for Libra.  The remaining support will come from the euro (18 percent), Japanese yen (14 percent), British pound (11 percent) and Singapore dollar (7 percent).  If you were hoping for currency representation from more parts of the world, you'll be disappointed.This isn't surprising given Facebook's home turf and the usual strength of the US dollar.  The absence of certain currencies might work in Libra's favor, too. The absence of China's yuan could appease American politicians scrutinizing the currency by assuaging their fears of Chinese influence.  US officials have long accused China of softening the yuan to help its exports, and Libra's mix would make that a non-issue.Whether or not this balance (or rather imbalance) helps is another matter.  The backing should prevent the volatility that has plagued Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but France, Germany and other countries are worried Libra might undermine their own financial systems.  Rock-solid support might not matter so much if Libra isn't available in key countries, especially those countries that are supposed to underpin the virtual money in the first place.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/22/facebook-libra-currency-backing/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe to independence and crushed his foes during nearly four decades of rule that impoverished his  country, died on Sept 6. aged 95 in Singapore.  Mnangagwa told ruling party supporters in New York where he is attending this week�s United Nations General Assembly that Mugabe had cancer, but he did not disclose the type. Mugabe is still to be buried because the government is building a mausoleum at Zimbabwe�s national shrine reserved for liberation war fighters in the capital. His body is being kept at his Blue Roof residence in Harare.     �Treatment had stopped, doctors had stopped treatment, chemotherapy, one, because of age and also because the cancer had spread and it was not helping anymore,� Mnangagwa said in comments carried by The Herald newspaper on Monday. In 2011, WikiLeaks released U.S. diplomatic cable that said  Mugabe had prostate cancer that had spread to other organs, which government officials denied. During his time in power, and before he was forced to resign after a coup in November 2017, Mugabe frequently traveled to Singapore to seek treatment.

CARE Ratings late on Friday downgraded the non-banking financial company�s (NBFC) bonds to �D� from �BB�, citing a one-day delay in coupon payments on several non-convertible debentures and stress in the group�s liquidity position. Reliance, headed by business tycoon Anil Ambani, however, said funds had been arranged by the due date and the delay was due to technical glitches in the bank�s servers.

301,Make climate fight sexy and fun: Japan's new environment minister,"Japan's new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, on Sunday pledged to mobilise young people to push his coal-dependent country toward a low-carbon future by making the fight against climate change ""sexy"" and ""fun"". ""We are committed to realising a decarbonised society, and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change,"" he added.",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japan�s new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, pledged on Sunday to mobilize young people to push his coal-dependent country toward a low-carbon future by making the fight against climate change �sexy� and �fun.� Koizumi was speaking on the eve of a United Nations climate summit in New York where activists plan to float a blimp showing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe emerging from a bucket of coal to protest Japan�s pans to build new coal-fired power plants. �In politics there are so many issues, sometimes boring. On tackling such a big-scale issue like climate change, it�s got to be fun, it�s got to be cool. It�s got to be sexy too,� Koizumi told a news conference in New York. �We are committed to realizing a decarbonised society, and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change,� he said. Japanese students in Tokyo were among the millions of young people who took to the streets on Friday to express the fear and outrage they feel over the failure of governments to control greenhouse gas emissions, which hit a record high last year. Considered a rising star on Japan�s political scene, Koizumi, 38, became the third youngest lawmaker to join a post-World War Two Japanese cabinet when Abe announced a reshuffle this month. The son of charismatic former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, he is regularly rated by voters as the lawmaker they would most like to see in the top job when Abe steps down.  Although Japan is not due to speak at the climate summit on Monday, Koizumi said he was in New York to learn more about the state of negotiations on global greenhouse gas emissions and meet Japanese students. He was speaking alongside Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming, who had invited him to meet various companies and banks aiming to accelerate investment in clean energy projects in Asia.  �It behooves the rest of the world to come together to support Japan, as well as the other Asian countries, to move beyond coal,� said Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who now leads Mission 2020, a campaign to accelerate climate action. �We need to make an extraordinary effort that will favor the new fuels that we all need to move in to,� she said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has told governments they should only turn up to the summit if they came armed with more ambitious plans to cut carbon emissions under the Paris accord, which enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Guterres has also urged governments not to build any new coal power plants after 2020 - setting him at odds with Japan, which is the only G7 country to be adding coal-fired power generation capacity. Japan�s government and banks also play an important role in financing new coal plants elsewhere in Asia. Nevertheless, Koizumi said he wanted Japan to do more on climate, invoking his country�s role in forging the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty agreed in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997.  �We haven�t taken the strong action and powerful leadership since then, but from now on, from today, we want to do more,� Koizumi said, without giving details. Koizumi sparked controversy shortly after being appointed when he told his first news conference that he wants Japan to close down nuclear reactors to avoid a repeat of the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011.

The actor further said that 'Kabir Singh' was about a flawed character who didn't know how to handle himself.",Times Now,"The biggest blockbuster of 2019, so far, is Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani starrer Kabir Singh.�A Hindi remake of the 2017 Telugu hit Arjun Reddy.�Kabir Singh�faced a lot of criticism from a section of the audience and film critics, who deemed it to be sexist and misogynist. Recently, Shahid Kapoor was present at an event where he talked about his career, the massive success of Kabir Singh and more.�When asked about the film and how he approached the character, Shahid Kapoor explained,�""If you think cinema is an educational institution that you're taught what you should or should not to do, that's your choice. Cinema is meant to mirror life. It's about representing the truth. It's an adult film, for adults, who can distinguish between right and wrong. Are you telling me that Mr Bachchan is someone who taught people to be a thief? You know you're going to watch a movie right, it's fiction, right? I've seen situations like this in life. When a couple fights, if a third person views it, they'll have a different idea. Fundamentally, they're in love. I've seen independent women date simple boys, and vice versa. That's how life is, it's unpredictable. Why is there a problem? You choose to take away what you want from the film. That's what democracy is all about.""He further added,�We promoted the film for two months. If someone's bought a ticket, they probably wanted to see something in it. The film is about a flawed character. Preeti�(Kiara Advani) is a stronger character than Kabir. Kabir doesn't know how to handle himself. Every Kabir needs a Preeti�in his life. No one brought up Baazigar, when SRK kills Shilpa Shetty. No one said anything about Ranbir Kapoor putting a commode seat on Sonam Kapoor's neck as a mangalsutra in Sanju.

361,US approves tariff exemptions for Apple on 10 imported items,The US trade regulators have approved 10 out of 15 tariff exemption requests filed by Apple on computer components imported from China. These components were among the tariffs the US imposed on $200-billion worth of Chinese imports last year. This will reportedly help Apple continue assembling Mac Pro in the US with lowered costs of importing some Mac Pro parts.,Reuters,"(Reuters) - U.S. trade regulators on Friday approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions filed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) amid a broader reprieve on levies on computer parts, according to a public docket published by the U.S. Trade Representative and a Federal Register notice. The move by U.S. officials could make it easier for both Apple and small makers of gaming computers to assemble devices in the United States by lowering the costs of importing parts. Apple did not say why it requested the exemptions, but the requests were for components such as partially completed circuit boards. Apple manufactures its Mac Pro computers in Texas, making the machine immune from tariffs, but such intermediate parts were subject to the levies. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. The Mac Pro computer starts at $6,000 and is intended for users such as music and motion picture studios. Due to its specialized design, the device has never sold in large numbers. But it became a political flashpoint earlier this year when The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was moving production to China. Apple never publicly commented on its exact production plans, but U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods complicated the assembly of PCs in the United States. The third list of U.S. tariffs that went into effect last year placed levies on both some fully assembled PCs as well as the major components to make them, meaning manufacturers faced cost increases even if they made machines in the United States.  The tariffs also hit the PC gaming industry, where enthusiasts often assemble their own custom machines from parts, many from China. Apple applied for the exemptions for some components but President Donald Trump said U.S. regulators would not grant them. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook later said during the company�s July 30 earnings call that Apple wanted to keep making Mac Pros in the United States. �We want to continue to be here,� he told analysts on the call, adding that Apple was investing in capacity to do so. On Friday, trade officials lifted tariffs on a range of computer components for Apple and all other manufacturers, including partially assembled main circuit boards and graphics cards. Those are critical to computer assemblers because they contain chips from Intel Corp (INTC.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O). Those chips are typically some of the most expensive parts in the machines.

366,Thousands march for ban on abortions in Slovakia,"Thousands marched in Slovakia's capital Bratislava on Sunday calling for a ban on abortions in the country. On-demand abortions are allowed up until 12 weeks of pregnancy while abortions for health reasons are allowed until 24 weeks. Protesters carried signs saying ""A human is human regardless of size"" and ""Who kills an unborn child kills the future of the nation"".",Reuters,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands marched in Slovakia�s capital on Sunday calling for a total ban on abortions in the predominantly Catholic central European country. Abortion laws in Slovakia are relatively liberal compared to those in countries like Poland or Malta, which have among the strictest laws in the European Union and often allow them only in cases like rape.  In Slovakia, on-demand abortions are legal up until 12 weeks of a pregnancy while abortions for health reasons are allowed until 24 weeks.  Conservative and far-right lawmakers want to allow them only to up to six or eight weeks of pregnancy or ban them outright, and parliament starts debating draft laws to restrict abortions this month. It is unclear if the proposals will become law since the ruling Smer - a leftist, socially conservative party - and junior center-right Slovak National Party in the government, have not said whether they will back any of them. Abortions have fallen in the country of 5.4 million to 6,000 last year, from almost 11,000 a decade ago. A Focus agency opinion poll this month found 55.5% of people disagreed with restricting abortions while 34.6% supported the move. Protesters carrying signs saying �A human is human regardless of size� and �Who kills an unborn child kills the future of the nation� marched in the capital on Sunday demanding a total ban on abortions, including in cases of severe birth defects or rape.  �The life of every human is invaluable, therefore it needs to be protected from conception until natural death,� one of the protest organizers, backed by the Catholic church, said on stage.  The organizers estimated turnout at the protest at about 50,000.   The ruling Smer party has led Slovakia nearly non-stop since 2006 and has built its base by lifting social benefits amid years of economic growth and backing conservative issues.  Ahead of an election next year, the party pledged to back legislation to ban gay marriage and adoption by same-sex couples. Slovak law does not recognize same-sex civil unions. The most recent official census in 2011 found 62% of the country identify as Roman Catholics, while 6% are Protestants.

367,Biden urges investigation into Trump's call to Ukrainian Prez,Former US Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday called for an investigation into reports that US President Donald Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani alleged Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into a company whose board Hunter sat on.,Reuters,"By Amanda Becker and Jonathan Landay DES MOINES, Iowa/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, on Saturday called for an investigation into reports that President Donald Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. �This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power. To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things � this is outrageous,� a visibly angry Biden said while campaigning in Iowa. �Trump is using this because he knows I�ll beat him like a drum and is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,� Biden said. Trump�s July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is at the center of an escalating battle over a whistleblower�s complaint reportedly concerning the U.S. leader�s dealings with Ukraine that the administration has refused to give Congress. The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets on Friday said Trump repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Biden, while vice president, threatened to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden�s son was involved was fired. Trump, reports said, urged Zelenskiy, a comedian who had just won election, to speak with Trump�s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, has promoted the allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter, and acknowledged that he pressed for a Ukrainian investigation. Biden has admitted threatening to withhold aid unless the prosecutor was dismissed, a demand also made by the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases. The news reports about the Zelenskiy phone call have intensified demands by Democratic lawmakers for the House of Representatives to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, and have elevated the controversy to a major campaign issue. Trump denied doing anything improper. He wrote in a series of tweets on Saturday that his conversation with Zelenskiy was �perfectly fine and routine.� He accused the �Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party� of staying �as far away as possible� from the Biden allegations. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko on Saturday denied in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet suggestions that Trump had pressured Zelenskiy. Biden, responding to a reporter�s question at the Polk County Democratic Party�s annual steak fry in Des Moines, denied that he had ever spoken to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine. �You should be looking at Trump. Everybody looked at this and everybody who�s looked at it said there�s nothing there. Ask the right question,� continued Biden. �You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?� Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of Biden�s main rivals in the Democratic primary race, reiterated in Des Moines that she believes Trump�s reported actions should be the subject of impeachment proceedings in the U.S. House of Representatives. �It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now,� Warren said in remarks at the steak fry. At the steak fry, Biden called on voters to oust Trump but did not mention Ukraine. �Above all else we must defeat Donald Trump period and stop his abuse of power,� Biden said. The House Intelligence Committee is demanding it be given the whistleblower�s complaint in line with a finding by the inspector general for the intelligence community that the matter met the legal threshold for transmission to Congress. Acting Director of National Security Joseph Maguire, however, decided against providing the complaint to the committee after he consulted with the Justice Department, and reportedly the White House. Maguire and his top lawyer contended the complaint did not meet the legal guidelines for submission to the committee, prompting Democrats to accuse Maguire of breaking the law. Three House committees already were investigating the Trump-Zelenskiy call in part because the Ukrainian government�s readout of the call appeared to show that he had encouraged Zelenskiy to pursue a Biden investigation.

368,Afghan Taliban meets Chinese Government in Beijing,"A Taliban delegation met China's special representative for Afghanistan Deng Xijun in Beijing on Sunday to discuss the group's peace talks with the United States, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said. ""The Chinese special representative said the US-Taliban deal is a good framework for the peaceful solution of the Afghan issue and they support it,"" Shaheen added.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - A Taliban delegation met China�s special representative for Afghanistan in Beijing to discuss the group�s peace talks with the United States, a spokesman for the Islamist insurgency said. The meeting, on Sunday, comes after U.S. President Donald Trump�s 11th-hour cancellation earlier this month of negotiations with the Taliban, which many had hoped would pave the way to a broader peace deal with the Afghan government and ending an 18-year war. The Taliban�s nine-member delegation traveled to Beijing and met Deng Xijun, China�s special representative for Afghanistan, said Suhail Shaheen, the Afghan group�s spokesman in Qatar, on his official Twitter account on Sunday. Qatar was where the Taliban and the United States held peace talks over the past year. �The Chinese special representative said the U.S.-Taliban deal is a good framework for the peaceful solution of the Afghan issue and they support it,� Shaheen wrote. Mullah Baradar, the Taliban delegation�s leader, said they had held a dialogue and reached a �comprehensive deal�, Shaheen tweeted. �Now, if the U.S. president cannot stay committed to his words and breaks his promise, then he is responsible for any kind of distraction and bloodshed in Afghanistan,� Baradar said, according to Shaheen. Speaking in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed that Baradar and several of his assistants came to China for exchanges in recent days. �China�s relevant foreign ministry official exchanged opinions with Baradar regarding the situation in Afghanistan and promoting Afghanistan�s peace and reconciliation process,� Geng said. Afghanistan will this coming week hold its fourth presidential elections since U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban from power in 2001. Those elections have gained importance since the collapse of the peace talks, as the negotiations could have led to the creation of an interim government, now a more distant prospect. In June, before the peace talks fell apart, another Taliban team went to China to meet with the government. At the time, a foreign ministry spokesman said China supported Afghans resolving their problems themselves through talks, and the visit was an important part of China promoting such peace talks. China�s far western region of Xinjiang shares a short border with Afghanistan. China has long worried about links between militant groups and what it says are Islamist extremists operating in Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur people, who speak a Turkic language. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday called on all countries to resist China�s demands to repatriate ethnic Uighurs, saying Beijing�s campaign in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang was an �attempt to erase its own citizens�.  Geng said Pompeo had slandered China, and that its policies in Xinjiang were fundamentally no different than what other countries had done to guard against extremism and terrorism. U.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the remote Xinjiang region. China, a close ally of Pakistan, has been deepening its economic and political ties with Kabul and is also using its influence to try to bring the two uneasy neighbors closer.

Second, the government will get Goods and Services Taxes (GST) without evasion.In an informal chat with reporters at the lobbies of the Assembly on Saturday, Cinematography Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav said that the government would take the control of online ticket sales. He said that some private online portal organisers were not showing the actual accounts for the sale of tickets and not paying the GST due to the State government. Once, the FDC portal was launched, all the private online movie ticket sites would be compulsorily routed through the FDC site. This will give no scope for the evasion of GST.READ HERE |�What Tamil Nadu government's�plan for ticket booking means for the�film industryAccording to sources, the Central government too directed all the State governments to start the online sale of movie tickets under the control of government bodies like FDC. Accordingly, several states like Tamil Nadu initiated the process. Telangana too will follow the same model very shortly. The film industry too is not against the online sale of tickets by FDC.Talasani said that the State government was studying the new model and discussing with the stakeholders. If the sale of tickets were routed through the FDC site, the accounts would be accurate and the government would get its share of GST. Talasani even had reservations over the faulty accounts being submitted by several sites like Book My Show.The Minister also recalled that the government conducted raids on the race course thus, the betting tax increased from Rs 30 lakh in the past to Rs 3 crore now, per year. He averred that once FDC's online portal was launched, the income through GST on movie tickets would increase considerably. The GST on movie tickets is currently 28 per cent.

374,Team uses cardboard cutout of unavailable player for winners' photo,"During the winners' group photo following their T20 Blast 2019 victory, Essex used a cardboard cutout of their Australian spinner Adam Zampa, who missed the semi-final and the final. The cutout showed the 27-year-old spinner celebrating a wicket posing like Hulk. Zampa missed the later stage of the tournament as he went to Australia to feature in the Marsh Cup.",CricTracker,"The T20 Blast 2019 saw the Essex county winning the finals and lifting their first Blast title. The Essex Eagles, as the T20 team is known, had made it into the finals by beating Derbyshire in the second semi-final. They faced Worcestershire, who defeated Nottinghamshire in the first semi-final.The tournament was filled with excitement and amazing performances from the majority of the players, but the best of the best came from Essex Eagles� captain Simon Harmer, who starred in both the knockout wins for his team. He had earlier picked 4/19 against Worcestershire in the semis and then managed to one-up himself in the finals, contributing with the bat as well as the ball.AdvertisementWorcestershire had been put in to bat after losing the toss, put on 145/9 with Rikki Wessels and Moeen Ali making scores in the 30s. Simon Harmer picked 3/16 and Ravi Bopara took 2/30. In the reply, Tom Westley slammed 36 in 31 balls, but quick and cheap wickets of Delport, Wheater and Ten Doeschate put Essex in trouble.But then Ravi Bopara (36*), combined with Paul Walter (14) and skipper Simon Harmer (18*) to take his team to their first-ever T20 Blast title. For Worcestershire, Ali and Parnell picked two wickets each, but it was not enough. However, the most hilarious thing was seen in the aftermath of the win, as Essex were handed over the trophy and the team members gathered for the photo-op, someone was missing in person in the lineup, but we�re still there for the picture.Adam Zampa, Essex�s Australian recruit had to leave the tournament midway to take part in the Marsh Cup. He was sorely missed as he had partnered with Harmer to form a deadly frontline spin attack that helped the champions on their journey to the finals. When the team got together for the photo-op, Essex team used a cardboard cutout of Zampa who missed the knockout stage of the Blast. The cutout was hilarious and showed Zampa celebrating a wicket in Hulk style.�We�re always told we�re a small club but we have the chance to win the double and I think we�ve shown we�re a force to be reckoned with, Harmer was quoted as saying by the Guardian. Meanwhile losing captain Moeen Ali said, �I thought they deserved to win. At one point, I thought we were winning the game but the way Ravi played was fantastic and basically won the game. As long as he was in, I always thought they were going to win.�",https://www.crictracker.com/t20-blast-2019-essex-use-adam-zampas-cutout-in-winners-photo-after-the-title-win/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

394,Chinese delegation cancels goodwill visit to US farms,"Chinese officials in the US for trade talks cancelled their goodwill visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska. Reports earlier claimed an interim deal could be reached, involving China resuming purchase of US farm goods. However, US President Donald Trump later said he wants a ""complete trade deal"" and not just an agreement for China to buy American agricultural goods.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S.-China trade deal appeared elusive on Friday after Chinese officials unexpectedly canceled a visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska as deputy trade negotiators wrapped up two days of negotiations in Washington. Chinese officials were expected to visit U.S. farmers next week as a goodwill gesture, but canceled to return to China sooner than originally scheduled, agriculture organizations from Montana and Nebraska said. The United States had removed tariffs overnight from over 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies. The Chinese Embassy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Trade Representative�s office issued a brief statement characterizing the two days as �productive� and that a principal-level trade meeting in Washington would take place in October as previously planned.  China�s Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described the talks as �constructive�, and said they had also had a good discussion on �detailed arrangements� for the high-level talks in October. �Both sides agreed to continue to maintain communication on the relevant issues,� it added, without elaborating. Trade experts, executives and government officials in both countries say that even if the September and October talks produced an interim deal, the U.S.-China trade war has hardened into a political and ideological battle that runs far deeper than tariffs and could take years to resolve. The Chinese delegation did not present any new proposals on core structural issues including intellectual property protections, forced technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers, said a person briefed on the talks.  �The conclusion from the U.S. side was that we�re not close to an agreement,� the person said. This source and another person familiar with the talks said that the Chinese delegation�s leader, Vice Finance Minister Liao Min, laid out China�s demands that any deal must remove all U.S. tariffs and be balanced so that it is not all concessions from Beijing and none from Washington.  The sources said that a lack of results from deputy meetings is not uncommon as they often are not authorized to make deals or present new offers. The early October meeting will include the top trade negotiators: Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It is expected to determine whether the world�s two largest economies are starting to chart a path out of their 14-month trade war or headed for new and higher tariffs on each others� goods. Cancellation of the Chinese agriculture visits, which were seen as potentially leading to increased purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork, caused Wall Street�s main stock indexes to fall as early optimism about the talks faded.  Grain and soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade and livestock futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also slumped. China is the world�s largest pork market and the largest importer of soybeans. Before the talks started, some reports had suggested that an interim deal was being considered, involving Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods, some improvements in Chinese market access and an easing of U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd But U.S. President Donald Trump made clear on Friday that purchases would not be enough for him to end his punitive tariffs.  �We�re looking for a complete deal. I�m not looking for a partial deal,� he told reporters, adding that he did not need a deal to happen before the 2020 presidential election. Speaking at a White House meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Trump touted the billions of dollars in U.S. tariff receipts on Chinese imports, adding that the total would soon reach $100 billion. �I will say this: we�re making a lot of progress with China,� the Republican president said. The Trump administration and China�s Communist Party remain far apart on issues that are the basis of their trade dispute, including the U.S. declaring some Chinese state companies national security risks, and Beijing�s refusal to revamp its economic model by eliminating subsidies for state companies. USTR issued three Federal Register notices on Friday to exclude a wide range of products from tariffs in response to requests from U.S. companies, which argued that the levies would cause economic hardship. The 437 exempted products range from printed circuit boards for computer graphics processors to dog collars, laminated wood flooring and miniature Christmas lights. The United States is asking that China substantially increase purchases of American soybeans and other farm commodities, a person with knowledge of the planned discussions told Reuters.

After multiple exchanges between Manu and the founders, sharing learnings with each other on the China and India landscape, Lin Bin, Co-Founder and President of Xiaomi, offered Manu the chance to join them to start their India business.At a time when India had more than 300 smartphone brands, Xiaomi went ahead with an online-only sales strategy when everyone else was spending huge marketing dollars on advertising and sponsorships.

The hostages had been split up by their captors after arguments over money, said Steed. Panahandeh was released without payment because the pirates thought he would die.  �He was released last weekend but we  had him in (the northern Somali town of) Galkayo trying to get him fit to travel. A week of trying to get him fit to travel. We had to stabilize him,� Steed said. �Nobody wants to pay for these guys because they are Baluchi,� he added. Poverty-stricken Baluchistan straddles the border between Iran and Pakistan and is riven by banditry and insurgency. Iran�s Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Saturday that the United Nations and Steed�s humanitarian group, the Hostage Support Partnership, helped with the release.  Mousavi also thanked authorities in Somalia�s semi-autonomous Puntland and in Ethiopia for their help in winning the release of Panahandeh, the state news agency IRNA said.  Three Iranians sailors are still being held, Mousavi said. �We are happy to announce we have obtained the release of one of the last hostages of Somali piracy ... 3 more seafarers remain who need our help,� Hostage Support Partnership tweeted.  Piracy off Somalia�s coast spiked in 2012 but then sharply subsided, mainly because shipping firms put better security protocols into place, including posting lookouts, sailing further away from Somalia, and hiring private security. International warships operating as part of a coalition also helped drive down the number of attacks.

412,Facebook buys Israeli hybrid chatbot startup Servicefriend,"Facebook has acquired Israel-based hybrid chatbot startup Servicefriend, to reportedly build customer service bots for its planned digital wallet 'Calibra'. Co-founded in 2015 by Ido Arad and Shahar Ben Ami, the startup provides hybrid AI-based bot technology to enterprises for the purpose of customer service. The co-founders have apparently joined Facebook within the Calibra group.",TechCrunch,"As Facebook  prepares to launch its new cryptocurrency Libra in 2020, it�s putting the pieces in place to help it run. In one of the latest developments, it has acquired Servicefriend, a startup that built bots � chat clients for messaging apps based on artificial intelligence � to help customer service teams, TechCrunch has confirmed.The news was first reported in Israel, where Servicefriend is based, after one of its investors, Roberto Singler, alerted local publication The Marker about the deal. We reached out to Ido Arad, one of the co-founders of the company, who referred our questions to a team at Facebook. Facebook then confirmed the acquisition with an Apple-like non-specific statement:�We acquire smaller tech companies from time to time.�We don�t always discuss our plans,� a Facebook spokesperson said.Several people, including Arad, his co-founder Shahar Ben Ami, and at least one�other indicate that they now work at Facebook within the Calibra digital wallet group on their LinkedIn profiles. Their jobs at the social network started this month, meaning this acquisition closed in recent weeks. (Several others indicate that they are still at Servicefriend, meaning they too may have likely made the move as well.)Although Facebook isn�t specifying what they will be working on, the most obvious area will be in building a bot � or more likely, a network of bots � for the customer service layer for the Calibra  digital wallet that Facebook is developing.Facebook�s plan is to build a range of financial services for people to use Calibra to pay out and receive Libra � for example, to send money to contacts, pay bills, top up their phones, buy things and more.It remains to be seen just how much people will trust Facebook as a provider of all these. So that is where having �human� and accessible customer service experience will be essential.�We are here for you,� Calibra notes on its welcome page, where it promises 24-7 support in WhatsApp and Messenger for its users.Servicefriend has worked on Facebook�s platform in the past: specifically it built �hybrid� bots for Messenger for companies to use to complement teams of humans, to better scale their services on messaging platforms. In one Messenger bot that Servicefriend built for Globe Telecom in the Philippines, it noted that the hybrid bot was able to bring the �agent hours� down to under 20 hours for each 1,000 customer interactions.Bots have been a relatively problematic area for Facebook. The company launched a personal assistant called M in 2015, and then bots that let users talk to businesses in 2016 on Messenger, with quite some fanfare, although the reality was that nothing really worked as well as promised, and in some cases worked significantly worse than whatever services they aimed to replace.While AI-based assistants such as Alexa have become synonymous with how a computer can carry on a conversation and provide information to humans, the consensus around bots these days is that the most workable way forward is to build services that complement, rather than completely replace, teams.For Facebook, getting its customer service on Calibra right can help it build and expand its credibility (note: another area where Servicefriend has build services is in using customer service as a marketing channel). Getting it wrong could mean issues not just with customers, but with partners and possibly regulators.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/21/facebook-servicefriend/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It was found that the firm was circumventing US visa regulations by flying in Indian employees on a B-1 visitor visa and misrepresenting the nature of their intended visit to the US. The investigation began in 2013 following a whistleblower's tip-off.,Entrackr,"Advanced analytics service provider MU Sigma has entered into an out of court settlement with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) and paid $2.5 million in fines for B1 visa fraud.�In a joint investigation conducted by US ICE, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the U.S. Department of State�s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), it was found that the management consulting firm was circumventing US visa regulations by flying in Indian employees on a B1 visitor visa and misrepresenting the nature of their intended visit to the United States.Mu Sigma, which has its US headquarter in Chicago, Illinois, operates in conjunction with its main delivery centre in Bangalore. The company was found to be employing B1 visitor visa holders under contract within the U.S.�Further, the Mu Sigma�s invitation letters for the B1 visa holder employees have falsified information about their nature of the visit to the US.�It even went to the extremes of instructing potential B1 business visitors and company handlers how to avoid detection by U.S consular and border officials.�However, the company�s shady tactics did not stop there.�According to a release by�U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement�s (ICE),��investigators found out that Mu Sigma�s employees, who were illegally working there were not paid in the US at the standard wage rate their US counterparts get. Instead, the company only paid them in India at a substantially lower India-based wage rate. The company even forced its employees to sign bond contracts that unlawfully sought reimbursement of up to $10,000 of the H-1B visa costs if an employee ceased employment before an agreed-upon date.The company used this unlawful tactic to inflate their profit margins and to be able to bid super low for contracts against US-based companies.The investigation was started back in 2013 after a whistleblower, who was a Mu Sigma employee tipped off US ICE that Mu Sigma managers were violating US government�s H-1B visa regulations by illegally employing B1 visitor visa holders under contact.This company was found to have incurred about 400 potential B1 visa violations and had issued more than 300 illegal visa bond contracts, during the defined period. Special agents also identified that at least 9 Mu Sigma senior executives and managers were actively participating in the wrongdoings.�On Aug 28, 2019, HSI�s reached a $2.5 million final global settlement with Mu Sigma for allegations of H1B and B1 visa abuse. Of the $2.5 million settlement, $1.6 million will satisfy the civil allegations, and $900,000 will satisfy the criminal allegations.

He wrote that feelings of lakhs of devotees were hurt. Singh has asked his minister son to shift the slaughterhouse to another location.",The New Indian Express,"BHOPAL: Former Madhya Pradesh minister and Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh has written to his minister son Jaivardhan Singh to immediately stop implementation of previous BJP regime�s decision to build a slaughterhouse near a temple on Bhopal�s outskirts. The veteran politician is currently under�attack from opposition BJP and right-wing Hindu groups over his recent �rapes inside temples� controversial remark,On Saturday, the septuagenarian Congress leader wrote a letter to his MP urban development minister son Jaivardhan Singh, mentioning that the former BJP government�s decision to build a slaughterhouse near a temple on outskirts of Bhopal has hurt the feelings of lakhs of devotees.In the letter, Singh has mentioned that many pilgrims visit the Kankali Temple during the Navratri. Not only is the temple is close to the Adampur Chhavni, the site of the slaughterhouse, but three more temples, including a Ram Temple and an ISCKON temple are located on the road leading to the Kankali Temple.During the previous BJP regime, a decision was taken to shift the existing slaughterhouse from Subhash Nagar to Adampur Chhavni (close to the Kankali Temple), which was opposed by the Congress workers at that time. The protests by Congress workers had forced then BJP regime to abandon the idea of building the slaughterhouse in Adampur Chhavni.But in 2017, the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) mayor and the then Chief Minister, overlooking the concerns of pilgrims and local residents, had gone ahead with the proposal and cleared the detailed project report (DPR) for building the slaughterhouse at Adampur Chhavni.�I�ve come to know that in pursuance of the previous BJP government�s decision, the BJP-ruled BMC has started the construction of the slaughterhouse, consequently hurting the sentiments of lakhs of devotees and pilgrims who will offer prayers at the Kankali Temple and other nearby temples during the coming Navratri. Lakhs of devotees are hurt by the BJP-ruled BMC to start construction of the slaughterhouse.�In the letter to his minister�s son, Singh has requested to immediately stop the implementation of the decision of the previous BJP regime by the presently BJP-ruled BMC. Further, Singh requested in the letter to shift the slaughterhouse facility elsewhere.The Congress politician�s letter to minister son assumed significance, particularly as it came just a few days after his �rapes happening inside temples� remark had triggered huge political controversy nationally, forcing even the national Congress to distance itself from his statements.On Tuesday, while addressing the Sant Samagam (conclave of Hindu seers) in presence of Chief Minister Kamal Nath in Bhopal, Singh had said �saffron-clad people are selling churan, while some people dressed in saffron robes were committing rapes and the rapes are happening inside temples. Is this our religion? God will not forgive those who have defamed our religion.�His remarks had possibly come after former BJP MP and a minister of the erstwhile Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Swami Chinmayanand, was accused by a 23-year-old student of sexual assault.Anti-Digvijaya Singh posters bearing his pictures had come out outside temples in some areas of Bhopal, appealing that Singh�s entry be banned in temples.�",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/sep/22/digvijaya-singh-writes-to-minister-son-to-stop-construction-of-slaughterhouse-near-goddess-temple-2037175.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

470,Sharad Pawars era of make-and-break politics over: Fadnavis,"Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said the ""breaking and making parties"" kind of politics practised by the NCP chief Sharad Pawar is now over. ""Opposition leaders are switching to the BJP because they have realised that the country's future is bright under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi,"" he added. Elections in Maharashtra will take place on October 21.",The Financial Express,"Launching a stinging attack on Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said the �breaking and making parties� kind of politics practiced by the NCP chief is now catching up with his party with the passage of time. Against the backdrop of a string of defections from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress to the ruling BJP and the Shiv Sena, Fadnavis said Opposition leadership has failed to instill confidence among their leaders. �Opposition leaders are switching to the BJP because they have realised that the country�s future is bright under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,� he said at the �India Today Conclave 2019� event here. Maharashtra will face single-phase elections for all 288 seats on October 21. Counting of votes will be done on October 24.As elections draw closer, top leadership of the BJP, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah, has amplified their attack on Pawar. In a rally in Nashik on Thursday, Modi slammed Pawar over his statement on Pakistani people. Earlier, Fadnavis had targetted Pawar on the same issue and said the statement was made with an eye on a particular vote bank. Asked about Pawar�s allegations the BJP-led government was issuing notices to sugar barons and pressurising them into joining the ruling camp, Fadnavis said, �Pawar Sahab used to do this and hence he thinks we also will do so. But there is a big difference between theirs and our brand of politics. We need not play the kind of politics Pawar Sahab played�. He added that Pawar once �made and broke parties�. �It was the charisma of time now that the same thing is happening to his party, the NCP, today.You need not cry foul now. The kind of politics you played, it will resonate and echo somewhere,� the chief minister said. With a string of desertions, the NCP, which was formed in 1999 by Pawar after walking out of the Congress, is facing its worst crisis in the state which it had ruled in allinace with the Congress for three consecutive terms since 2014. The CM said the BJP has inducted leaders/MLAs into his party party fold only after a background check. Leaders from NCP and Congress including Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, Udayanraje Bhosale, Ganesh Naik, Harshvardhan Patil, Shivendrasinh Bhosale, Kalidas Kolambkar, Vaibhav Pichad to name a few, have joined the BJP recently. When asked if he was the �Sharad Pawar of the 21st Century�, Fadnavis said he will rather play his own kind of politics. �The era of Sharad Pawar ji�s politics is over.The kind of politics he would play of making and breaking (of parties and MLAs) is over now. Such politics won�t work, generations have changed. People don�t accept such politics now,� Fadnavis said. The chief minister said leaders today identify themselves with the kind of politics being played by the BJP. �My government never faced any corruption charges unlike previous dispensations led by the Congress and the NCP,� he said, adding that allegations made against some members of the state Cabinet could not be proved.Meanwhile, Fadnavis said he would renounce politics if the allegation against him of transferring bank accounts of state police personnel to a private bank, where his wife holds a senior post, are proved. �The transfer of accounts happened in 2005 when the Congress-NCP combine was in power. I got married to Amruta in November 2005. I challenge any leader to prove charges against me�I will renounce politics if the charges are proved. If not, they should quit politics,� he added.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market�s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

474,Last reactor at worst US nuclear accident site finally closed,"American energy company Exelon Corp shut the last reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island power plant, site of the worst nuclear accident in American history on Friday. On March 28, 1979, the plant's second reactor experienced a cooling problem that resulted in the partial melting of the reactor and the evacuation of 14,000 people.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy company Exelon Corp EXC.N said it will shut the last reactor at the Three Mile Island power plant, site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, at noon local time on Friday. The company announced in May that it planned to shut the 45-year old unit in September due to inaction in the Pennsylvania legislature on a bill that would have subsidized the continued operation of nuclear power in the state. Paul Adams, a spokesman for Exelon, said the company will issue a statement later Friday on the planned closure. He noted Exelon never owned the unit that suffered the accident in 1979. Exelon said on its website it bought the 837-megawatt (MW) Unit 1 at Three Mile Island about 20 years after accident at Unit 2. Unit 2 is owned by FirstEnergy Corp (FE.N).  One megawatt can power about 1,000 average U.S. homes.  Nuclear services company EnergySolutions Inc said in July it was in negotiations with a unit of FirstEnergy to acquire and complete the decommissioning of Unit 2. In recent years, electricity prices have been depressed by cheap natural gas from shale fields, including the Marcellus in Pennsylvania, and by increased use of renewable power. This has reduced the amount of money power plants can make selling electricity and forced generators to shut several coal and nuclear plants in recent years. Many states, including New York, Illinois, Connecticut, New Jersey and Ohio have already adopted nuclear subsidies to keep their reactors in service to help meet carbon reduction and other goals. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania have considered legislation, but not in time for Three Mile Island. Exelon said it had to decide whether to spend the money to refuel the plant by June 1. In addition to the states, officials in U.S. President Donald Trump�s administration have also proposed programs to keep nuclear and coal plants operating longer. Nuclear power plants generated about 39% of Pennsylvania�s electricity in 2018 and have provided over 90% of its zero-carbon power, according to federal and industry data. Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, Exelon operates two reactors at Peach Bottom and two at Limerick, FirstEnergy operates two reactors at Beaver Valley, and Talen Energy owns two at Susquehanna. FirstEnergy�s bankrupt FirstEnergy Solutions unit has said it would shut Beaver Valley in 2021 unless the reactors receive some financial support from federal or state programs.

An investigation into the matter resulted in police booking the accused under sections 509 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which correspond to punishment awarded for word gesture or lewd remarks meant to insult the modesty of a woman.On the basis of the police investigation, the court framed charges against the man on October 8, 2015. According to a report, the accused entered a plea of not guilty and decided to contest the allegations in a court of law. In the course of the trial, the prosecution examined as many as four witnesses, including the complainant. The woman, in her testimony, levelled the same allegations she had stated in her complaint.However, the accused consistently denied all of the allegations and termed them entirely baseless. In his defence, he claimed that the woman accused him of outraging her modesty owing to a property dispute between them. He even called his own sister to testify in his favor.Hearing the case, metropolitan magistrate Vasundhara Azad stated that the actions of the accused amounted to making utterances or gestures intended to outrage the modesty of a woman. She further cited the complainant's medico-legal case (MLC) report. This report showed a ""linear bruise"" on the woman's body.

It emerged last year after the killing of an ethnic Pashtun man by police in the southern city of Karachi, which led to nationwide protests and turned the issue of alleged state violence against Pashtuns into a national debate. The military has accused the PTM of being funded by foreign intelligence agencies - a veiled reference to arch-foe India and its Afghan allies - to stoke unrest in Pakistan�s Pashtun lands after the Pakistani army defeated Islamist militants there.

The Houthis have insisted they are responsible for a devastating Sept. 14 assault on Saudi Arabia�s oil facilities that initially halved the kingdom�s production, but the United States and Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran.  Tehran, which support the Houthis, has denied any involvement in the attacks.     Speaking on the group�s Al Masirah TV, head of the Houthi political office Mahdi al-Mashat called for a halt to strikes on both sides and for serious talks among all players involved. �I call on all parties from different sides of the war to engage seriously in genuine negotiations that can lead to a comprehensive national reconciliation that does not exclude anyone,� said Mashat. The Saudi-led military coalition did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Houthi announcement. The Western-backed, Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the internationally recognized government in Sanaa in late 2014. Mashat said that the Houthis �would not hesitate to launch a period of great pain� if their call for peace was ignored. In the speech, Mashat boasted of the group�s rapidly improved military capabilities and said �significant advancement� would be seen in the coming period, particularly in air and missile defense. The Houthis said this week they had picked out dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh�s top Arab ally, as possible targets for future attacks.

Both my elder brothers are advocates, but I always wanted to play cricket,� Wasim, who sustained a leg injury when he was just nine, tells CricketCountry after the team was felicitated by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.Hailing from Kashmir, Wasim recalled how the current situation after scrapping Article 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir has affected cricket in the state. �There are no matches and whatever little tournaments that were taking place too have been shut,� the 26-year-old informed.READ: India�s World Series-winning physically disabled team to get cash reward from BCCI�It has affected my game as well, I really struggle hard to practice because there is nobody around. I don�t have much money to spend on my game. I just try and practice with whoever I get to play. I call some boys and ask them to bowl to me. It�s been 8 years now since the local tournaments have been stopped,� he said.However, as youngsters of his age opt for a different path, the electrical engineering graduate, now pursuing a degree in Arts and who also helps his parents run the family�s apple orchard, is determined to make it big in cricket.He owes his recent success to local star Parvez Razool, who has played one ODI and a Twenty20 International for India.�Parvez Rasool bhai and I live in the same district. I have taken plenty of tips from him and he has supported me a lot. Rasikh Salim (who played for Mumbai Indians this year), like my little brother, has also played with me. We live just about 10-12 kms away from each other, so we get to play often,� Wasim, who also plays for the local club Khan Sultans, mentored by Rasool, said.ALSO READ: JKCA uses ads on local TV channels to ask players to attend training campWasimm is a bit concerned about his future as a cricketer but believes the latest news about BCCI honouring the disabled players will be a huge boost. �I am doubtful about our future, but today�s acknowledgement by BCCI and the government of India is a step in the right direction, so let�s hope for the best. Nitin Gadkari saab has asked us to keep performing and they will support us, so Inshaallah, I will keep performing,� he said.He might be passionate about cricket but as far as financial security goes, Wasim hopes to land a government job. �I�ve got a lot of offers from private companies, but if I get a government job, it will be the best.

It had said it would verify accounts based on authenticity and prominence, rather than for having over 1 lakh subscribers. After many creators criticised YouTube over losing their verification badge, YouTube said already verified channels will now remain verified.",TechCrunch,"Less than 24 hours after YouTube  announced that it would be changing its creator verification process, CEO Susan Wojcicki admitted that the news hasn�t gone over very well.�To our creators & users � I�m sorry for the frustration & hurt that we caused with our new approach to verification,� Wojcicki tweeted. �While trying to make improvements, we missed the mark. As I write this, we�re working to address your concerns & we�ll have more updates soon.�The stated goal of the changes was to make it clear that verification isn�t an endorsement from YouTube, but simply a statement that the creator really is who they claim to be. This distinction became increasingly important as YouTube faced criticism for allowing the spread of hate speech and misinformation, with executives then�defending the service as an open platform.So moving forward, YouTube said it would focus on verifying public figures, famous brands and well-known creators � rather than allowing any account with more than 100,000 subscribers to request verification.As a result of the new policy, numerous YouTube creators (including some with millions of subscribers) were notified they would be losing their verified status. Naturally, they went public with their unhappiness. (The news also led to some false alarms, like complaints that popular YouTuber PewDiePie had lost his checkmark, when he had not.)While it remains to be seen how extensively YouTube will be revising or reversing its plans � and whether creators will be satisfied � this still seems like a clear mea culpa from YouTube leadership.Update, September 21: YouTube offered more details about its new plans, saying that channels with a verification badge will keep that badge without needing to appeal, and that channels with more than 100,000 subscribers will still be able to apply for verification. Due to all the changes, the new verification badge will now roll out next year.Here�s the email sent to creators:YouTube�s Neal Mohan is coming to Disrupt SF",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/youtube-verification-reversal/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

498,Government proposes social security benefits for gig workers,"The government in its draft social security code has proposed providing life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits, and old age protection to gig workers, estimated to be millions in number across India. Gig workers are people who earn from temporary or freelance arrangements outside of the traditional employer-employee relationship, working for the likes of Swiggy, Zomato and Ola.",Entrackr,"The gig economy has been thriving in India. Uber, Ola, Swiggy, Zomato, Rapido, Bounce, Vogo and many others engage over 5 million gig workers altogether. If we include all Internet-based businesses, then the figure may go up to 10 million or even beyond.Since the number of such workers is going to proliferate, the government has recognised them under draft Code on Social Security, 2019. According to a proposal draft made by labour and employment ministry, gig workers will have insurance (life and disability), health and maternity benefits, old-age protection and several other rights.The draft includes people working with marketplaces and any other form of digital intermediaries. It essentially means that people working with Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm without being on their payroll will also be entitled to the rights mentioned above.However, they won�t be entitled to benefits under the Employees� Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees� State Insurance schemes.As per the draft law, gig workers are defined as people who participate in a work arrangement system and earn livelihood via activities outside the traditional relationship between employer and employees. The term can also be referred to as higher-skilled workers like coders or technology professionals working part-time or as freelancers.In the last few years, the number of these workers has grown. According to human resource consultancy firm Noble House report, close to 70% Indian companies hired gig workers once last year.While the number of gig workers has been going north, there has been no social security system to take care of them in the country.If and when the draft code turns into law, the government will further define the role of firms which hire them.Observers hailed the move but cautioned against overregulation. They raised concern around the implementation of the policy across digital businesses such as taxi aggregators, food apps, and workforce supplier platforms.Over regulations can burden such companies with extra cost, which will indirectly impact gig workers. Recently, the US had approved a similar law for gig workers, giving them wage benefits and protection.The development was first reported by Business Standard.",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/social-security-benefits-gig-workers/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

499,Tesla board must face trial over Musk's high pay package: Judge,"The board of electric vehicle maker Tesla must defend CEO Elon Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package at a trial, a US judge has ruled. A shareholder lawsuit had alleged the package unjustly enriched Musk. The pay deal includes no salary or cash bonuses for Musk, rather setting compensation based on Tesla's market value growing to $650 billion over the next decade.",Reuters,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Tesla Inc�s (TSLA.O) board of directors must defend at a trial Chief Executive Elon Musk�s multibillion dollar pay package, which a shareholder lawsuit said unjustly enriched the head of the electric vehicle company. Tesla estimated the 2018 compensation package was worth $2.6 billion when it received stockholder approval in March 2018, although stock analysts at the time said it could be worth up to $70 billion if the company - which has yet to post an annual profit - grew quickly. The compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire Musk, but sets rewards based on Tesla�s market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next decade. On Friday, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled against Tesla�s request to dismiss the lawsuit by shareholder Richard Tornetta at an initial phase in the litigation because of the way the board approved the package. As a result, the board must now defend against allegations that it breached its fiduciary duty in approving the package, and that the package unfairly enriches Tesla�s CEO. The ruling opens the way for additional discovery into the decision-making process. Tornetta had asked that the pay package be rescinded and the board of Tesla be overhauled to better protect investors. The ruling turned on Tesla�s compensation committee, which the company conceded was not independent of Musk, according to Slight�s opinion. Had the package been negotiated by truly independent directors and approved by a majority of shareholders who were unaffiliated with Musk, Slights said he would have dismissed the lawsuit.  �Plaintiff has well pled, however, that the board level review was not divorced from Musk�s influence,� Slights wrote. Musk�s compensation package passed shareholder approval with about 73 percent of votes cast, excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal. The vote result indicated some, but not all, big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company, which has struggled to produce its electric vehicles efficiently and profitably.  At the time, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the compensation, noting that if achieved Musk�s award would surpass anything previously granted to top U.S. executives. Under the award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla�s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder. The package does not require Tesla  to hit profitability metrics.  Musk does not hold a majority of the Tesla�s stock, but in a separate case, Slights determined that Musk�s sway over Tesla made him in effect a controller from a legal standpoint. As a controller, the board is subject to a higher standard of legal oversight for decisions it makes regarding its relationship with Musk. The judge did dismiss Tornetta�s claim that the package amounted to a waste of corporate assets.

509,Cap that gently shocks the scalp could reverse baldness: Study,"A University of Wisconsin-Madison research has found that a cap-like device that would send shocks to the scalp could help reverse baldness. This new hair-growth technology aims to stimulate skin with gentle, low-frequency electric pulses, which would coax dormant hair follicles to reactivate hair production. This could be used as an intervention for people in early stages of pattern baldness.",India.com,"There is good news for people experiencing hair loss as researchers have developed a wearable device that harnesses energy from the wearer and delivers gentle electric pulses to stimulate dormant hair follicles and regrow hair.Because the devices are powered by the movement of the wearer, they do not require a bulky battery pack or complicated electronics.In fact, they are so low-profile that they could be discreetly worn underneath the crown of an everyday baseball cap.�I think this will be a very practical solution to hair regeneration,� said one of the researchers Xudong Wang, Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.In side-by-side tests on hairless mice, the devices stimulated hair growth just as effectively as two different compounds found in baldness medicines, said the study published in the journal ACS Nano.Based on devices that gather energy from a body�s day-to-day motion, the hair growth technology stimulates the skin with gentle, low-frequency electric pulses, which coax dormant follicles to reactivate hair production.The devices do not cause hair follicles to sprout anew in smooth skin. Instead, they reactivate hair-producing structures that have gone dormant.That means they could be used as an intervention for people in the early stages of pattern baldness, but they would not bestow cascading tresses to someone who has been as bald as a billiard ball for several years.Explaining the hair-growth technology, the researchers said that small devices called nanogenerators passively gather energy from day-to-day movements and then transmit low-frequency pulses of electricity to the skin. That gentle electric stimulation causes dormant follicles to �wake up.��Electric stimulations can help many different body functions,� Wang said.�But before our work, there was no really good solution for low-profile devices that provide gentle but effective stimulations,� Wang said.",https://www.india.com/lifestyle/grow-hair-on-bald-head-with-this-new-wearable-device-read-on-3779460/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

510,Protein behind slow bone fracture-healing found: Study,"Duke University researchers have found protein ApoE (Apolipoprotein E) slows down bone fracture-healing through experiments on mice. ""When we decreased the protein level, ageing was reversed,"" a researcher said, adding, ""Not only was there more bone and healing happened faster, but it was also structurally more sound."" The mice were injected with a virus to block ApoE.",ANI,"Washington D.C. [USA], Sept 20 (ANI): Researchers have found that a few proteins which are more prevalent in older people prevent the fractured bones from healing.Duke Scientists hope this discovery will lead to new treatments to help people heal after injuries or surgeries.""When we decreased the protein level, aging was reversed,"" said senior author Gurpreet Baht, Ph.D. and assistant professor in the Duke Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. ""Not only was there more bone and healing happened faster, but it was also structurally more sound.""Baht's team confirmed that older people have more Apolipoprotein E, ApoE for short, than younger people, reported the study published in JCI Insight.They wanted to figure out if and how ApoE affects the multi-step process of bone healing.When you break a bone, your body sends signals through the bloodstream to recruit cells to fix it.At last a different kind of cell eats up the cartilage scaffolds and osteoblasts fill those holes with bone.""Over time, this cartilage will continue to be resorbed and osteoblasts will continue to deposit new bone,"" Baht explained. ""After a few months of your arm or leg healing, there will be almost no cartilage anymore. And if you were to look at it five years out, there'd be no sign of an injury anymore.""That's if the bone healing process works perfectly. But the researchers found that if they added ApoE to a petri dish with skeletal stem cells, fewer cells developed into osteoblasts and the osteoblasts were worse at building bones.""We wanted to see if the cell population was more or less capable of becoming osteoblasts,"" Baht said. ""[Normally,] you put these cells down in a petri dish for about a month and the dish becomes so hard that you can't even scratch the surface because they've made two-dimensional bone there. ApoE-treated cells are still able to do this, they just don't do it as much or as well.""Next, the researchers created an intervention by injecting a virus which keeps mice from making Apolipoprotein E. Circulating ApoE levels dropped by 75 per cent and the healed bones contained one and a half-times more strong, hard bone tissue than bones of untreated mice.The research was supported by the Duke Centre for the Study of Aging and Human Development and Claude D.

514,Delhi cab drivers start keeping condoms to avoid challans amid rumours,"Many cab drivers in Delhi have started carrying condoms in the first-aid kit of their cabs after rumours that not having them would invite a fine under Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules. Meanwhile, Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi President said carrying condoms was compulsory, adding that it can be used for medical purposes like to stop someone's bleeding.",Times Now,"New Delhi: Cab drivers in the national capital are now carrying condoms in the first-aid boxes of their vehicles. The drivers believe that it is mandatory for them�to carry bandages, antiseptic liquid, emergency medicines and a box of condoms in their cars.�The new list of challans for traffic violations has left the vehicle owners in stress across the country. While a lot of people are stressed with over speeding and not wearing helmets, Ola and Uber drivers in Delhi are stressed over carrying condoms.�The cab drivers operating in the Delhi-NCR region have become cautious to ensure that a challan is not issued to them for not carrying condoms. Kamaljeet Gill, president of the Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi said, ""It is compulsory for all public service vehicles to carry three condoms at all times, which is kept inside the first aid box. ""While one might assume that the condoms are for 'protection', they are mainly for medical emergencies that the drivers might encounter. Gill said that the cab drivers have been instructed to keep the condoms as they can be used on a passenger who has suffered a cut or has broken a bone.�Kamaljeet Gill�said, ""In case a person starts bleeding, the condom can be used to stop it. Similarly, if someone has a fracture, a condom can be tied around the area until he reaches a hospital. There are non-medical benefits of condoms as well. It can hold up to three litres of liquid. ""The cab drivers, however, are still confused about the importance of carrying condoms in their cars. They are unaware of the rule that makes it compulsory for them to carry condoms. Ramesh Pal, a cab driver working in Delhi said that he started keeping condoms in his first-aid box after other cab drivers told him to.�He said that while he has never been asked by a traffic cop to produce a condom, he has been questioned about the same at the annual fitness test at the transport authority's office. The traffic police officials denied asking any of the drivers if they were carrying condoms while checking their vehicles.�A traffic police official said, ""No driver is asked if he's carrying condoms during fitness tests at our vehicle checking centre. However, NGO workers reach out to drivers outside the centre to educate them about safe sex. It is possible that drivers have developed the habit of keeping condoms from there. ""The Delhi Motor Vehicle Rules (1993) does not mandate the carrying of condoms in the vehicle. It says that all taxis should carry a first aid box with sterilized finger dressing, body dressing, hand or foot dressing, two large and three small burn dressings, two 15 grams packets of cotton, a bottle of tincture iodine, sal volatile, one empty bottle fitted with dropper for the eyes and one medicine glass.

516,"3,000 out of 20 lakh FB volunteers reach Area 51 to 'see aliens'","Out of the over 20 lakh people who signed up for a Facebook event to ""storm"" Area 51 in US' Nevada to ""see aliens"", only 3,000 turned up at the US military base. There have been several conspiracy theories related to Area 51, most importantly those pertaining to the US government's cover-up of secrets related to UFOs and aliens.",Reuters,"RACHEL, Nev. (Reuters) - UFO enthusiasts drawn by alien-themed festivities poured into rural Nevada on Friday near the Area 51 U.S. military base, but fears of a mass raid on the remote site or a public safety crisis proved unfounded, with only five people arrested. More than 3,000 out-of-towners ventured on Thursday and Friday to the desert region around Area 51, a secretive U.S. Air Force installation long rumored to house government secrets about extraterrestrial life and spaceships. The pilgrimage and two festivals welcoming the visitors were organized after a Facebook user jokingly exhorted readers to �storm� Area 51 on Sept. 20 �to see them aliens.� The date chosen for the gathering was never explained.      Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said the region�s guests were largely well behaved, with just a few exceptions. �I don�t want to jinx myself, but so far it�s gone pretty well,� he said on Friday afternoon. Three people were arrested on suspicion of trespassing onto the grounds of Area 51, Lee said. Another was arrested for indecent exposure after urinating near an entrance to the base, and a fifth for an alcohol-related incident, Lee said. A steady stream of cars continued rolling into the county on Friday for events that were scheduled to run through the weekend. The arrests were reported after a group of about 150 UFO fans and curiosity-seekers gathered outside the heavily guarded entrance to Area 51 around 3 a.m. on Friday, the date and time set by the social-media invitation that went viral. One man wore an orange space suit and some sported tin foil hats and alien masks. A sign among the gathering read �Free E.T. from the government.� �A bunch of random people in weird costumes standing outside of a government base, why would you want to miss that?� said a YouTube personality who goes by the name Atozy. �That�s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.� One young woman ducked under a protective gate and was momentarily detained by authorities and released. Most showed no interest in crossing the barrier, according to law enforcement officials keeping watch over the crowd. �They�re just here to see what�s going on,� said Sergeant Orlando Guerra of the Nevada Department of Public Safety Investigation Division. �They�re here to have fun.� The Air Force had issued a stern warning to the public not to trespass on the installation, which it said is used to test aircraft and train personnel. Area 51 had long been shrouded in mystery, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of its alien crew from a supposed unidentified flying object crash in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The U.S. government did not confirm the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes.  The documents, however, did not end suspicion about space aliens there. Area 51 sits about 12 miles (19 km) from the tiny town of Rachel, a community of about 50 year-round residents north of Las Vegas that hosted a music festival to entertain those traveling to the region.  Some residents had urged the public to stay away for fear the town would be overwhelmed with unruly tourists.   As of early Friday, about 3,000 people had pitched camp in town, most of them outside the Little A�Le�Inn, an alien-themed motel and restaurant that is Rachel�s only business. Another 250 attended a separate event 40 miles away in Hiko that featured musicians and ufologists. Ed Callahan, 49, who drove from Victorville, California, to Rachel, described the atmosphere as �just chill.�  �It�s not this big, wild thing,� said Callahan, who sported a cowboy hat covered in tin foil and silver tentacles. �When they said 40,000 people, I didn�t want it to be that. If a few more people show up, it�d be all right.� Connie West, the Little A�Le�Inn co-owner who scrambled over three months to mobilize for an influx of alien fans, said she was gratified that chaos failed to ensue. �I�m relieved the naysayers were proven wrong,� she said.

518,US signs deal to send asylum seekers to El Salvador,"The US signed a deal with El Salvador on Friday to help the Central American nation give refuge to more asylum seekers. Individuals arriving at the US-Mexico border through El Salvador should be able to seek protection there even if they intend to apply for asylum in the US, US' Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States and El Salvador on Friday agreed to attempt to reduce the flow of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border by strengthening El Salvador�s capacity to provide for asylum seekers, but did not detail any concrete actions. �The core of this is recognising El Salvador�s development of their own asylum system and committing to help them build that capacity,� Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told reporters in Washington after signing documents with El Salvador�s minister of foreign affairs, Alexandra Hill. �Individuals crossing through El Salvador should be able to seek protections� in the Central American country even if they were intending to apply for asylum in the United States, he added. Neither official said when the arrangement would take effect or provide details on how it would be administered. It was unclear how such a deal would work, given that most migrants from other countries take routes that avoid crossing the small, poverty-stricken El Salvador.         �We are going to work out operational details. This is just a broad agreement,� Hill told Reuters upon leaving the signing ceremony. The agreement represents the latest effort by McAleenan to seal immigration deals with the Northern Triangle countries of Central America - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - from where many immigrants arriving at the U.S. southern border set out. U.S. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a centrepiece of his administration and is pushing to staunch the flow of migrants - many of them families - crossing into the United States. Border crossings reached record highs earlier this year, frustrating Trump.  Guatemala has signed a so-called �safe third country� deal with the United States that requires asylum seekers who travel through Guatemala on the way to the U.S.-Mexico border to ask for refuge in Guatemala first, instead of in the United States. The Guatemalan Congress, however, has not ratified the deal.  The United States has a similar safe third country agreement with Canada.��  Honduras, meanwhile, held talks with the United States over migration this week that will continue into next, Honduras� foreign ministry and the U.S. Embassy said in a joint statement on Friday.  Among the topics under discussion is the possibility of requiring Cuban migrants to seek asylum in Honduras rather than the United States. Citing fears that the United States could retaliate against Honduran exports, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told local television on Thursday that there was a need for a region-wide agreement with Mexico, Guatemala and the United States, given increasing numbers of migrants from Cuba and Africa traversing Central America to reach the United States. �So we believe that Honduras should also become a safe country to avoid the situation becoming more complicated,� Hernandez said.  Immigration advocates have criticized the deals, saying Central American countries where many people are fleeing from violence, poverty and endemic corruption, do not have the capacity to process more asylum claims and cannot assure safety for vulnerable migrants.  �The real goal of the United States is to make sure these (asylum) claims are never heard in a U.S. court,� said Douglas Rivlin, spokesman for Washington-based pro-immigration group America�s Voice, following the U.S.-El Salvador agreement. El Salvador, which has 6.6 million people, is one of the world�s most violent nations, largely due to criminal gangs involved in drug trafficking and extortion.  As the U.S. government has pursued the deals, the Department of Homeland Security in parallel issued a rule that would bar most migrants from gaining U.S. asylum if they had not sought safe haven in any country they first transited through.  The rule accomplishes virtually the same thing as the agreements, but it has faced legal challenges. A federal court initially blocked the rule from taking effect, but the Supreme Court on Sept. 11 allowed it to be implemented while the court challenges are ongoing.

The Indian Ocean island chain has been caught in a battle for influence between India and China, which invested millions of dollars during the rule of the pro-China former leader Abdulla Yameen as part of China�s Belt and Road plan, designed to improve its global trade reach. The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party, which won a landslide in the archipelago�s parliamentary election in April, fears the debts to China could run as high as $3 billion and risk sinking the economy. Meeting Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid in Beijing, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi said China�s cooperation with the Maldives would not be affected by the change of government, China�s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Friday. �China�s cooperation with the Maldives aims to promote the well-being of the Maldivian people, without political intentions and without seeking geopolitical interests,� the ministry cited Wang as saying.  China provides what help it can to the Maldives without attaching political preconditions, and does not interfere in the its internal affairs, Wang added. �It is totally without basis to say that �the Maldives is mired in a Chinese debt trap�,� he said. The Chinese statement quoted Shahid as saying no country in the world had been as generous to helping the Maldives, pointing to the building of infrastructure and �provision of a large amount of aid and loans�. �In this regard, there is absolutely no so-called �debt trap�. To say that is complete nonsense.� China has been stung by criticism, mostly from Western countries, that it loads up poor, developing nations with unsustainable debt they have no hope of paying back, and that it is seeking to use this to leverage political influence. China says its loans are much welcomed and much needed, and points out that it provides them with no political pre-conditions and gives funds to places that Western donors ignore.

The other claimed Blatt �bullied� him into �lying to the banks to depress Tinder�s value.�Rad�s lawyer said payments made to the employees were to partly compensate them for the losses they suffered from being fired for siding with Rad.�After Tinder employees sued, IAC/Match retaliated by firing them and stripping away their hard-earned equity,� Orin Snyder, Rad�s lawyer, said in an emailed statement. �The accusation that any payments were made in exchange for witness testimony is nonsense.�Rad and other early Tinder employees alleged in 2018 that IAC cheated Tinder�s early employees by purposefully suppressing Tinder�s valuation in 2017. That meant their shares were worth less, they argued, and also meant IAC didn�t have to pay them as much when they decided to cash out.IAC says the employees are bitter because they cashed out too early.New York State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla in Manhattan in June denied IAC�s request to dismiss the lawsuit, although she threw out some claims, including unjust enrichment and a merger-related breach of contract claim. She allowed claims of breach of contract and tortious interference, to go ahead.The case is Rad v.

A few Club Factory parcels were reportedly seized in Mumbai in June.",TechCircle,"Chinese ecommerce platform ClubFactory is in the crosshairs of the Delhi commissioner of customs over non-compliance with Customs Act 1962.Goods imported by the company were confiscated by the office of the commissioner of customs (air cargo export) as they were found to be mis-declared as business to business (B2B) shipment while the department found it to be business to consumer (B2C) shipment, according to the preliminary investigations.Documents reviewed by TechCircle show that Globemax Commerce India, a fully owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-registered holding company of ClubFactory A2Z Trade, has been asked to submit documentation to further the investigation.Globemax Commerce India has been asked to submit its balance sheets, auditor reports and sale and purchase ledgers dating back to five years as well as the copy of the agreement with its foreign supplier.If found to be non-compliant under the Customs Act, ClubFactory will be required to deposit the due amount as part of customs duty as well as penalty or, in extreme cases, might lead to criminal proceedings.�If the documents filed by the company were falsified, the customs officials can ask the company to pay a penalty of up to five times the value of goods under the provisions of Section 114 AA of Customs Act.

The cause of the crash is under investigation, police officials said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said on Twitter that it was sending diplomatic personnel to the area to further assist the victims.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - A bus carrying Chinese tourists careened off a road and crashed near Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah on Friday, killing four people and injuring the remaining 26 people aboard, several of them critically, authorities reported. The cause of the crash, which occurred at about 11:30 a.m. on State Route 12 just west of the park, was under investigation, but weather did not appear to be a factor, state Highway Patrol and Garfield County Sheriff�s Department officials said. Thirty people, including the driver, were aboard the bus when it swerved across the road and back before rolling over against a guard rail and coming to rest upright, authorities said. Photos from the scene showed the vehicle�s roof crushed in on top of the passenger compartment. The 26 survivors were taken to various hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening, according to a Utah Highway Patrol spokesman, Corporal Chris Bishop. At least five people were critically injured, Bishop said, noting that figure was a downward revision from the Highway Patrol�s initial report that 12 to 15 people were critically injured. Sheriff�s spokeswoman Denise Dastrup said five of the injured were evacuated to hospitals by helicopter. All 29 passengers on the bus were citizens of mainland China, and the driver was Chinese-American, Bishop said. Dastrup said the driver survived the crash, but his condition was not immediately known. Because nearly all the victims spoke only Mandarin, communication proved a challenge to authorities, who called for volunteers to help as translators at hospitals where the injured were taken, Dastrup said.  The Chinese Embassy in Washington said on Twitter that it was sending diplomatic personnel to the area to further assist the victims. �We are saddened to hear about the accident in Utah involving a bus carrying Chinese tourists. We are thankful to authorities in Utah for their assistance,� the embassy said.      A 14-mile (23 km) stretch of highway around the crash site was shut down in both directions to make way for emergency personnel and accident investigators, Bishop said. Bryce Canyon National Park, best known for its spired, multi-hued rock formations called hoodoos, remained open to visitors, though traffic to the park was restricted. While all inbound routes to Bryce Canyon from the north, south and west pass were blocked by the crash site on SR-12, alternate routes from the west were open, park spokesman Peter Densmore said. At the time of the crash, Dastrup said, the bus was headed toward Bryce Canyon, located about 270 miles (435 km) south of Salt Lake City, and skies were clear. The national park, occupying 55 square miles (14,245 hectares) of southern Utah, attracts some 2 million visitors a year.

550,"Iran says new US sanctions target Iranians' access to food, medicine","Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday denounced renewed US sanctions against its central bank as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine. ""When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under maximum pressure has failed,"" he said.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will pursue any aggressor, even if it carries out a limited attack, and seek to destroy it, the head of the elite Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday, after attacks on Saudi oil sites which Riyadh and U.S officials blamed on Tehran.    �Be careful, a limited aggression will not remain limited. We will pursue any aggressor,� the head of the Guards, Major General Hossein Salami, said in remarks broadcast on state TV. �We are after punishment and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.�  U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia�s air and missile defences after the Sept. 14 attacks. Iran denies involvement in the attack, which was claimed by Yemen�s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran and currently fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen�s civil war. Trump�s move drew fire in Washington on Saturday from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it his �latest outrageous attempt� to circumvent Congress.  �These unacceptable actions are cause for alarm,� Pelosi said in a statement accusing Trump of turning �a blind eye� to Saudi violence against innocent Yemenis, human rights abuses and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. �The United States cannot enable more brutality and bloodshed,� she added. �Congress will do our job to uphold the Constitution, defend our national security and protect the American people.�   Meanwhile, Amirali Hajizadeh, who heads the Revolutionary Guards� aerospace branch, said any attacks on Iran would receive �a crushing response�, the official news agency IRNA reported. Hajizadeh was speaking at a public exposition called �Hunting Vultures�, where remains of drones which were downed in Iran or crashed there were displayed, along with the Iranian air defence system which shot down a U.S. military drone in June.  The exposition is part of annual events commemorating the start of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, which also includes air and naval displays in the Gulf and military parades on Sunday.        Iran�s foreign minister meanwhile denounced renewed U.S. sanctions against its central bank following the Saudi attacks as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine, and said the move was a sign of U.S. desperation. The United States on Friday imposed more sanctions, targeting the Central Bank of Iran, which was already under U.S. sanctions, the National Development Fund of Iran - the country�s sovereign wealth fund - and an Iranian company that U.S. officials say is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases. �This is a sign of U.S. desperation ... When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under �maximum pressure� has failed,� Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in remarks shown on state television. �But this is dangerous and unacceptable as an attempt at blocking ... the Iranian people�s access to food and medicine,� Zarif said, speaking after arriving in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly next week. Separately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi rejected what he called �unreal and repetitious accusations by certain Saudi officials� about the attacks, state media said. A senior Saudi official said earlier that Riyadh would wait for the results of a probe before responding to the attacks on its oil facilities, for which it believes Iran is responsible.  Zarif said he would on Wednesday meet foreign ministers of the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was agreed with Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia as well as the United States.   �As we have said before, the United States can only attend if it returns to the (nuclear accord) ... and ends its economic war against Iran,� Zarif said. The United States withdrew from the accord last year and re-imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran. After reports on social media of a cyber-attack on some  petrochemical and other companies in Iran, a state body in charge of cyber security denied there had been a �successful� attack. �Based on our observations ... there has not been a successful cyber-attack on oil facilities and other critical infrastructure,� said an official statement carried by IRNA. NetBlocks, an organisation that monitors internet connectivity, earlier reported �intermittent disruptions� to some internet services in Iran starting on Friday evening.  The group said the impact was limited, affecting only specific providers, and the cause was unclear. �Data are consistent with a cyber-attack or unplanned technical incident on affected networks as opposed to a purposeful withdrawal or shutdown incident,� it said in a tweet.  NetBlocks Director Alp Toker said they saw four Iranian networks falling offline over a three hour period on Friday evening. This began when the first reports emerged and ended shortly afterwards. The networks have been stable since.

Aramco is shipping equipment from the US and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities.",Reuters,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has emerged from attacks on its oil facilities �stronger than ever�, Chief Executive Amin Nasser told employees in a message, adding that full oil production would resume by the end of this month. The Sept. 14 attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais plants, some of the kingdom�s biggest, caused raging fires and significant damage that halved the crude output of the world�s top oil exporter, by shutting down 5.7 million barrels per day of production. �The fires that were intended to destroy Saudi Aramco had an unintended consequence: they galvanized 70,000 of us around a mission to rebound quickly and confidently, and Saudi Aramco has come out of this incident stronger than ever,� Nasser said in the internal message, on the occasion of the Saudi national day, to be celebrated on Sept. 23. �Every second counts in moments like these, and had we not acted quickly to contain the fires and undertake rapid restoration efforts, the impact on the oil market and the global economy would have been far more devastating.� Six days after the assault, which hit at the heart of the Saudi energy industry and intensified a decades-long struggle with arch-rival Iran, the state oil giant Aramco invited reporters on Friday to observe the damage and the repair efforts. Thousands of employees and contractors have been pulled from other projects to work around the clock to bring production back. Aramco is shipping equipment from the United States and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities, Aramco officials told reporters. Aramco already brought back part of the lost production and will return to pre-attacks level end of September, Nasser said. �Not a single shipment to our international customers has been missed or cancelled as a result of the attacks, and we will continue to fulfil our mission of providing the energy the world needs,� he said in the message, seen by Reuters.     Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had used its reserves to maintain oil supply flows to customers abroad and inside the kingdom. Yemen�s Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran. Tehran, which support the Houthis, has denied any involvement in the attacks. Saudi Arabia says 18 drones and three missiles were fired at Abqaiq, the world�s largest oil processing facility, while the Khurais facility was hit by four missiles.  No casualties were reported at either site even though thousands of workers and contractors work and live in the area.

About 120 Taiwanese information and communications technology firms are setting up operations in Bengaluru, an official said.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwan is pitching India as a potential business destination to its tech, auto, renewable energy and farm sector firms as the United States� trade war with China has pushed its companies to look for newer markets, two officials said on Friday. More than 10,000 Taiwanese companies, including Apple suppliers Foxconn and Wistron have massive operations in China, thanks to its tax incentives, organised supply chain and logistics, efficient business parks as well its cultural ties to the island. But a trade war between Washington and Beijing has led to higher tariffs on goods worth tens of billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, prompting companies to look at other countries to escape higher tariffs. �This trade war has encouraged more Taiwanese companies to figure out other options. So India and also other ASEAN countries are the alternative markets,� Shih-Chung Liu, vice chairman of Taiwan External Trade Development Council, told reporters. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional block comprising ten nations in Southeast Asia, which promotes economic, political and military ties between members. Beijing maintains that Taiwan, an island 110 miles (177 km) off the Chinese mainland, does not qualify for formal diplomatic ties with any country. And though India has no formal relation with Taiwan, Taipei runs an Economic and Cultural Center in capital New Delhi, which operates as a de facto embassy. Taiwanese firms are looking to invest in India�s technology, renewable energy, electric vehicle and farm sectors, Liu said. �India is among the most important markets, among those 18 new southbound policy countries.�. Taiwan�s southbound policy focuses on strengthening ties in the areas of culture, tourism, education and trade with 18 southeast and south Asian countries. It has opened four trade offices in India in the last few years and bilateral trade with Asia�s third-biggest economy stood at $7 billion in 2018. Trade between India and Taiwan will likely touch $10 billion over the next few years, said Chung-Kwang Tien, the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre. Helping that trade are about 120 Taiwanese information and communications technology firms, which are setting up operations in India�s southern technology hub Bengaluru, Tien said. �These companies have already put in $100 million,� he added.

564,Would rather be unicorn in revenue than m-cap: Infosys Co-founder,"Infosys Co-founder Nandan Nilekani, when asked about his views on the right way of building startup businesses, said that he is still a little ""old fashioned"". ""I would rather be a unicorn in revenue, than a unicorn in market cap, and I'd rather generate cash, than burn cash,"" he added. Nilekani has invested in over a dozen startups since 2014.",YourStory,"The euphoria around $1 billion valuations continues unabated in the startup world, but ask a seasoned business icon like Nandan Nilekani for his view on the right way of building businesses, and he says, rather matter-of-factly,Nandan, who is credited with building India�s digital infrastructure, is a well-known investor, who has backed over a dozen startups, including agritech startup NinjaCart, travel marketplace RailYatri, and startup research platform Tracxn, among others.Still, prod him further on whether he views his startup investments under the same lens, and he�s quick to admit that some business models do require a significant amount of cash burn. But even with such a business model, the ultimate goal should be to yield profits, he adds.Nandan, who began investing in startups in 2014, started the $100 million venture capital fund Fundamenteum with Helion Ventures Co-founder Sanjeev Aggarwal in 2017, with a view on making focused investments and helping them grow their business and scale.�In 2014, when I came back from doing Aadhar, I suddenly realised that there was a startup revolution happening in India, particularly in Bangalore and in Koramangala where I live. I was very keen to understand what was happening so I did a few investments, but then later I realised that I should do something more systematically,� Nandan says.Today, Fundamenteum prides itself on a partnership model that �isn�t limited to capital,� with the team offering active mentorship to entrepreneurs to build robust organisations.Going forward, Nandan says the focus will be to make investments in a select group of around 10 startups, so that, a few mentors, including Nandan himself, can work closely with each of these entrepreneurs to grow their companies.",https://yourstory.com/2019/09/nandan-nilekani-india-startups-investing-unicorn-business?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

566,Sex abuse case against former Sequoia Capital Partner dismissed,"A 2016 sexual abuse case against venture capitalist Michael Goguen, which led to his exit as a Partner from Sequoia Capital after nearly 20 years, has been dismissed. The plaintiff, Amber Baptiste, sought $40 million as compensation for the alleged abuse and sexual infection contracted from Goguen. Baptiste failed to undergo medical examinations and produce necessary documents.",TechCrunch,"Three-and-a-half years ago, a lawsuit hit the San Mateo, Calif. county courthouse that briefly attracted the attention of the worldwide venture capital community, given its salacious nature. The defendant: longtime VC Michael Goguen, who�d spent 20 years with Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. The plaintiff: Amber Baptiste, a former intimate who described him through the filing as a �worse predator than the human traffickers.� She said in the filing that she would know, having become a �victim of human trafficking� at age 15 when she was �brought to America in 2001,� then �sold as a dancer to a strip club� in Texas, which is where she says she first encountered Goguen.What she wanted from the lawsuit was money that she said was owed to her by Goguen: $40 million over four installments that the lawsuit stated was for �compensation for the sexual abuse and [a sexual] infection she contracted from him.� According to her suit, Goguen agreed to these terms, paying Baptiste a first installment of $10 million before refusing to make further payments.At the time, Goguen called the allegations �horrific� and suggested Baptiste was a spurned lover, saying they�d had a �10+ year romantic relationship that ended badly.� He also filed a cross-complaint alleging extortion.Today, that cross-complaint lives on, but Baptiste�s case against Goguen was just dismissed by arbitrator Read Ambler, a retired judge who served 20 years with the Santa Clara County Superior Court and who wrote in a ruling filed yesterday in San Mateo that Baptiste�s failures to undergo medical examinations doomed her case, as did her failure to produce documents necessary in the discovery process.�The record presented further establishes that Baptiste�s� failures were willful,� Ambler writes. �Baptiste appears to believe that the information responsive to the discovery at issue is either not relevant, or with respect to the medical examinations, not permitted by law. While Baptiste is free to believe what she wants to believe, the orders are binding on Baptiste, and her failure to comply with the orders is unacceptable.�Baptiste doesn�t currently have legal representation, though four sets of lawyers have represented her over time.Patricia Glaser, a high-powered attorney, originally took on Baptiste�s case (and later agreed to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein), but she asked to be relieved from the case five months later, citing �irreconcilable differences.� More recently, an LA-based couple that operates the Sherman Law Group filed a motion to be relieved as Baptiste�s counsel, citing �irreconcilable differences and a breakdown in communication.�Goguen�s attorneys say he will continue to pursue his counterclaims against Baptiste and looks forward to �complete vindication.�Though Ambler never remarked on the merits of Baptiste�s claims, Goguen�s attorney Diane Doolittle further said today in a statement that: �Amber Laurel Baptiste�s sensationalized lawsuit against Silicon Valley venture capitalist Michael Goguen  collapsed under the weight of its own falsehood yesterday, when a judge dismissed the case because of Baptiste�s repeated, egregious and willful misconduct. Over the course of this case, Baptiste perjured herself, concealed, destroyed and falsified key evidence, and demonstrated her contempt for the legal system by systematically violating numerous court orders.�Baptiste could not be reached for comment.Baptiste�s lawsuit against Goguen prompted Sequoia to part ways with him almost immediately. Later the very day that TechCrunch broke news of the suit in 2016, a Sequoia spokesman told us that while the firm understood �these allegations of serious improprieties� to be �unproven and unrelated to Sequoia� its management committee had nevertheless �decided that Mike�s departure was the appropriate course of action.�Goguen, who sold an $11 million home in Atherton, Calif., in 2017, has spent much of his time in recent years at another home in Whitefish, Mont., where he has seemingly been wooing locals.An August story about Goguen in The Missoulian about a separate case describes him as �known locally for philanthropic ventures.�The piece dutifully continues on to note that: �Such donations have funded Montana�s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and a Flathead group teaching girls to code. Two Bear Air, [Goguen�s] northwestern Montana search and rescue outfit free to anyone who has needed it, has performed well over 500 missions and 400 rescues, according to executive director and chief pilot Jim Pierce. Goguen has personally completed 30 rescues, the Daily Inter Lake reported in February. The Flathead Beacon reports he was honored with the Great Whitefish Award earlier this year.�",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/an-explosive-breach-of-contract-lawsuit-against-former-sequoia-capital-partner-michael-goguen-has-been-dropped/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

571,Prez accepts Madras HC Chief Justice Tahilramani's resignation,"Days after the Chief Justice of Madras High Court VK Tahilramani submitted her resignation after her transfer to the Meghalaya High Court, President Ram Nath Kovind accepted her resignation on Friday. Moreover, Justice Vineet Kothari, the senior-most judge of the Madras High Court, has been appointed as the acting Chief Justice of the court till further orders.",The News Minute,"Days after the Chief Justice of Madras High Court submitted her resignation after her controversial transfer to the Meghalaya High Court, President Ram Nath Kovind accepted her resignation on Friday. Justice Vineet Kothari, the senior-most judge of the Madras High Court, will be the acting Chief Justice of the Madras High Court till further orders.The Supreme Court collegium had, in the last week of August, recommended swapping the Chief Justices of two high courts in the country � the Madras High Court and the Meghalaya High Court. According to the decision of the collegium, Justice AK Mittal, the present Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court was to be posted as the Chief Justice of Madras High Court, while Justice VK Tahilramani was to take over AK Mittal�s post in Meghalaya.The decision had sent shockwaves within the fraternity. While it could have been construed as an advancement for Justice AK Mittal, since the Madras High Court is one of the oldest high courts in India and is the fourth largest one in the country in terms of number of judges, Justice VK Tahilramani was slated to head a court that was set up in 2013 with only three judges.Though Justice VK Tahilramani had requested the collegium to reconsider its decision, the collegium had refused to do so. Protesting the collegium�s decision, Justice Tahilramani submitted her resignation to the President of India and the Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi in the first week of September.Justice Tahilramani was sworn in as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court on August 12, 2018, after she was transferred from the Bombay High Court where she served as acting Chief Justice three times between 2015 and 2017.�Justice Tahilramani had presided over many important and controversial cases during her term in the Bombay High Court.

575,Saudi reveals damage caused by drone attacks on oil facilities,"Saudi Arabia on Friday took media on a tour of the oil facilities damaged by the recent drone attacks and showed melted pipes and burnt equipment. At Abqaiq, the world's largest oil processing plant, reporters saw a punctured and blackened stabilizer tower. ""We are working 24/7...This is a beehive,"" an official of state oil giant Aramco said.",Reuters,"ABQAIQ, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Friday took media on a tour of oil facilities damaged by attacks that Washington and Riyadh blame on Iran, showing melted pipes and burnt equipment, as Tehran vowed wide retaliation if heightened tensions boil over into hostilities. The kingdom sees the Sept. 14 strikes on its Khurais and Abqaiq facilities � the worst attack on Gulf oil infrastructure since Iraq�s Saddam Hussein torched Kuwaiti oilfields in 1991 � as a test of global will to preserve international order. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the United States was imposing sanctions on Iran�s central bank over the attack. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the bank was Tehran�s last source of funds. Asked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility. Iran denies involvement in the attack, which initially halved oil output from Saudi Arabia, the world�s largest petroleum exporter. Responsibility was claimed by Yemen�s Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen�s four-year-old conflict. At Abqaiq, one of the world�s largest oil processing plants, reporters saw a punctured, blackened stabilizer tower that Khalid Buraik, Saudi Aramco vice-president for southern area oil operations, said would have to be replaced. As reporters examined a shattered separator dome draped with a red tape labeled �Danger�, Buraik said 15 towers and facilities had been hit at Abqaiq, but it would regain full output capacity by the end of September. At Khurais oilfield to the west, which the Saudi defense ministry says was hit by four missiles, Reuters reporters were shown repair work under way, with cranes erected around two burnt-out stabilization columns, which form part of oil-gas separation units, and melted pipes.  �We are confident we are going back to the full production we were at before the attack (on Khurais) by the end of September,� Fahad Abdulkarim, Aramco�s general manager for the southern area oil operation, told reporters. �We are working 24/7...This is a beehive.�  Workmen wearing red high visibility jackets and white helmets moved through the site, a large compound the size of several football stadiums containing interconnected structures of piping and towers. A mound of blackened debris lay on the ground. An executive said the scorched mess once covered much of the surface of the facility but now only a small mound is left.  Some workers sprayed what appeared to be water on the ground. Mobile cranes and water trucks stood near the crumpled, mangled remains of a fire-damaged stabilization tower.  The Sept. 14 attacks intensified a years-long struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a sometimes violent contest for influence in several flashpoints around the Middle East. Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Thursday the attacks were an �extension of the Iranian regime�s hostile and outlawed behavior�. Iran has warned the United States against being dragged into a war in the Middle East and said it would meet any offensive action with a crushing response. Tehran amplified that message on Friday when a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said Iran would respond from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean against any U.S. plots. �If the Americans think of any plots, the Iranian nation will respond from the Mediterranean, to the Red Sea and to the Indian Ocean,� said General Yahya Rahim-Safavi, a senior adviser to Iran�s supreme leader, state news agency IRNA reported. Lebanon�s Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement warned Saudi Arabia against betting on a war against Iran �because they will destroy you,� its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said. �Your house is made of glass and your economy is made of glass. Like the glass cities in the UAE,� he said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had called the attacks an �act of war� but on Thursday he said Trump, who has ordered more sanctions on Iran, wants a peaceful solution to the crisis.  Iran�s foreign minister on Friday questioned Pompeo�s remarks and listed repeated Iranian diplomatic initiatives. �Coalition for Peaceful Resolution?,� Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter, and listed eight diplomatic initiatives by Iran since 1985, including a peace plan for Yemen in 2015. He later said Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates seemed to wish to �fight Iran to the last American�. Oil prices were on track for their biggest weekly jump since January, lifted by rising Middle East tensions after the attack. Brent crude was up more than 7% from last Friday�s close at $64.69 a barrel, U.S. West Texas Intermediate was $58.47. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Saudi King Salman in a phone call that China condemned the attack and called on all parties to avoid escalating the situation, Xinhua reported. Despite being a relatively low-profile diplomatic player in the Middle East, China has close economic and energy relations with both Saudi Arabia and Iran. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said groundless accusations against Iran over the attacks were inflaming tensions, Interfax news agency reported.

A Bengaluru-based chef, who visited Hampi, has been sent to judicial custody in connection with the incident.�The incident came to light after officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) noticed Nagaraj, a 45-year-old resident of Yelahanka in Bengaluru, near the pillars.�While Nagaraj maintains that he accidentally toppled the pillars while taking a selfie, officials informed security personnel who immediately nabbed Nagaraj and turned him over to the police.

""Everybody has a shelf life. He should be going without being pushed out. He should be going on his own terms,"" Gavaskar added. ""He's 38 and will be 39-plus during next T20 World Cup. I think India should be looking ahead,"" he said.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - The time has come for India�s long-serving wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni to bow out of international cricket - and he should go before he�s pushed, batting great Sunil Gavaskar said. Former captain Dhoni has been the subject of intense speculation among fans, ex-players and pundits over when he will retire from international cricket since India�s semi-final exit from the World Cup. The veteran of 350 one-dayers, who quit playing tests at the end of 2014, has not provided any hint of what his plans are.  However he made himself unavailable for India�s tour of the West Indies and instead opted to spend 15 days with India�s territorial army, a reservist force that draws on civilians who can do short stints to assist the military. Dhoni was also a notable omission from India�s Twenty20 squad for the ongoing three-match series against South Africa. �Nobody knows what�s in MSD�s mind. Only he can clarify what he thinks his future with Indian cricket is,� former India captain and opening batsman Gavaskar told India Today.  �But he�s now 38, by the time the next T20 World Cup comes he will be over 39 years old. I think India should be looking ahead.� Dhoni captained India to the World Twenty20 crown in 2007, and the 50-over World Cup title at home four years later, and enjoys cult status in the cricket-mad country. At his prime Dhoni was widely considered the best �finisher� in the game but his electrifying ability to put bowlers to the sword to the end of innings has waned of late, while he has also struggled to make solid starts. Dhoni�s glovework, however, still remains top class. The next 50-over World Cup is still four years away but the World Twenty20 will be held in 2020 and Dhoni enjoys unwavering support from India captain Virat Kohli who has publicly backed him on numerous occasions. �His value to the side is always going to be fantastic.

591,I had given up on cricket after 2007 World Cup snub: Gautam Gambhir,"Ex-India opener Gautam Gambhir has said he had given up on cricket after he wasn't selected in India squad for 2007 World Cup. ""Before that, I had missed both U-14 and U-19 World Cups. In 2007 I thought I was the closest to play the World Cup,"" he added. He further called it the ""lowest moment"" in his cricketing career.",CricTracker,"Gautam Gambhir retired from all forms of cricket back in December 2018 after representing Delhi in one of the matches in the Ranji Trophy at the Feroz Shah Kotla. Albeit he wasn�t a regular member of the national team in the last few years, he would still be remembered as someone, who played two match-winning knocks in the final of the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 World Cup.However, the retirement could�ve come way back in 2007. The southpaw made his ODI debut back in 2003, but couldn�t make the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. The Delhi-born was around 25 years old at that time and the rejection got to him, so much so that he wished to bid adieu to the sport.Advertisement�In 2007, when I missed the 50-over World Cup, that was the lowest moment in my cricketing career. I had given up on cricket. Before that, I had missed both U-14 and U-19 World Cups. In 2007 I thought I was the closest to play the World Cup, but when they did not include me in the squad, I had given up on cricket,� Gambhir was quoted as saying in India Today.Just when Gambhir felt down and out, he was in for a surprise. The left-hander was picked in the Indian squad for the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa. He didn�t make a great start and got out for a duck to Mohammad Asif in the first match against Pakistan at the Kingsmead in Durban.But the rub of the green went his way and he ended the tournament as the leading run-scorer. India defeated Pakistan in the final at the Wanderers in Johannesburg and Gambhir churned out a masterful 75 off 54, though he didn�t get the Man of the Match.�Then I was chosen in Twenty-20 World Cup in 2007 and I got dismissed for a duck in the first match against Pakistan. But as fate has it, I finished as the leading run-scorer in the World Cup and we ended up winning the tournament so one should never give up,� the veteran added.From thereon, Gambhir didn�t look back and made a name for himself in all three formats. With 20 centuries and 63 half-centuries, Gautam was one of the most reliable batters at the top of the order. He was once also the ICC�s number one Test batsman back in 2009.",https://www.crictracker.com/had-given-up-on-cricket-gautam-gambhir-after-2007-world-cup-snub/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Patients share their prescription with Digi-Prex through WhatsApp and the startup�s workers then deliver the medication to them on a recurring cycle.Delivery is not the only thing Digi-Prex is trying to provide. It helps patients better track when they need a new supply of medicine, and checks if they are seeing improvements. The startup has amassed thousands of customers in Hyderabad, Samarth Sindhi, founder of Digi-Prex, told TechCrunch in an interview.Digi-Prex just closed its seed round from a range of highly-influential VC firms. It�s also one of the largest seed financing rounds for an Indian startup.The startup has raised $5.5 million from Khosla Ventures,  Vedanta Capital, Y Combinator, Quiet Capital, and SV Angel.

The startup shares some margin with physicians and pharmacies, but more importantly, it says this arrangement works for everyone because it is able to serve customers who are living at distant neighborhoods.Digi-Prex works directly with medicine distributors to secure supplies at lower costs. It then undercuts the pricing of over-the-top counters, providing medicines to its customers at discounted rates.Sindhi said the startup will use the fresh capital to expand its business to 10 cities in India, and find ways to be more useful to the patients. Some of the things that Digi-Prex is working on includes providing patients with access to better physicians and offering them more information about their disease.It�s not surprising why Digi-Prex is using WhatsApp as a distribution platform. �When I returned to India, I was fascinated by how nobody was texting anymore. Everyone was doing everything on WhatsApp,� he said.WhatsApp, which is already the most popular app in India, is increasingly finding business applications in the country.

613,Millions protest across the world demanding action on climate change,"Millions of people joined protests across the world on Friday to demand global leaders to act against climate change. The global climate strike is being led by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Students from several schools joined protests throughout the day in Mumbai, with thousands of events having been planned in more than 130 countries.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Millions of young people flooded the streets of cities around the world on Friday to demand political leaders take urgent steps to stop climate change, uniting in a worldwide protest inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Alarmed by images of the Greenland ice sheets melting and the Amazon rain forests burning, students and workers abandoned schools, shops and offices in nearly every corner of the globe, aiming to stop what they see as a looming environmental catastrophe. The protests started in the Pacific islands, where rising sea levels threaten a way of life, and followed the sun across Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and on to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. The coordinated student �strike� culminated in New York�s Wall Street, where some investors have embraced the fossil fuel industry. Massive crowds overwhelmed the streets of lower Manhattan, chanting �Save our planet!� while anticipating an address by Thunberg, an international figure who sailed across the Atlantic in an emissions-free yacht ahead of next week�s climate summit at the United Nations. �Right now we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action, then we will,� Thunberg told tens of thousands of people gathered at a park with a view of the Statue of Liberty. Once she took the stage, the crowd chanted her name, then went silent to hang on her every word. As she paused between sentences, people erupted into applause. �If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you. Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not,� she concluded. Demonstrators in Paris raised a painting of Thunberg as the Virgin Mary, a halo around her head reading, �Our house is on fire.�    �She�s like the icon of our generation,� New York protester Fiamma Cochrane, 17, said, highlighting the leadership role of young people in the international movement to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. Four million people participated worldwide including 300,000 in New York, organizers with the anti-fossil fuels group 350.org said. Reuters could not verify the crowd sizes. Concern has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the international Paris Accord on climate change and took a series of steps to dismantle environmental protections, including moving on Thursday to block stricter vehicle emissions standards in California. Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are among the world�s only national leaders who publicly question the science of climate change, and they are not taking part in next week�s U.N. climate summit. Thousands gathered across Brazil to take aim at Bolsonaro, who they say is allowing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest to clear space for soy beans and cattle ranching. In August, fires there surged to their greatest level since 2010.  �The policy of the Bolsonaro government is the policy of environmental destruction and deepening the climate crisis ... this is why we�re on strike,� said Marcela Pimentel Miranda, an organizer for Youth for Climate�s affiliate in Brasilia. One protester in Sao Paulo held up a picture of Bolsonaro and Trump beneath the hand-written �Abolish fossil fools!�  Demonstrators in Thailand stormed the environment ministry and feigned death, while activists in Berlin and Munich stood on  melting blocks of ice with nooses around their necks to symbolize the earth�s fate when the polar ice caps melt.     Protesters in Warsaw staged a performance of people drowning in a sea of plastic waste. �The planet is getting hotter than my imaginary boyfriend,� read a poster held by a teenager in Thailand. �Make love, not CO2� signs were spotted in Berlin and Vienna. While Europeans filled the streets, students in the Solomon Islands gathered at the rising ocean water�s edge wearing traditional grass skirts. The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels. Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, according to scientists. �There is no Planet B,� read a sign hoisted by a young woman in London. In Kenya, around 500 activists marched to demand that the government cancel plans for a coal plant and investigate corruption in hydropower dams. �In Samburu there is a lot of heat, the grass has dried up, there is little water,� said Francis Lentel, a young herdsman in traditional beads, holding a picture of the Earth weeping. The protest movement is putting increasing pressure on governments and companies to respond.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a new climate protection package thrashed out by parties in her coalition during all-night talks. Private industry has also responded. Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos on Thursday pledged to make the largest U.S. e-commerce company net carbon neutral by 2040. Hundreds of workers from Google, Amazon and other technology companies on Friday criticized their industry for being slow to tackle climate change and joined marches in San Francisco and Seattle calling for action.

615,China lured it with planes: Taiwan as Kiribati switches ties to China,Taiwan has said that China offered airplanes and ferries to lure the Pacific island nation of Kiribati after it severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in order to establish relations with China. Kiribati's decision came only four days after the Solomon Islands cut ties with Taiwan in favour of China. Only 15 countries now have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.,Reuters,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - China offered airplanes and ferries to lure the Pacific island nation of Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations, Taiwan said on Friday, as the self-ruled island lost a second ally to Chinese pressure in less than a week. The switch, just days after the Solomon Islands cut ties, deals a fresh blow to President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January, as it takes to seven the tally of allies lost to China since she took office in 2016. Taiwan has terminated diplomatic ties with Kiribati and will immediately shut its embassy there, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters. �According to information obtained by Taiwan, the Chinese government has already promised to provide full funds for the procurement of several airplanes and commercial ferries, thus luring Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations,� he added. China was trying to �suppress and reduce Taiwan�s international presence� and �ultimately destroy Taiwan�s sovereignty,� Wu said. �It is blatantly obvious that the Chinese government, by creating these diplomatic incidents, seeks to manipulate public opinion in Taiwan, influence Taiwan�s upcoming presidential and legislative elections, and undermine its democratic processes.� The Kiribati president�s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China �highly appreciated� Kiribati�s decision to re-establish ties with Beijing, severed in 2003 when Tarawa recognised Taipei. Asked how much money China was offering Kiribati, Geng said principles and trust could not be bought but added that Kiribati would have �unprecedented development opportunities� with China by its side. China claims Taiwan as its territory, and says the democratic island has no right to formal ties with any country. Friday�s switch leaves Taiwan with formal relations to just 15 countries.  �They have chosen to give up a sincere friend and become a chess piece for China. We think it�s a huge mistake,� Tsai told reporters, warning of more �Chinese intimidation� ahead of the vote in January.  �They have one single goal - to reverse the presidential campaign. They are trying to tell Taiwanese that we can�t buy jets, we can�t support Hong Kong and that we can only elect a president who bows to pressure from China.� Since Tsai took office, China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan, by flying regular bomber patrols around the island, for example. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan�s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Aid requested by Kiribati from Beijing includes loans and a Boeing 737 aircraft, said a senior official in Taiwan with direct knowledge of the matter who sought anonymity. Citing intelligence gathered by Taipei, the source said China aimed to peel away more of Taiwan�s allies before the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1. �That worries several countries in the region, including the United States and Australia,� said the official, citing fears over China�s growing influence in the Pacific.  Kiribati is the seventh country to drop Taiwan as a diplomatic ally since 2016, following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, El Salvador and the Solomon Islands. Taiwan�s main opposition, the China-friendly Kuomintang party, urged Tsai�s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to review its policy towards Beijing.  �The DPP should examine the real cause behind the breaking of ties and propose a practical solution,� it said in a statement. �It should not continue to shift the responsibility to the former ally, the mainland authorities or the opposition party.�   A spokesman for Taiwan�s presidential office said, �With the breaking of ties, China is forcing Taiwan to accept �one country two systems,�� referring to an arrangement that guarantees certain freedoms to the Chinese-ruled city of Hong Kong.    �The more Taiwan shows that it�s not being intimidated, the more it frustrates China�s scheme,� added the spokesman, Yun-kung Ting.

They are not there to see you bowl a maiden over and that�s what it�s all about,� he said.Shamsi�s stint at RCB has helped him grow as a cricketer with the likes of Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle offering him useful tips.�Definitely, it helps when you are around speaking to world-class players like Virat, Gayle and Shane Watson. The world of cricket is shrinking in the sense that everyone is ready to share knowledge,� he said. �You will find senior South African fast bowlers imparting knowledge to Indian fast bowlers and vice-versa. Being familiar with surroundings while playing for RCB will certainly help.�Over the years, South Africa had Imran Tahir at their disposal but with the legspinner not around, Shamsi has a golden opportunity to lay a strong case for himself and cement a place as his team�s premier wristspinner.�I don�t see this as an additional responsibility. When Immy was there in the team, my job was to do what�s best for the team and obviously with him not being there, I am the only wrist spinner in the team. But I have not shied away from challenges and India is another one of those,� he said.�Being a legspinner myself, I know guys tend to help each other out as it�s a small club and we know how tough our art is. I found spending a lot of time with Tahir but I have found all the leg-spinners in the other teams easy-going.�In terms of idols, Shamsi draws inspiration from Australia chinaman bowler Brad Hogg.�Hogg, I used to watch his bowling a lot during my growing up years. He was the only left-arm wrist spinner playing the game then. But if you see knowledge is everywhere and you just have to be open-minded and to be able to pick things that works for you and leave things that don�t work for you,� Shamsi said.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/bowlers-like-me-spoil-the-party-for-batsmen-in-t20s-tabraiz-shamsi-893587?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

621,Twitter tests 'Hide Replies' feature in US and Japan,"Twitter has announced it is testing the 'Hide Replies' feature in the US and Japan, after initially testing the same in Canada. The feature lets a Twitter user hide any reply to their tweet, which they deem irrelevant, abusive or offensive. Hidden replies can be seen by the users who choose to click on a dedicated icon to view them.",TechCrunch,"Twitter�s  controversial �Hide Replies� feature, aimed at civilizing conversations on its platform, is launching today in the U.S. and Japan after earlier tests in Canada. The addition is one of the more radical changes to Twitter to date. It puts people back in control of a conversation they�ve started by giving them the ability to hide those contributions they think are unworthy.These replies, which may range from the irrelevant to the outright offensive, aren�t actually deleted from Twitter. They�re just put behind an extra click.That means people who come into a conversation to cause drama, make inappropriate remarks or bully and abuse others won�t have their voices heard by the majority of the conversation�s participants. Only those who choose to view the hidden replies will see those posts.Other social media platforms don�t give so much power to commenters to disrupt conversations. On Facebook and Instagram, for example, you can delete any replies to your own posts.But Twitter has a different vibe. It�s meant to be a public town square, where everyone has a right to speak (within reason.)Unfortunately, Twitter�s open nature also led to bullying and abuse. Before today, the only options Twitter offered were to mute, block and report users. Blocking and muting, however, only impact your own Twitter experience. You may no longer see posts from those users, but others still could. Reporting a tweet is also a complicated process that takes time. It�s not an immediate solution for a conversation rapidly spinning out of control.While �Hide Replies� will help address these problems, it ships with challenges of its own, too. It could be used as a way to silence dissenting opinions, including those expressed thoughtfully, or even fact-checked clarifications.Twitter believes the feature will ultimately encourage people to better behave when posting to its platform.�We already see people trying to keep their conversations healthy by using block, mute, and report, but these tools don�t always address the issue. Block and mute only change the experience of the blocker, and report only works for the content that violates our policies,��explained Twitter�s PM of Health Michelle Yasmeen Haq�earlier this year.Since launching in Canada in July, Twitter said that people mostly used the feature to hide replies they found were irrelevant, abusive or unintelligible. User feedback was positive, as well, as those who used the tool said they found it was a helpful way to control what they saw, similar to keyword muting.In a survey, 27% of those who had their tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future, Twitter said. That�s not a large majority, but it�s enough to make a dent. However, it�s unclear how representative this survey was. Twitter declined to say how many people used the feature or how many were surveyed about its impacts.The system will now also ask users who hide replies if they also want to block the account, as a means of clarifying that �hiding� is a different function.�These are positive and heartening results: the feature helped people have better conversations, and was a useful tool against replies that deterred from the person�s original intent,� explained Twitter in a blog post, shared today. �We�re interested to see if these trends continue, and if new ones emerge, as we expand our test to Japan and the U.S. People in these markets use Twitter in many unique ways, and we�re excited to see how they might use this new tool,� the post read.Despite the expansion, Twitter says �Hide Replies� is still considered a test as the company is continuing to evaluate the system, and it�s not available to Twitter�s global user base.The new feature will start rolling out at 2 PM PT in both the U.S. and Japan and will be available across mobile and web clients.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/twitter-launches-its-controversial-hide-replies-feature-in-the-u-s-and-japan/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

634,I'll pledge every square inch of my body: Rahul Bose on organ donation,"Actor Rahul Bose has said he'll soon be signing up for deceased organ donation and would be pledging ""every square inch"" of his body for donation after death.

Bose, in a conversation with IANS, made the announcement and said that he is happy to ""pledge everything"" from bone, tissue, cornea, and every single part human beings can benefit from. ""I'll pledge every square inch of my body,"" said the 52-year-old actor.

The Japanese Wife�actor is a panelist at an upcoming discussion organised by CII's Indian Women Network and Yi (Young Indians) Delhi Chapters on September 24 in New Delhi. According to Bose, he will be formally signing up for donation of his organs on the date.

He already supports the causes of equalizing development through children's education and preventing child sexual abuse through his foundations.

""It's very simple for me, I take any way by which I can help human beings lead a better life... I've dedicated the last 14 years of my life to these causes and supporting many other causes in a smaller way. So, if I can help other human beings (by donating organs), why wouldn't I?""

""If you're going to die, (and post that) if your body can be used to benefit 8-9 other human beings in terms of organs, what would be greater good karma.""

The event, happening in partnership with MOHAN (Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network) Foundation is backed by industry and commerce body CII, which gives the actor some hope about the mainstreaming of organ donation in India. ""It's so unpopular right now... In India, there's one organ donor per 1 million people, whereas in Spain, there are 49 per 10 lakh people.""

Does he encourage more and more people to donate their organs? ""I would encourage other people to find out more about it, allay their fears, superstitions and irrational beliefs.

637,US sanctions-hit Huawei launches phone without Google apps,"Chinese smartphone maker Huawei has launched its latest high-end smartphone without American technology giant Google's apps pre-installed on it. This comes over the US' move to put Huawei under its 'Entity List', restricting it from carrying out any business with US firms. ""Today because of the US ban we can't pre-install Google's applications,"" Huawei's consumer business group head said.",Times Now,"Chinese tech giant Huawei launched its latest high-end smartphone in Munich on Thursday, the first of its mobile devices not to carry popular Google apps because of US sanctions.""Today because of the US ban we cannot pre-install"" Google's applications, said Richard Yu, who heads Huawei's consumer business group, as he unveiled the group's latest Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro models.But heading off fears that a phone without popular apps like Whatsapp, YouTube or Google Maps could not succeed, he stressed that the equivalent platform by the Chinese giant offered a choice of 45,000 apps through the Huawei App Gallery.Yu added that the Chinese giant was investing US$1 billion (900,000 euros) into its Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) core software ecosystem, as he urged app developers to bring their creations to the system.Huawei, targeted directly by the United States as part of a broader trade conflict with Beijing, was added to a ""blacklist"" in Washington in May.Since then, it has been illegal for American firms to do business with the Chinese firm, suspected of espionage by President Donald Trump and his administration.As a result, the new Mate will run on a freely available version of Android, the world's most-used phone operating system that is owned by the search engine heavyweight.While Mate 30 owners will experience little difference in the use of the operating system, the lack of Google's Play Store -- which provides access to hundreds of thousands of third-party apps and games as well as films, books and music -- could be unsettling.Household-name services like WhatsApp, Instagram and Google Maps will be unavailable.The tech press reports that this yawning gap in functionality has left some sellers reluctant to stock the new phones, fearing a wave of rapid-fire returns from dissatisfied customers.With the trade conflict with the US unlikely to be resolved imminently, Huawei has little choice but to ramp up the development of its own ""ecosystem"" of devices, apps and services that would bind-users more closely to it.The world's second-largest smartphone maker after Samsung, Huawei earlier this month presented its proprietary operating system HarmonyOS, a potential replacement for Android.The Mate 30 will not yet have HarmonyOS installed.But it could make for a new round in the decades-old ""OS wars"" between Microsoft's Windows and Apple's Mac OS, then Android versus Apple's iOS.Meanwhile, Eric Xu, current holder of Huawei's rotating chief executive chair, has urged Europe to foster an alternative to Google and Apple.That could provide an opening for Huawei to build up Europe's market of 500 million well-off consumers as a stronghold against American rivals.""If Europe had its own ecosystem for smart devices, Huawei would use it... that would resolve the problem of European digital dependency"" on the United States, Xu told German business daily Handelsblatt.He added that his company would be prepared to invest in developing such joint European-Chinese projects.",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/huawei-launches-first-sanctions-hit-phone-without-google-apps/491899?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

638,Elon Musk-backed startup Stripe to get $250 mn at $35 bn valuation,"US digital payments startup Stripe is raising $250 million in funding at a pre-money valuation of $35 billion, a 56% surge from its previous valuation. The round saw participation from investors including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst. Founded in 2010, Stripe is backed by investors including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Google's venture arm CapitalG, among others.",TechCrunch,"After a week of launching new services to bring payments giant Stripe into the areas of lending and credit, the company is announcing another big step forward to fuel its growth: it�s raising another $250 million in funding at a pre-money valuation of $35 billion, money to fuel more international expansion, launching more products and targeting larger enterprise-sized businesses.This is a huge jump in valuation for the company: Stripe  was valued at $22.5 billion earlier this year when it raised $100 million.The startup said that General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia are all in the round already. We�ve also heard that SoftBank had been considering an investment. �It was a big miss when SoftBank didn�t invest two years ago,� one source close to the VC said to TechCrunch. But we�ve confirmed also with John Collison � the president of Stripe who co-founded the company with his brother Patrick (who is the CEO) � that SoftBank is not in this round.Nor will there be any corporate strategics involved in this round. Of note, Collison today confirmed that the bank providing the financial backing for its new cash advance and corporate card services is Celtic Bank, based in Salt Lake City. But the bank is not taking a strategic investment in the company as part of that deal.Although the round is not yet closed, Collison said the $250 million size is unlikely to change. The round should close in the next several weeks, he added.Stripe has long been reluctant to talk about when it might consider going public, and this round will put that prospect off even further. �We are still very happy as a private company,� Collison said today. �Our emphasis remans on the long-term opportunities.�Stripe spent the first several years of its life slowly building up its payments business � which primarily consisted of providing an API to e-commerce businesses so that they could easily integrate a payments option in their apps or websites. But in more recent years, it�s started to accelerate its growth with a significantly larger range of financial services � notably, now it describes its business as a �Global Payments and Treasury Network.� The latest products � cash advances and credit cards � are coming on the heels of other services that include incorporation services, fraud protection and and more. All this means not only that the company can diversify its own revenues, but it can differentiate itself from (or, in some cases, offer the same services as) its competitors. Others offering similar services to Stripe�s include PayPal and Adyen on the payments front, but as it adds more services, it�s also opening new competitive fronts with other rivals, now including Square, Brex and Clearbanc.While the U.S. remains Stripe�s main market, especially for new launches, it�s getting increasingly global. The company last week expanded its payments out to eight more countries and that is set to expand again to total 40 in the coming months.�The company says it processes �hundreds of billions of dollars a year for millions of businesses worldwide,� although it declines to give specific numbers. Wayfair, Airbnb, Twilio, GitHub and The RealReal are among the kind of �enterprise� customers that it hopes to target more. Indeed, as startups in e-commerce grow into huge businesses, they are turning from being the kinds of small companies that Stripe used to target into the big companies that it now wants to target.�This comes in the context of the fact�that we feel strongly about Stripe�s role in the growing internet economy,� Collison said.�As we have pointed out before, the internet economy, for all its seeming ubiquity, is still a small part of all commerce, which is one reason brick and mortar is likely to be another target for Stripe in the long run, building on the point-of-sale services it already provides � even as the company continues to reap the rewards of its traction in the digital universe.�Even now, in 2019, less than eight percent of commerce happens online,� said John Collison, president and co-founder of Stripe, in a statement announcing the round. �We�re investing now to build the infrastructure that�ll power internet commerce in 2030 and beyond. If we get it right, we can help the internet fulfill its potential as an engine for global economic progress.�Updated with comments from John Collison, the co-founder of Stripe",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/stripe-is-raising-another-250m-at-a-35b-pre-money-valuation/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

GlowRoad Co-founder Shekhar Sahu responded saying that they will ""strongly reply"" to the legal notices sent by Meesho.",Entrackr,"Competition is an integral part of startups, and it separates great companies from the ordinary. Sometimes cut-throat competition and aspiration for scale also force entrepreneurs to compromise with ethics. The Indian startup ecosystem has witnessed the ugly fight between several direct competitors, including OYO-Zo Rooms and Meru-Uber.OYO had levelled data theft allegation on Zo Rooms and dragged the Tiger Global-backed firm in the court. Making similar allegations, Meesho has slapped legal notices to nine ex-employees for joining its competitor GlowRoad.The notices alleged that ex-employees had stolen confidential data and GlowRoad had actively poached these employees to utilise the data to their benefit. The Facebook-funded company also initiated a case against GlowRoad and nine of its ex-employees in Bangalore civil court.�In a blogpost, Meesho claims that GlowRoad has been engaged in unlawful and unethical business practices, methodically poaching employees and accessing the data that was generated by the company.

The UN emitted 1.86 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017, according to its own data.",Reuters,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Close to 2,000 United Nations employees have called for the global body to reduce its carbon footprint, including through curbs on their own diplomatic perks like business-class flights and travel handouts, a letter obtained by Reuters showed. The United Nations calls climate change the �defining issue of our time� and is hosting a New York summit on it next week. But reformers within say in the letter addressed to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that it needs more radical change to get its own house in order. �Our commitments need to be more ambitious and at least as concrete as those of the UN Member States and non-party stakeholders attending the UN Climate Action Summit,� said the letter, signed by at least 1,950 employees. It was organized by a group called Young UN, an internal network committed to ensuring the organization embodies the principles it stands for. �As Greta Thunberg just sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and young people across the world continue to strike every Friday, let us look at our own impact and take bold steps to address the climate emergency,� the letter said, referring to the Swedish teenager who has inspired global climate strikes. The United Nations emitted 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018, according to its own data which includes both the 44,000 secretariat staff present in more than 60 countries as well as tens of thousands of interns, contractors and peacekeeping troops deployed worldwide.  That equates to a carbon footprint larger than several of its member states, including Malta and Liberia, according to statistics from the Global Carbon Atlas for 2017. Among 10 issues identified by Young UN are travel allowances, which the letter said needed to be cut or scrapped �in order to disincentivize travel by UN employees and UN meeting participants motivated by financial gain�. Allowances, or per diems as they are known internally, are intended to cover travel costs including food and accommodation, and can exceed $400 a day for some locations such as New York, according to the International Civil Service Commission website. The letter also suggested that staff should be rewarded for downgrading from business class, where a spacious seat generates several times the emissions of an economy class ticket.  Travel accounts for nearly half the United Nations� emissions, its data show. Last year, under pressure from member states, the head of the U.N. Environment Programme, Erik Solheim, stepped down amid criticism of his travels. Other reforms recommended in the letter include a complete divestment of the more than $60 billion U.N. pension fund from fossil fuels and creating offices run entirely on renewable energy. Young UN did not respond to requests for comment. Guterres is seeking to combat climate change from within in order to boost sustainability. �The Secretary-General welcomes the initiative of Young UN on climate action in the UN system,� Guterres� office said in a statement to Reuters on Friday. �The Secretary-General is committed to lead by example and calls for transformative action to address the climate crisis, including on the part of the UN system and Secretariat itself,� it continued. The employees� letter welcomed Guterres� internal strategy but said it �misses the urgency of the crisis we are facing�.  The United Nations has also launched a �Greening the Blue� initiative which measures the U.N. system�s greenhouse gas emissions, waste disposal, fresh-water use, and environmental management. According to its latest report issued on Friday, 55 of its entities, or 95 percent, including the Secretariat, were climate neutral in 2018, against just over a third the previous year. But the letter raises doubts about U.N. offset mechanisms, a method that works through purchases of U.N.-certified carbon credits from approved green projects and is widely used by organizations and businesses to tout their green credentials.  This echoes criticism from NGOs about the contribution of offsets to sustainable development. Isabella Marras, Sustainable UN Coordinator, whose team produces the Greening the Blue report and was a signatory to the letter, said she saw scope for the United Nations to give even greater attention to environmental considerations. �What we are missing is the aggressive integration of environmental issues into our programs like the UN has done for women,� she told Reuters. But she stressed some of the pragmatic challenges in regions where environmental standards are less strong than in Western countries. Marie-Claire Graf, a 23-year-old Swiss climate activist visiting the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva, said the number of U.N. vehicles in vast carparks overlooking the lake and mountains was surprising. �The UN is doing some amazing things on environment but I am shocked by so many SUVs and the amount of travel,� said Graf, who was selected along with 100 young climate leaders to attend the U.N. Youth Climate Summit on 21 September. �The UN needs to lead on this transformation.� Additional reporting by Maggie Fick in Nairobi; Editing by Stephanie Nebehay, Catherine Evans and Mark Potter",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-un-document/u-n-urged-by-own-staff-to-look-at-its-climate-footprint-idUSKBN1W50YH?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The heavy rains have prompted the Governor of Texas Greg Abbott to declare an emergency in several parts of the state. However, volunteers of the event said, ""We are going to have a fantastic programme.""",ANI,"Texas [US], Sept 20 (ANI): Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much-anticipated address at 'Howdy Modi' event, a tropical storm has triggered relentless and heavy rains in Texas leading to flash flooding in some parts of the state.Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster in 13 counties impacted by remnants of tropical storm Imelda.National Weather Service is calling Imelda a ""particularly dangerous situation,"" and urging residents to ""seek higher ground now!"". Rain may continue into Friday in parts of eastern Texas and western Louisiana.Hundred of flights were cancelled into and out of Houston area airport due to severe rain.Imelda dropped enough rain in one day at Houston's Intercontinental Airport to set a record for the wettest 24-hour period in September, breaking Hurricane Ike's record set on September 13, 2008. However, flight operations for arrivals will resume at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) on Friday, as per airport authorities. ""Flight arrivals will resume at 4 am CT tomorrow. Please check with your airline on flight status before coming to the airport. While driving to the airport will be closed until Noon. All other checkpoints will be open.

647,US says it is building a coalition after attacks on Saudi oil facilities,"After accusing Iran of drone attacks on two Saudi oil facilities, US State Secretary Mike Pompeo has said the country was building a coalition ""aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution"". Iran has warned US President Donald Trump against being dragged into a war in Middle East and said it would meet any offensive action with a crushing response.",Reuters,"ABQAIQ, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Friday took media on a tour of oil facilities damaged by attacks that Washington and Riyadh blame on Iran, showing melted pipes and burnt equipment, as Tehran vowed wide retaliation if heightened tensions boil over into hostilities. The kingdom sees the Sept. 14 strikes on its Khurais and Abqaiq facilities � the worst attack on Gulf oil infrastructure since Iraq�s Saddam Hussein torched Kuwaiti oilfields in 1991 � as a test of global will to preserve international order. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the United States was imposing sanctions on Iran�s central bank over the attack. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the bank was Tehran�s last source of funds. Asked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility. Iran denies involvement in the attack, which initially halved oil output from Saudi Arabia, the world�s largest petroleum exporter. Responsibility was claimed by Yemen�s Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen�s four-year-old conflict. At Abqaiq, one of the world�s largest oil processing plants, reporters saw a punctured, blackened stabilizer tower that Khalid Buraik, Saudi Aramco vice-president for southern area oil operations, said would have to be replaced. As reporters examined a shattered separator dome draped with a red tape labeled �Danger�, Buraik said 15 towers and facilities had been hit at Abqaiq, but it would regain full output capacity by the end of September. At Khurais oilfield to the west, which the Saudi defense ministry says was hit by four missiles, Reuters reporters were shown repair work under way, with cranes erected around two burnt-out stabilization columns, which form part of oil-gas separation units, and melted pipes.  �We are confident we are going back to the full production we were at before the attack (on Khurais) by the end of September,� Fahad Abdulkarim, Aramco�s general manager for the southern area oil operation, told reporters. �We are working 24/7...This is a beehive.�  Workmen wearing red high visibility jackets and white helmets moved through the site, a large compound the size of several football stadiums containing interconnected structures of piping and towers. A mound of blackened debris lay on the ground. An executive said the scorched mess once covered much of the surface of the facility but now only a small mound is left.  Some workers sprayed what appeared to be water on the ground. Mobile cranes and water trucks stood near the crumpled, mangled remains of a fire-damaged stabilization tower.  The Sept. 14 attacks intensified a years-long struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a sometimes violent contest for influence in several flashpoints around the Middle East. Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Thursday the attacks were an �extension of the Iranian regime�s hostile and outlawed behavior�. Iran has warned the United States against being dragged into a war in the Middle East and said it would meet any offensive action with a crushing response. Tehran amplified that message on Friday when a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said Iran would respond from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean against any U.S. plots. �If the Americans think of any plots, the Iranian nation will respond from the Mediterranean, to the Red Sea and to the Indian Ocean,� said General Yahya Rahim-Safavi, a senior adviser to Iran�s supreme leader, state news agency IRNA reported. Lebanon�s Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement warned Saudi Arabia against betting on a war against Iran �because they will destroy you,� its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said. �Your house is made of glass and your economy is made of glass. Like the glass cities in the UAE,� he said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had called the attacks an �act of war� but on Thursday he said Trump, who has ordered more sanctions on Iran, wants a peaceful solution to the crisis.  Iran�s foreign minister on Friday questioned Pompeo�s remarks and listed repeated Iranian diplomatic initiatives. �Coalition for Peaceful Resolution?,� Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter, and listed eight diplomatic initiatives by Iran since 1985, including a peace plan for Yemen in 2015. He later said Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates seemed to wish to �fight Iran to the last American�. Oil prices were on track for their biggest weekly jump since January, lifted by rising Middle East tensions after the attack. Brent crude was up more than 7% from last Friday�s close at $64.69 a barrel, U.S. West Texas Intermediate was $58.47. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Saudi King Salman in a phone call that China condemned the attack and called on all parties to avoid escalating the situation, Xinhua reported. Despite being a relatively low-profile diplomatic player in the Middle East, China has close economic and energy relations with both Saudi Arabia and Iran. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said groundless accusations against Iran over the attacks were inflaming tensions, Interfax news agency reported.

648,"Condom sales in Argentina fall amid recession, falling currency","Condom sales in recession-hit Argentina have fallen by 25% over recent months amid rising inflation and currency devaluation. Because of a weaker currency, condom prices have risen 36% since the start of the year as raw materials are imported, a manufacturer said. The peso currency has lost over 65% of its value against the dollar since the start of 2018.",Reuters,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In South America�s capital of romance, Argentine lovers are cutting back on one important cost: contraception. Amid a biting recession, a sharp currency devaluation and painful inflation, sales of condoms and birth control pills have tumbled, pharmacists and manufacturers say. �The devaluation of the peso is killing me,� actor and comic Guillermo Aquino jests in one viral video, in which a young man apologizes to a potential partner, saying he has only one condom left until the end of the year. �I love you, it�s not you, it�s the socio-economic situation,� adds the humorist. Underneath the comedy is a bleaker reality. South American�s No. 2 economy is expected to shrink 2.6% this year and is grappling with 50%-plus annual inflation. The peso currency has lost two thirds of its value against the dollar since the start of 2018, hammering imports and consumption. Domestic sales of cars, wines and meat have dipped as wallets have been squeezed. Industry sources estimated condom sales are down 8% since the start of the year compared to 2018, and have fallen by a quarter over recent months as the economic crisis has worsened. Most condoms, or the materials needed to make them, are imported, so a weaker currency has an immediate impact on the price, up some 36% since the start of the year, said Felipe Kopelowicz, president of Kopelco, manufacturer of Tulip�n and Gentleman condom brands. Sales of birth control pill sales are also down - 6% for the year and by a fifth more recently, pharmacists said. Isabel Reinoso, president of the Argentina Pharmaceutical Confederation, told Reuters price rises meant thousands of women were going off the pill. �It�s around 144,000 women who have stopped taking contraceptives each month,� she said. Public health experts said the issue could aggravate levels of sexually transmitted disease. �When you�re just thinking about getting by day to day, health is often relegated and sexual health, which is still taboo and has little support, even more so,� said Mar Lucas, program director at Fundaci�n Hu�sped, an Argentine non-profit organization fighting HIV. The government does distribute free condoms in public hospitals, but few know about it, she said. �We know they are rarely used, misused and used inconsistently. And so we keep having a lot of sexually transmitted infections,� added Lucas. Argentina�s Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Emiliano Di Ilio, a pharmacist working in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, told Reuters that steep inflation had caused sales of condoms and contraceptive pills in his pharmacy to fall by 20% and 25% respectively in the last two months. �People come, ask the price, and then just leave,� he said.

OnePlus 7T will be launched in India on September 26.",BGR India,"OnePlus is set to launch the OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro on September 26. The smartphones will arrive as successors to OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro which were launched at the beginning of this year. Ahead of the launch, OnePlus has already confirmed that it is making 90Hz display standard on its flagships this year. The company showed the design which confirmed that it will have a circular rear camera module. Apart from design and display, OnePlus is also planning big changes to charging capabilities.OnePlus has now announced that its next flagship smartphones will come equipped with Warp Charge 3T. It will apparently charge the devices at 23 percent faster speeds. �We believe that Warp Charge 30T offers the best charging solution for real-world usage. You can charge the phone at 23% faster speeds, even while using the device,� OnePlus CEO Pete Lau told TechRadar. The existing OnePlus 7 supports 20W fast charge while OnePlus 7 Pro supports 30W Warp Charge.�We�re not going to introduce something for the sake of being first,� Lau said about new fast charging feature. �We took time to refine and iterate, continuously testing until we were able to achieve something we were proud to provide to our fans.�OnePlus has also confirmed that users will be able to use the same 30W Warp Charge charging brick with their new phone. Lau also revealed that Warp Charge 30 handles the power management inside of the power brick instead of inside the phone. This allows the phone to remain cool even when the device is charging at a faster rate and even when it is in use. �Our latest Warp Charge delivers 6A at 5V to attain 30W,� Lau told TechRadar.Even Apple has added fast charging to new iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max.

Chinmayanand is a rapist, and his name should not be associated with Yogi Adityanath, she said.The woman who accused Chinmayanand, has been charged with an extortion case against him filed by Chinmayanand�s team, reported NDTV.In a press release issued by the Special Investigation Team, the law student�s name featured as the fourth name among the accused as �Ms A�, reported The Hindu, but the police is yet to get clarity on whether her name was included in the extortion case FIR or explicitly named her as an accused.The police is yet to recover the mobile phones of Sanjay Singh, the key accused in the extortion case and the law student.Earlier in the day, Chinmayanand was arrested earlier from Shahjahanpur after a UP law student levelled rape charges against him, has been sent to 14 day judicial custody by a local court.The UP Police SIT, in a press conference, said that Chinmayanand has admitted to almost every allegation levelled against him, including sexual conversations.Also Read : Law Student Threatens Self-immolation, Chinmayanand HospitalisedUP DGP OP Singh sought to counter criticisms that the SIT had been dragging its heels on the case, saying to ANI:�On direction of the SC we had constituted an SIT team and after a probe we arrested Swami Chinmayanand from his ashram and he has been sent to jail. There has been no delay in the case. We have also arrested three people over extortion threats to Swami Chinmayanand.�The DGP also stated that charges of rape have also been added to the complaint against the BJP leader (see video above at 1:17).However, after local reporters questioned this, The Quint was able to confirm that no charges of rape have actually been added by the SIT.The Quint accessed a report of the SIT which shows that, in addition to the original offences of kidnapping and criminal intimidation alleged by the survivor�s father, the SIT has added offences under Section 376C and Section 354D of the IPC.Supreme Court advocate Vrinda Grover strongly criticised this move by the SIT, saying that this was a �very clear dilution of the offences and a weakening of the case.�Section 376C of the IPC deals with sexual intercourse by a position in authority, which does not amount to rape. It is punishable with rigorous imprisonment of five to ten years.According to Grover, the correct provisions of law that were attracted in this case were under Section 376(2) of the IPC, which deals with �aggravated rape�, and is punishable with at least ten years� life imprisonment, if not life imprisonment. Specifically, she said the complaint disclosed offences under sub-clausesGrover was of the view that the failure to add Section 376(2) to the FIR showed that there �is a very, very clear dilution of the offences and a weakening of the case.� She pointed out that this provision is more serious as�has a corresponding section in the Indian Evidence Act. These aggravated rapes are circumstances where the rape is committed in a situation where the woman is in a coercive circumstance. And therefore, you cannot plead consent. The presumption shifts to the accused if the woman says that she did not consent and that sexual intercourse is proved.�She therefore believes this constitutes a �clear effort to shield the accused�.The Quint tried to contact DGP OP Singh for a response, but he was unavailable for comment.Pooja Singh, the lawyer representing Chinmayanand told ANI that the BJP leader was arrested from his residence, when his health was critical. He was under the observation of doctors when the police arrived, she added, saying that she was not allowed to meet him.He has been taken for medical examination to a government hospital, she said.Singh said the SIT took signatures of Chinmayanand's relatives on the arrest memo but no arrest-related documents, including a copy of the FIR, were given to them.As Chinmayanand was taken to the hospital for medical check-up, patients had to face a tough time as they were not allowed to enter the premises, according to PTI.Teams led by senior police officials have been deployed at the court premises and the hospital. A team of police officials is also patrolling the area to ensure there is no disturbance, a senior official said.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said the government took action against Chinmayanand only after the woman, who accused him of rape, threatened self-immolation.Taking to Twitter, she said it was the strength of the public and journalism that Chinmayanand had to be arrested.""The BJP government is so thick skinned that it did not take action till the rape survivor said that she will self immolate herself. This is the strength of the public and of journalism that the SIT had to arrest Chinmayanand,"" she said.""The public has ensured that 'Beti Bachao' does not remain in mere slogans but becomes a reality on the ground,"" she added.The 23-year-old woman, a student at a law college that Chinmayanand runs, has alleged that Chinmayanand sexually exploited her for a year after helping her with admission into his college.Inspector General Naveen Arora, who heads the SIT, said a mobile phone and a pen drive given by the student have been sent for forensic examination.The pen drive contains 43 video clips which the student says support her allegations, PTI reported.Police has registered a case of criminal intimidation and abduction against Chinmayanand on a complaint lodged by the woman's father. Later, the student also accused him of rape and ""physical exploitation"".Also Read : Chinmayanand Examined by Doctors After Complaining of UneasinessChinmayanand, who was admitted to the medical college in Shahjahanpur on Wednesday, was referred to King George's Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow.But he chose to return to his residence on Thursday and get ayurvedic treatment there, according to his counsel Om Singh.He underwent several tests at the Shahjahanpur hospital where a team of four doctors monitored his condition, a spokesperson told PTI.The student had earlier threatened self-immolation if the police do not arrest him.(With inputs from PTI, ANI, NDTV and The Hindu)(Hi there!

674,Indonesians oppose law criminalising consensual sex outside marriage,"Indonesians have signed a petition opposing a law that criminalises consensual sex outside marriage. A maximum one-year prison term can be applied to a person who has sex with someone who is not their spouse. There would also be a maximum four-year prison term for women who have an abortion, applicable if there is no medical emergency or rape involved.",Reuters,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is poised to pass a new penal code that criminalizes consensual sex outside marriage and introduces stiff penalties for insulting the president�s dignity - a move rights groups  criticized as an intrusive assault on basic freedoms. Indonesia is the world�s most populous Muslim majority country and has substantial Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities, but has seen a recent trend towards deeper religious piety and conservative Islamic activism. The new criminal code is due to be adopted in the next week after parliament and the government agreed a final draft on Wednesday, four parliamentarians told Reuters. Lawmakers told Reuters that the new penal code, which would replace a Dutch colonial-era set of laws, was a long overdue expression of Indonesian independence and religiosity.     �The state must protect citizens from behavior that is contrary to the supreme precepts of God,� said Nasir Djamil, a politician from the Prosperous Justice Party. He said leaders of all religions had been consulted on the changes given that Indonesia�s founding ideology was based on belief in God.  Under the proposed laws, unmarried couples who �live together as a husband and wife� could be jailed for six months or face a maximum fine of 10 million rupiah ($710), which is three months� salary for many Indonesians.  A prosecution can proceed if a village chief, who heads the lowest tier of government, files a complaint with police, and parents or children of the accused do not object. Parents, children and spouses can also lodge a complaint. The inclusion of the new power for village chiefs was warranted because �the victim of adultery is also society�, another lawmaker, Teuku Taufiqulhadi, said. The Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, an NGO, said millions of Indonesians could be ensnared by the new laws. It noted a study indicating that 40 per cent of Indonesian adolescents engaged in pre-marital sexual activity. �Across the board, this is a ratcheting up of conservatism. It�s extremely regressive,� said Tim Lindsey, director of the University of Melbourne�s Centre for Indonesian Law, Islam and Society. A maximum one-year prison term also can be applied to a person who has sex with someone who is not their spouse and a close family member lodges a complaint. The law also impacts homosexuals as gay marriage is not recognized in Indonesia. The code also establishes prison terms for those found to commit �obscene acts�, defined as violating norms of decency and politeness through �lust or sexuality�, whether by heterosexuals or gay people. The new laws will also apply to foreigners. However, asked whether tourists in Indonesia could face jail for extramarital sex, Taufiqulhadi said: �No problem, as long as people don�t know.� There would also be a maximum four-year prison term for women who have an abortion, applicable if there was no medical emergency or rape involved. The code further introduces fines for some people who promote contraception, and a six-month prison term for unauthorized discussion of �tools of abortion�. In addition, local authorities would get greater freedom to introduce punishments for breaches of customary laws not covered in the penal code. There are more than 400 local regulations that activists say impinge civil rights, such as the mandatory wearing of a hijab, an Islamic headscarf for women. Meanwhile, parliament has reintroduced the offence of �attacking the honor or dignity� of Indonesia�s president and vice president. A similar law was struck down by the Constitutional Court in 2006, and the new version is likely to be challenged by rights activists as well. Insulting the government and state institutions also carries a prison term.

675,Pak activist who highlighted Army's abuses flees to US after threats,"Gulalai Ismail, the Pakistani human rights activist who highlighted the abuses committed by Pakistan's military, has fled to the US following threats to her and her family. She had also spoken about the abuses suffered by Pakistani women, including forced marriages and honour killings. Ismail is accused of ""anti-state activities"" and ""inciting violence"".",ANI,"Washington DC [USA], Sept 20 (ANI): Gulalai Ismail, the Pakistani rights activist who has been accused of treason by Islamabad, has revealed that she has escaped to the US via Sri Lanka.In an interview with Afghan journalist Bashir Ahmad Gwakh of Mashaal Radio, Ismail said she was hiding in Pakistan for nearly six months and said she travelled to Sri Lanka with the help of her friends before leaving for the US.Ismail took the baton to highlight incidents of sexual abuse by Pakistani security forces. Following her crusade against the atrocities committed on country's women, she was slapped with treason charges.The 32-year old rights activist managed to slip through the dragnet last month and is now staying with her sister in Brooklyn in New York. She has also applied for political asylum in the US.Even though she has been able to escape to America, she is still worried about her parents and people who helped her during the days of hiding.""Pakistan thinks that the US Department of State will force me to leave the US along with my family. But, I will continue my struggle in the US,"" Ismail told Mashaal Radio.In a country like Pakistan, where criticism of the military is frowned upon, Ismail campaigned vigorously for women's rights, bringing attention to rapes, disappearances and other abuses that she and many others say have been committed by the country's security forces.Ismail became a fugitive in May in her country, soon after she posted accusations on social media against Pakistani soldiers. In her posts on Facebook and Twitter, she had accused soldiers of raping and sexually abusing Pakistani women on her Facebook and Twitter pages in January this year.The woman right activist also took part in the ethnic Pashtun movement. The movement headed by Manzoor Pashteen has now become another headache for the Pakistani Army, whose heavy-handed techniques to crush the movement has failed miserably.""There are misconceptions about Pashtuns in America that needs to be fixed. From there, I will be fighting and the world will know that Pashtuns are the victims of war,"" said Ismail.Human rights defenders believe that the charges of treason against her were false and that she was being targeted for pointing out the blatant abuses committed by the Pakistani military.Ismail has been barred by the Pakistani government from leaving the country.In November last year, Pakistan-based media outlet Dawn reported that the Islamabad High Court was informed that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had recommended putting Ismail's name on the Exit Control List (ECL) for her alleged anti-state activities abroad.However, the court had ordered the removal of her name from the list following a petition by Ismail challenging the government's decision to put her name on the ECL. But, the court allowed the interior ministry to take appropriate action, including confiscation of her passport, in the light of recommendations made by ISI.

Things may have been much different if Steve Jobs were still alive, though, because Iger believes a Disney-Apple merger would have happened (or at least seriously considered) under their leadership. Iger revealed his thoughts in a Vanity Fair article adapted from his upcoming autobiography.Iger talked about his friendship with Jobs in the piece, telling the story of how Disney managed to acquire Pixar happened even though Jobs held a ""deep-rooted"" animosity toward Disney at the time. He also talked about they discussed the future of TV before the iPhone's release and how he told Jobs that he envisioned an iTunes-like platform for television.""With every success the company has had since Steve's death, there's always a moment in the midst of my excitement when I think, I wish Steve could be here for this...

It may simply be one of the most compelling parts of his book, but it makes one wonder if it's because he's currently trying to make a Disney-Apple merger happen. As CNBC notes, though, an acquisition likely wouldn't get approved now that authorities have become more conscious of how big-tech mergers are being viewed as anti-competitive.

""We have already said that we're taking the steps to be ready to go public in 2019...doesn't mean we'll go public in 2019,"" Co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk had said in March. Airbnb was last privately valued at $31 billion in September 2017, according to PitchBook.",Engadget,"Airbnb has put to rest speculation about the timing of its IPO. The vacation rental company today took the rare step of announcing in a press release that it plans to go public next year, in 2020. The startup, which first launched in 2008, has grown to become a $30 billion company, with more listings than the eight largest hotel groups in the world, combined.The company yesterday published an optimistic update on its future. ""As our community has grown, our business has thrived. In the second quarter of 2019, Airbnb recognized substantially more than $1 billion in revenue. The second quarter of 2019 marked the second quarter in our history in which Airbnb revenue exceeded $1 billion.""The initial plan was for Airbnb to go public as soon as this year, along with Uber and Lyft. But back in March, company co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk cast doubt on such a plan. ""We have already said that we are taking the steps to be ready to go public in 2019. That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019,"" said Blecharczyk in an interview with Business Insider.As a publicly traded company, Airbnb still may have an uncertain trajectory ahead. Lower than expected market debuts for Lyft and Uber may lower the confidence of investors. WeWork, another Silicon Valley startup that aimed to go public this year, postponed plans after being unable to secure enough funding.But unlike other startups, Airbnb has turned a profit. The company said revenue topped $1 billion in the second quarter of 2019, the second time it has done so. It also acquired both HotelTonight and travel company Urbandoor this year. Still, regulatory pushbacks from cities all over the world and concerns over quality control may lead to future setbacks.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/19/airbnb-plans-to-go-public-in-2020/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Meanwhile, Arsenal defeated Eintracht 3-0 in their Europa League opener.",Reuters,"MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Seventeen-year-old striker Mason Greenwood scored his first senior Manchester United goal and saved his side�s blushes in a 1-0 win over Kazakhstan�s Astana in their Europa League Group L opener at Old Trafford on Thursday. The prodigy slotted home through the keeper�s legs at the near post in the 73rd minute to make history in only his second start as the first player born in the 2000s to score a senior goal for the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer�s youthful line-up had earlier struggled to dominate their weakest opponents in the group despite having plenty of possession. United made nine changes to the side that started against Leicester City in the Premier League last weekend, with Nemanja Matic taking the captain�s role in the absence of Ashley Young and goalkeeper David De Gea. They came close to scoring after three minutes when Fred�s powerful long-distance strike from smacked off the top of the crossbar. Marcus Rashford missed another great chance 10 minutes later with a close-range shot straight at the goalkeeper. �We made it hard for ourselves,� said Solskjaer, relieved at least to be leading Group L after Partizan Belgrade and AZ Alkmaar drew 2-2 in Serbia. �It�s pleasing, though, that we got three points, got off to a decent start. �In and around the box he (Greenwood) is one of the best finishers we�ve got and I�m happy he got his goal. I�m sure he�ll go home tonight and be happy with that one.� While he partnered 21-year-old regular Rashford up front, teenagers Angel Gomes and Tahith Chong made their full debuts before being replaced by Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard respectively. Lingard hit the post in the 80th minute and Diogo Dalot missed a sitter in front of 50,000 fans as United raised the tempo after going ahead but still looked short of creativity. �It was a hard game. First half we tried to open the game and to score a fast goal but they had a solid defence,� Matic told BT Sport. �It�s good for the (young players) to have the opportunity to play these games. They have to use that, to work hard to get more chances.� Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond",https://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-europa-mun-ast-report/greenwood-grabs-first-goal-for-man-united-in-1-0-win-over-astana-idINKBN1W42YM?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

723,"Tunisia's ex-Prez Ben Ali, whose ouster sparked Arab Spring, dies","Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, the former Tunisian President whose ouster in 2011 triggered the Arab Spring, died in exile in Saudi Arabia at the age of 83. Ben Ali came to power in 1987 after overthrowing then-President Habib Bourguiba in a coup. He took over as head of military security in 1964 and as head of national security in 1977.",Reuters,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia�s Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, whose overthrow in a 2011 uprising triggered the �Arab Spring� revolutions, died in exile in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, days after a free presidential vote in his homeland.  His funeral will take place on Friday in Saudi Arabia, his family lawyer, Mounir Ben Salha, told Reuters. �It is the end of dictators like him. We cannot forget that he destroyed our country ... he gave orders to kill civilians in protests in 2011,� said Imad Layouni, an unemployed 26-year-old in a Tunis coffee shop.  Ben Ali fled Tunisia in January 2011 as his compatriots - many of them angered after a vegetable seller set himself on fire a few weeks earlier in protest at the police - rose up against his oppressive rule in a revolution that inspired other uprisings in the Middle East and led to a democratic transition at home.  On Sunday, they voted in an election that featured candidates from across the political spectrum, sending two political outsiders through to a second round vote unthinkable during Ben Ali�s two decades in power. However, while Tunisians have enjoyed a much smoother march to democracy than citizens of the other Arab states that also rose up in 2011, many of them are economically worse off than they were under Ben Ali.  While almost all the candidates in Sunday�s election were vocal champions of the revolution, one of them, Abir Moussi, campaigned as a supporter of Ben Ali�s ousted government, receiving 4% of the votes.  �It is a sign of the intolerance in country, which claims to be a democracy, that he died in Saudi Arabia,� said Salwa Riahi, a doctor in Tunis.  A former security chief, Ben Ali had run Tunisia for 23 years, taking power when, as prime minister in 1987, he declared president-for-life Habib Bourguiba medically unfit to rule.  In office, he sought to stifle any form of political dissent while opening up the economy, a policy that led to rapid growth but also fuelled grotesque inequality and accusations of brazen corruption, not least among his own relatives.  During that era, his photograph was displayed in every shop, school and government office from the beach resorts of the Mediterranean coast to the impoverished villages and mining towns of Tunisia�s hilly interior.  On the few occasions his rule was put to the vote, he faced only nominal opposition and won re-election by more than 99%.  On Sunday, by contrast Tunisians chose between 26 candidates including both Ben Ali�s own former supporter Moussi and an ex-political prisoner running for the Islamist Ennahda party, which he banned.  Ben Ali�s rise began in the army after Bourguiba won Tunisia�s independence from France in 1956. He was head of military security from 1964, and of national security from 1977.  After a three-year stint as ambassador to Poland, he was called back to his old security job in 1984 to quell riots over bread prices. Now a general, he was made interior minister in 1986 and prime minister in 1987.  It took him less than three weeks to arrange a new promotion to the top job, bringing in a team of doctors to declare Bourguiba senile, meaning he would automatically take over as head of state.  His first decade as president involved a big economic restructuring - backed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank - and an annual growth rate slightly over 4% a year.   Wedged between Muammar Gaddafi�s Libya and an Algeria thrust into civil war between the army-backed government and Islamist militants, Ben Ali�s Tunisia followed the post-independence path of secularism and openness to the outside.  But within, critics said it was a police state where few dared challenge an all-powerful government. In a country where many had experienced life under democracy elsewhere, Ben Ali�s oppressive state was reason to chafe.  Meanwhile, the elite were accumulating wealth in their extravagant seaside villas. The lavish lifestyle of Ben Ali�s wife, Leila Trabelsi, and her clique of rich relatives, came to symbolise the corruption of an era.  Out in the provinces, in the shabby towns of the south and the rural villages without running water, anger was growing, leading to a small protest movement in 2008, sometimes called �the little revolution�. Eight years on from the real uprising, life is still tough in those areas, with unemployment higher than in 2010 and public services seeming to have deteriorated.  Tunisians often complain that living standards have dropped since the revolution, and speak of life under Ben Ali as more materially comfortable. But few speak with nostalgia of his style of rule, or say they want an end to democracy.  For Ben Ali, the sudden end came when a desperate vegetable seller in the humble town of Sidi Bouzid set himself alight in December 2010 after police confiscated his barrow.  Mohammed Bouazizi�s funeral was attended by tens of thousands of furious people, sparking weeks of ever bigger protests in which scores of people were killed.  By mid January 2011, Ben Ali had had enough, and boarded a plane for Saudi Arabia. A Tunisian court sentenced him in absentia later that year to 35 years in prison. He never appeared in public again.

728,It'll not take Smith long to be the captain again: Ponting,"Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said that once the captaincy ban of batsman Steve Smith ends, it'll not take long for him to be named as the team's captain again. ""I don't know what the Australian public might think about that,"" he added. Steve Smith was banned for two years from captaincy for his role in the 2018 ball-tampering scandal.",Times Now,"Steve Smith is being hailed as a phenom following his astounding effort with the willow in the recently concluded Ashes 2019. The Aussie batsman piled up as many as 774 runs in just seven innings at an average of more than 100 as he helped Australia retain the Ashes for the first time since 2001 on English soil. While Smith has returned to the Australia squad as just a player, not captain, former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting has backed Smith to take the captain�s armband sooner or later.However, Ponting was unsure of how things would be taken in Australia if Smith is made the captain of the team once again. The 30-year-old was sacked from captaincy following his involvement in the infamous sandpaper ball-tampering scandal in 2018 which rocked Australia cricket.Smith was handed out a 12-month ban along with David Warner while Cameron Bancroft was given a nine-month ban. In addition to the ban, it was stated by Cricket Australia that Smith won�t be considered for a leadership role for a year after the ban finishes.""Steve Smith � I think he will captain again. I don't know what the Australian public might think about that,"" Ponting said at an event at Australia House in London.""So to me that seems like Cricket Australia has left the gate open ... so if Cricket Australia thinks it's OK then I'm happy with [it,]"" Ponting added.The former Aussie skipper said Smith knows his role in the team even without the captain�s armband. Ponting reckoned that it won�t be too long until Smith is back being the captain of the team once the ban is lifted.""I think he knows his role now. But once that ban is lifted, I don't think it will be too long until he's captain again,"" Ponting said.Tim Paine�s captaincy came under the scanner during Ashes 2019 following glovesman's repeated failure of successfully taking DRS. It was a DRS mistake by Paine and Australia which had cost them the Headingley Test.Paine�s batting form has also been a talking point for quite some time now. Since October 2018, Paine has managed to score just two half-centuries in Test cricket and such things may play a role if he is to be removed from captaincy�role in future. However, it will be interesting to see how the Australian fans react if Smith is given the captain�s armband once again.",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/i-think-he-will-captain-again-ricky-ponting-backs-steve-smith-to-become-australias-captain/491372?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

730,UP progressing at bullock-cart speed: Akhilesh Yadav,"After Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath claimed that the state has seen development during his tenure so far, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said UP is developing at snail's pace. ""The pace of development is not that of a double-engine machine but of a bullock cart,"" he added. ""The UP government is making false claims and celebrating,"" Yadav further said.",The Financial Express,"Opposition parties Thursday contested Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath�s claims on development and law and order during the first half of his term, with the Samajwadi Party saying Uttar Pradesh is moving at the speed of a bullock cart.�The UP government is making false claims and celebrating the completion of two-and-a-half years. People thought that with a double engine the state�s progress will gain momentum, but it is moving ahead at a snail�s pace,� SP president Akhilesh Yadav said.The �double engine� was a reference to the BJP�s earlier claim that the state will develop quicker with the same party in power in Lucknow and at the Centre.�The pace of the state�s development is not that of a double-engine machine but of a bullock cart,� Yadav said.The opposition attack followed Adityanath�s press conference here on his government reaching the mid-point of its five-year term. Adityanath had claimed that the perception about the state has changed during his term and the �improvement� in law and order had played an important role in this.�There has not been a single incident of riot in the state in the past two-and-half years,� Adityanath said, referring apparently to large-scale communal clashes. The Opposition parties disagreed.�The chief minister�s claims on law and order are far from truth. The reality is that during his tenure crime against girls has hit an all-time high,� Yadav said.�So many murders never took place in the past,� he claimed. �UP has surpassed other states in incidents of loot, rape and murder.�Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar said, �The law and order scenario in the state is grim.��There is fear in the minds of the people. Incidents of rape are being reported from different parts of the state. Atrocities committed on women and murders are taking place at busy locations in the state capital,� Babbar alleged.Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said the BJP government�s record in the state so far has been �disappointing�.�This government has failed badly particularly on law and order and controlling crime,� she tweeted in Hindi.Congress spokesman Anshu Awasthi said the government�s �only achievement� has been saving �rapist MLAs� and leaders associated with it.Rashtriya Lok Dal spokesperson Anil Dubey also referred to crime against women and the notices served by the National Human Rights Commission to the state.The remarks were an indirect reference to the rape accusation against former Union minister Swami Chinmayanand in Shahjahanpur and a similar charge against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Unnao.Though the Shahjahanpur woman recorded her statement before a magistrate on Monday, an FIR mentioning the rape charge is yet to be lodged in the state.The police, however, say they are following procedure and will submit a report to the Supreme Court after completing their probe by September 23.During his press meet, Adityanath said the prosecution in sexual assault cases against minors has been speeded up.He gave an example from Auraiya, in which a life imprisonment sentence has already been pronounced for a rape committed in the first week of August.Akhilesh Yadav claimed the BJP government is patting itself on back over farm loan waiver but the farmers are still committing suicide.Congress spokesperson Awasthi asked, �What happened to the promise to the youth on providing jobs?��This government has, however, been successful in organising big events by spending a lot of money, claiming investment of over Rs 4.28 lakh crore through the investors� summit. But what is the result? They lack the right intention of seeing these development projects become a reality,� he said.RLD�s Dubey claimed the Adityanath government has failed to keep its promises not only on law and order, but also on issues concerning farmers, youth and women.�Inflation, power tariff hike and unemployment are glaring issues but the government has remained busy in just patting its back without caring for the problems of the common man,� Dubey added.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market�s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

734,Many options short of war with Iran: Trump after Saudi attacks,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said there were many options short of war with Iran after drone attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities. Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said were used in the attacks, describing them as evidence of Iran's involvement. Trump recently ordered the US Treasury to ""substantially"" increase the sanctions on Iran.",Reuters,"LOS ANGELES/JEDDAH (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday there were many options short of war with Iran after U.S. ally Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said were used in a crippling attack on its oil sites that was �unquestionably sponsored� by Tehran.  �There are many options. There�s the ultimate option and there are options that are a lot less than that. And we�ll see,� Trump told reporters in Los Angeles. �I�m saying the ultimate option meaning go in � war.� The president struck a cautious note as his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during a visit to Saudi Arabia, described the attacks as �an act of war� on the kingdom, the world�s largest oil exporter. Trump said on Twitter that he had ordered the U.S. Treasury to �substantially increase sanctions� on Iran, which denies carrying out the attacks, and told reporters the unspecified, punitive economic measures would be unveiled within 48 hours. Trump�s tweet followed repeated U.S. assertions that the Islamic Republic was behind Saturday�s attacks and came hours after Saudi Arabia said the strike was a �test of global will�. Iran again denied involvement in the Sept. 14 raids, which hit the world�s biggest crude oil processing facility and initially knocked out half of Saudi output. Saudi Arabia is the world�s leading oil exporter.  Responsibility was claimed by Yemen�s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which on Wednesday gave more details of the raid, saying it was launched from three sites in Yemen.  In a remark that may further strain a tense political atmosphere in the Gulf, the Houthis said they had listed dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh�s top Arab ally, as possible targets for attacks. To bolster its assertion that Iran was responsible, Saudi Arabia showed drone and missile debris it said amounted to undeniable evidence of Iranian aggression.  A total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks sponsored by Iran but not launched from Yemen, Defense Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told a news conference.�The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,� he said, adding Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were used in addition to cruise missiles. An investigation into the origin of the attacks was still under way and the result will be announced later, he said. The attack exposed gaps in Saudi air defenses despite billions spent on Western military hardware. Proof of Iranian responsibility, and evidence that the attack was launched from Iranian territory, could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response. Both nations, however, were stressing the need for caution.  Trump has previously said he does not want war and is coordinating with Gulf and European states. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia�s de facto ruler, said the strike was a �real test of the global will� to confront subversion of the international order. His envoy to London, Prince Khalid bin Bander, told the BBC the attack was �almost certainly� Iranian-backed: �We�re trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.� The Islamic Republic dismissed the allegations. �They want to impose maximum ... pressure on Iran through slander,� Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said.  �We don�t want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?� he added, blaming Washington and its Gulf allies for the war in Yemen. Yemen�s Houthi movement, battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition for more than four years, said it used drones to assault state oil company Aramco�s sites. U.S. officials, however, have said the attack was not launched by the Houthis. The raid exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia�s oil infrastructure and threw down a gauntlet to the United States, which wants to curb Iranian influence in the region. �The attack is like Sept. 11th for Saudi Arabia. It is a game changer,� said one Saudi security analyst. Visiting Jeddah, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attacks would be a major focus of next week�s annual U.N. General Assembly meeting and suggested Saudi Arabia could make its case there. �It was an act of war against them directly, and I�m confident they will do that,� he told reporters before meeting the Saudi crown prince, later tweeting that the United States supports Saudi Arabia�s right to defend itself.         The two men �agreed that the Iranian regime�must be held accountable for its continued�aggressive, reckless, and�threatening behavior,� the U.S. State Department said in a statement after their talks. U.N. officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were also heading to Saudi Arabia to investigate. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a major confrontation in the Gulf would have �devastating consequences� for the region and globally.  France, which is trying to salvage an international nuclear deal with Iran that Washington quit last year, said it wanted to establish the facts before reacting. A U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday the strikes originated in southwestern Iran. Three officials said they involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating more complexity and sophistication than initially thought. Saudi Arabia�s finance minister told Reuters the attack had no impact on revenues and Aramco was continuing to supply markets without interruption. U.S. efforts to bring about a U.N. Security Council response looked unlikely to succeed as Russia and China have veto powers and were expected to shield Iran. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has offered to sell  defense systems to Riyadh, called for a �thorough and impartial� probe during a phone call with Prince Mohammed. IRAN-U.S. CONFLICT The 2015 nuclear deal ushered in a brief detente in long hostile relations between Iran and the United States. But antagonism returned when Trump pulled out of the pact, reached before he took office, and reimposed sanctions, severely damaging the Iranian economy. Iran has ruled out talks with Washington unless it returns to the pact.   Trump said he is not looking to meet Rouhani at the United Nations next week. Rouhani and his foreign minister may not attend the annual General Assembly at all unless U.S. visas are issued in the coming hours, Iranian state media reported. Washington and its Gulf allies want Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, as well as to put more limitations on its nuclear and missile programs.

740,Smith is a better Test batsman than Indian skipper Kohli: Panesar,"Spinner Monty Panesar has said that Australia batsman Steve Smith is a better Test batsman than Virat Kohli. ""But if you take an overall package, especially limited-overs, Virat stands out. He is overall a world-class batsman. Virat is the best batsman in the world. Smith is the best Test batsman in the world,"" Panesar added.",CricTracker,"There�s very little doubt that Steve Smith and Virat Kohli are two of the best batsmen in world cricket currently. Smith made a staggering comeback to the Australian team in the recently concluded Ashes series. While most experts are divided and aren�t too sure who is the better amongst the two, many are backing Steve Smith in Tests.Former England off-spinner Monty Panesar is also of the opinion that Smith is the better of the two batsmen. Smith has twenty-six centuries to Kohli�s twenty-five centuries. As an overall package, he is a tad behind Kohli but only when it comes to crowning the best in the longest form of the game, the Indian skipper comes second best.Advertisement�Steve Smith is a better Test batsman than Virat Kohli,� Panesar told The Times of India (TOI) in an exclusive interview. �But if you take an overall package, especially limited-overs, Virat stands out. He is overall a world class batsman. Virat is the best batsman in the world. Smith is the best Test batsman in the world,� said Panesar.Monty Panesar who played fifty Tests for England claiming 167 wickets praised India�s premier batsman even more by saying that with his consistency and ability he surely will beat Sachin Tendulkar�s record of hundred international centuries.The left-arm spinner also had some ravishing words of praise to share about India�s speed sensation Jasprit Bumrah. Bumrah has changed the landscape of Indian fast bowling according to Panesar. He felt that the pacer would go on to achieve more laurels for the country and said that his stint under Sachin Tendulkar with the Mumbai Indians led to his growth.�I am sure Sachin has played a crucial role in Bumrah�s development. He has a huge influence on him. What length to bowl, how to swing, how to judge a batsman- all these things he has learnt so quickly. How you think about the game and how you tactically take the right decisions- all these things Bumrah has learnt so fast under the able guidance of Sachin,� Panesar stated.Monty Panesar does make some valid observations. Steve Smith is probably the best in Test cricket now, the way in which he made a stunning, almost unbelievable comeback to the team post a one-year ban speaks volumes about his physical and mental strength. Overall, definitely India�s crown Virat Kohli would rank ahead of Smith and it won�t be too surprising to see him overtake Sachin Tendulkar�s coveted record of 100 international centuries.",https://www.crictracker.com/steve-smith-is-a-better-test-batsman-than-indian-skipper-virat-kohli-reckons-monty-panesar/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

But he revealed the last Test was a struggle for himself and fast bowler Peter Siddle.�My thumb was broken towards the end of that Test but it is not displaced, so I should be right to get back into training early,� said Paine, while praising workhorse Siddle who was battling a hip injury.�He has copped a bit of criticism for not bowling as well as� we know he can, but the team knows just how heroic he was. A lot of other people wouldn�t have bowled again in the match, but he pushed on because he didn�t want to leave Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to do extra work.�Coming off a long overseas tour and with five home Tests starting from November 21, Paine said he needs to rest and will not play the domestic Big Bash League Twenty20 competition this season.�Being captain is draining and I think I should take every chance to recharge my batteries,� he said.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/australia-have-got-the-best-bowling-attack-in-the-world-tim-paine-893114?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The strike came as the farmers were resting after having finished collecting pine nuts. Around 150 workers were there for harvesting, with some missing after the strike, the owner of the pine nuts field said.",Reuters,"JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A U.S. drone strike intended to hit an Islamic State (IS) hideout in Afghanistan killed at least 30 civilians resting after a day�s labour in the fields, officials said on Thursday. The attack on Wednesday night also injured 40 people after accidentally targeting farmers and labourers who had just finished collecting pine nuts at mountainous Wazir Tangi in eastern Nangarhar province, three Afghan officials told Reuters. �The workers had lit a bonfire and were sitting together when a drone targeted them,� tribal elder Malik Rahat Gul told Reuters by telephone from Wazir Tangi.  Afghanistan�s Defence Ministry and a senior U.S official in Kabul confirmed the drone strike, but did not share details of civilian casualties. �U.S. forces conducted a drone strike against Da�esh (IS) terrorists in Nangarhar,� said Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. �We are aware of allegations of the death of non-combatants and are working with local officials to determine the facts.� About 14,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, training and advising Afghan security forces and conducting counter-insurgency operations against IS and the Taliban movement.

A survivor of the drone strike said about 200 labourers were sleeping in five tents pitched near the farm when the attack happened. �Some of us managed to escape, some were injured but many  were killed,� said Juma Gul, a resident of northeastern Kunar province who had travelled along with labourers to harvest and shell pine nuts this week.

American forces must realise (they) will never win the war by killing innocent civilians,� said Javed Mansur, a resident of Jalalabad city.  Scores of local men joined a protest against the attack on Thursday morning as they helped carry the victims� bodies to Jalalabad city and then to the burial site.  Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor said the aerial attack was meant to target IS militants who often use farmlands for training and recruitment purposes, but had hit innocent civilians.     Jihadist IS fighters first appeared in Afghanistan in 2014 and have since made inroads in the east and north where they are battling the government, U.S. forces and the Taliban. The exact number of IS fighters is difficult to calculate because they frequently switch allegiances, but the U.S. military estimates there are about 2,000. There was no word from IS on the attack.  There has been no let-up in assaults by Taliban and IS as Afghanistan prepares for a presidential election this month. In a separate incident, at least 20 people died in a suicide truck bomb attack on Thursday carried out by the Taliban in the southern province of Zabul. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting across Afghanistan after the collapse of U.S.-Taliban peace talks this month. The Taliban has warned U.S. President Donald Trump will regret his decision to abruptly call off talks that could have led to a political settlement to end the 18-year-old war. The United Nations says nearly 4,000 civilians were killed or wounded in the first half of the year. That included a big increase in casualties inflicted by government and U.S.-led foreign forces.

754,"People will target Sindhu at Olympics, they've year to plan: Coach","Badminton coach Pullela Gopichand has said that PV Sindhu, who recently became the first Indian to win a gold at the World Championships, will be a strong contender for the gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. ""There is competition...it...just gets more for Sindhu because she will be the target, people have a year to plan against her,"" he added.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Pusarla Sindhu will be a strong contender for the women�s gold medal at next year�s Tokyo Olympics but the 24-year-old�s recent World Championship triumph will also make her a target, India�s national coach Pullela Gopichand said. Sindhu won India�s first-ever title at the world badminton championships when she defeated Japan�s Nozomi Okuhara 21-7 21-7 to win the women�s singles in Basel last month. It was also an end to Sindhu�s frustrating near-misses, having finished runner-up at the 2016 Olympics, last year�s Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and the previous two world championships finals. With her silver from Rio, Sindhu is already India�s most successful female Olympian but the latest triumph also boosted the nation�s hopes of a medal in Tokyo next year. �I think it would be fair to say that she would be one of the big contenders for the gold medal,� Gopichand told Reuters in an interview. �But having said that, there is competition, and it just gets more for Sindhu because she will be the target, people have a year to plan against her.  �So, of course she needs to train, she needs to evolve, she needs to add new thinking to the armoury and that�s very important.� While India�s field hockey team have won eight Olympic titles, shooter Abhinav Bindra remains the only individual gold medallist for the country of 1.3 billion, who are starved of top sporting success outside cricket. In the world championships semi-finals, an aggressive Sindhu dismantled China�s Chen Yufei 21-7 21-14 while it took her just 38 minutes in the final to see off Okuhara with the Japanese player wilting under a barrage of smashes from her opponent.      Gopichand was delighted with Sindhu�s aggression and termed the manner of her championship win as �very special�. He, however, warned her ward to continue to evolve ahead of Tokyo. �It will not be fair to say that there is no competition,� Gopichand said.  �I think players like (current Olympic champion) Carolina Marin, Tai Tzu-Ying, Ratchanok (Intanon), the Chinese girls, I think there are a lot of players who will be competition and it�ll be disrespectful to write off competition.  �Having said that, I think Sindhu has a good chance and hopefully will come with the better medal than last time.� Badminton�s popularity has grown by leaps and bounds in the country with Saina Nehwal�s bronze in women�s singles in the London Olympics setting a success path. While the country was toasting the success of Sindhu, the men�s sport also got a significant boost when B. Sai Praneeth won bronze in Basel. It was the first world championship medal for a male shuttler since Prakash Padukone won a bronze medal in 1983. The likes of Nehwal, Sindhu and Sai Praneeth are all products of the Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad where they have prospered under the watchful eyes of the former All England champion. �Sai Praneeth did a very important thing. Sai�s performance was something I am really happy with,� Gopichand said. �Sai�s medal got eclipsed by Sindhu�s phenomenal performance.  �I think what Sai has achieved for men�s badminton and the men to actually win a world championship bronze medal is a good starting point to do even better in the future.� Gopichand, however, does not agree that India was badminton�s new China, which has been the dominant force in the sport for decades. �I don�t think we can say that unless we win team events, unless we have depth in all our events and a good bench strength.� Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman",https://in.reuters.com/article/badminton-india/badminton-pv-sindhu-primed-for-tokyo-gold-says-coach-idINKBN1W418F?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Israel held its second election after Netanyahu failed to form a government after April polls.",The New Indian Express,"JERUSALEM:�Israel's embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday called on his main challenger Benny Gantz to form a unity government with him to avoid a third election, after no clear winner emerged in the unprecedented repeat polls.With nearly 97 per cent of votes counted on Thursday, Gantz's Blue and White party stood at 33 seats in Israel's 120-seat Parliament. Netanyahu's Likud stood at 31 seats. ""During the elections, I called for the establishment of a right-wing government, but, sadly, the results of the elections have shown that this is not possible,"" said 69-year-old Netanyahu, pointing out that the nation did not definitively side with either bloc.ALSO READ|�Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to skip UNGA session after polls setback""The Right cannot form a coalition and there should be as broad a unity government as possible. Therefore, there is no choice but to establish a wide unity government as wide as possible that's made up of all the officials that Israel called on,"" The Jerusalem Post quoted Netanyahu as saying.Netanyahu also asked Gantz, 60, to meet with him as soon as possible to start the process. ""I call on you MK Benny Gantz. Benny, it's on us to establish a wide unity government today. The nation expects us, the both of us, to work together. Let's meet today. At any time, at any moment. In order to begin this process that is demanded of us at this time.�We cannot and have no reason to go to a third election. I oppose it. The call of the hour is to form a broad unity government today,"" said Netanyahu.Netanyahu recalled the unity government between Shimon Peres and his Likud rival Yitzhak Shamir that was created in the 1980s when the election results were similarly deadlocked. ""When there was no clear outcome from the Knesset elections, Shimon chose national unity. He and Yitzhak Shamir agreed to cooperate - to navigate Israel's path to safety,"" the Likud leader said.He called on Gantz to follow in Peres' footsteps, so that together they could similarly navigate Israel to safety, the paper said. His statement about the Peres-Shamir cooperation was seen as a reference to a possible rotation in the Prime Minister's Office. The paper added that Peres and Shamir rotated as prime ministers from 1984 to 1988.�Blue and White rejected the offer as ""spin.""Meanwhile, the leaders of all the parties in the right-wing religious bloc on Thursday signed a document to recommend Netanyahu as the next prime minister and vowed to enter a coalition only as a single unit.

Netanyahu called the snap election after failing to form a governing coalition with a viable majority after April's vote.His victory in the April 9 polls securing him a record fifth term proved temporary in the face of a logjam between potential coalition partners over a military conscription bill governing exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students.With no clear winner, some analysts here see the chances of a coalition government coming in place quite bleak at the moment. Netanyahu, who has been premier for a total of more than 13 years, faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three cases.Israel has always had a coalition government and never seen a single party rule since its independence.

The Taliban, who have been carrying out nearly daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks with the United States this month, said the target was a nearby building of the government�s intelligence department in Qalat, the capital of Zabul province. �The bomb was huge and it was carried by a mini-truck,� said a senior defense ministry official in the capital, Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media.

The disease wiped out 100 million pigs in China, the world's largest pork consumer.",Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China auctioned 10,000 tonnes of pork from state reserves on Thursday to secure meat supply during the National Day holiday, the country�s commerce ministry said, after disease ravaged the world�s largest pig herd.  Beijing also released 2,400 tonnes of beef and 1,900 tonnes of mutton from state reserves this month, according to a statement published on the ministry�s website. Pork prices have jumped sharply recently and demand for the meat has fallen, the ministry said.  Graphic: China to release more meat from reserves to ensure supplies & cool pork prices     tmsnrt.rs/31za5sn The ministry said it would continue to monitor supplies and pork prices while coordinating with other government departments to release meat from state reserves as required to guarantee supply in the market. With a significant increase in meat imports and as the volume of frozen meat in reserves remains high, supplies are secured, it added. Thursday�s auction was seen by analysts as a symbolic gesture, however, and unlikely to cool pork prices. Those eclipsed 40 yuan ($5.64) per kilogramme in early September, almost 80% higher than a year earlier. �Our consumption is 12,000 tonnes a day,� said Ma Chuang, partner at Beijing-based consultancy Boyar. �It�s just a signal that the state is paying attention to the problem.� But Ma agreed that there was plenty of frozen meat in storage, with high prices being driven by the shortage in freshly slaughtered meat - much preferred over frozen in China - not a lack of meat overall. China celebrates its National Day on Oct. 1 with holidays lasting a whole week.  �During the holidays lots of people go travelling and eat out. The restaurants mainly use frozen meat so there won�t be a big impact,� said Ma, but he added that high prices were a longer-term concern. Pork prices in the world�s top consumer hit record levels after an epidemic of African swine fever that has reduced the hog herd by around 40%.

795,"Google to launch tokenised cards for Indian debit, credit card users","Google on Thursday announced that it's bringing tokenised cards to Indian debit and credit cardholders to allow them to pay for things using a digital token instead of their actual card number. The feature will be rolled out to Google Pay users in the coming weeks. It will start with Visa cards for HDFC, Axis, Kotak and Standard Chartered banks.",TechCrunch,"Google  said today it is bringing its mobile payments app � Google Pay � to businesses in India as the Android-maker rushes to maintain its payments lead in one of its key overseas markets before its global rival Facebook sets off a similar play in the nation.Even as more than 400 million users in India are online today, most businesses in the nation remain unconnected, Google executives said at their annual event in New Delhi. Google, which has previously launched a handful of tools in India to help businesses build some presence on the web, is having another crack at it.�India has more than 60 million small and medium-sized businesses, however only a fraction of them support digital payments. Imagine the transformation that is possible if more of these merchants could access payments online,� said Ambarish Kenghe, director and product manager for Google Pay.One of the big challenges that is preventing these businesses to support online payments is the tedious process that is currently required for them to on-board a digital payments solution. �An agent is supposed to come to your shop and then they do the verification for you,� he said. Google has figured out a better way to address this challenge.The company today unveiled Google Pay for Business, a standalone app that will enable businesses to accept online payments without having to deal with an agent. �Merchants will now be able to support digital payments at their own convenience through a remote video process within minutes,� he said.The company also unveiled a software platform called Spot that will allow businesses to easily create their own branded commercial fronts that will be accessible to customers through Google Pay app. So for instance, if a restaurant has built its store front, users will now be able to see their offerings in the Google Pay app itself. The company said several businesses in India like UrbanClap, Goibibo, MakeMyTrip, RedBus and Eat.Fit are already making use of this feature.�We hope these initiatives will help merchants adopt digital payments with more confidence, and help contribute the long-term growth of online financial services for the benefit of every Indian,� said Kenghe.The company has also developed Spot codes, which are like QR codes, that a business could use to allow people in its store to quickly scan and pick the items from the store they wish to order and pay for it. �A customer can come back later and pick up their orders without waiting in long lines,� explained Arjita Madan, a product manager at Google.The company is also bringing a feature that will enable users to discover entry-level and white-collar jobs through the Google Pay app. �Jobs will be available as a Spot on Google Pay to help job seekers find and prepare for entry-level positions that fit their needs,� said Caesar Sengupta (pictured above), VP of Next Billion Users Initiative and Payments at Google.He said Google is using machine learning to better understand its users, so that it recommends the right kind of jobs to them. A user only needs to provide two sets of information to get started with the feature: What kind of job are they looking for? And, how soon they want to land the job.About two dozen companies, including Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo in delivery and logistics and 24Seven and Healthkart in retail are early partners of Google to use Pay�s jobs discovery feature, the Mountain View giant said.Google launched its payments app Google Pay (called Tez then) in 2017. Pay is built on top of Indian government-backed UPI payments infrastructure and rivals Flipkart�s PhonePe app for the tentpole position. The company said today Google Pay has amassed 67 million monthly active users in India and has processed transactions worth $110 billion in the last year.The payments market in India � which is projected to be worth $1 trillion by 2023, according to Credit Suisse � is becoming aggressively crowded and competitive. Google today competes with PhonePe, Amazon Pay and Paytm, the country�s most popular mobile wallet app, whose parent company has raised more than $2.3 billion from investors.Google also announced that it is bringing tokenized cards for debit and credit cardholders in India, which will allow them to pay for things using a digital token instead of their actual card number. The company said it will roll out the feature to Google Pay users in the coming weeks, starting with Visa cards for HDFC, Axis, Kotak and Standard Chartered banks. The feature also will support Mastercard and Rupay at a later stage.The addition of new features is crucial for Google Pay, which prior to today�s announcements did not have many differentiating elements. It is also racing against time as Facebook�s WhatsApp, which has over 400 million users in India, is set to expand its UPI-based payments service to all its users by the end of the year.In the meantime, Paytm is working to expand its reach in the nation, too. The company, which posted a yearly loss of over $500 million last year, said earlier this month it intends to invest another $3 billion into its business in the next two years.Google is bringing Assistant to people without internet access",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/google-pay-job-business-india/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""Because I was using it, they've taken it away,"" he said.",The Wire,"New Delhi: A special CBI court on Thursday extended former finance minister P. Chidambaram�s judicial custody till October 3.The 74-year-old senior Congress leader, who was arrested by the investigative agency last month in connection with the controversial INX media case, was sent to judicial remand for 14 days on September 5.Chidambaram�s time in Tihar jail was supposed to end today.On Thursday afternoon, however, the CBI moved an application seeking an extension of judicial custody before the special court at the Rouse Avenue Court Complex.Senior advocate Abishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Chidambaram, argued that �reasonable grounds� must exist for extending judicial custody and that it should only be for four more days if granted.Singhvi also requested the court to order a medical examination of the former finance minister, who has reportedly lost weight over the last two weeks.Responding to these claims, solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that the health of any inmate at Tihar Jail is a concern and that medical care could be given as per the provisions of the law.Chidambaram also told that the court that he had �developed back pain� as he neither had a chair nor a pillow in his cell. While his lawyers were arguing for his release, Chidambaram interrupted to add, �There were chairs outside the room, I used to sit there during the day, now that too is withdrawn. Because I was using it, they have taken it away, now even the warden is without a chair.�Even as Singhvi added that he had a chair �three days ago, now there is no chair, no pillow either�, Mehta called it �a small issue�.�No need to sensationalise it. It�s a petty issue. There was no chair in his room from beginning,� he added.After deliberating over the matter, however, the court decided to extend Chidambaram�s judicial custody until October 3. The senior Congress leader will be allowed to meet his family on a regular basis in this time.Chidambaram�s bail hearing in this matter is expected to be heard by the Delhi high court next week.",https://thewire.in/law/inx-media-case-chidambaram-tihar-jail-october-3?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He was arrested on September 3 after being accused of setting up hawala networks to launder money. A day later, he applied for bail which the ED rejected stating that Shivakumar would �influence witnesses.�KM Nataraj, the Additional Solicitor General representing the ED, stated that Shivakumar and his family members held more than 300 bank accounts altogether and had accused him of laundering over Rs 200 crore in cash.As part of the probe into the case back in 2017, the Income Tax Department found that some transactions made by the party leader were linked to Lakshmi Hebbalkar. Further, when the raids first took place on August 2, 2017, Shivakumar had made a phone call to Lakshmi.She had earlier been issued a summons by the ED to appear on September 14, but was unable to do so.

810,Woman held for daughter's death after giving her heroin to help sleep,A 33-year-old woman has been arrested in the US in connection with the death of her one-year-old daughter for allegedly giving her small doses of heroin over the course of two months to help her sleep. Kimberly Nelligan had also given heroin to her two older children in the past. She's been charged with child endangerment and possession of drugs.,Times Now,"New Delhi: Police in Maine, United States of America, have arrested a woman for allegedly giving her infant daughter small doses of heroin in order to help the child sleep. It is being reported by various media affiliates that these doses of heroin over a period of two months led to the baby's death. Based on statements from eyewitnesses, police have booked 33-year-old Kimberly Nelligan, the deceased child's mother.Nelligan has been charged with child endangerment and possession of drugs. At present, she is facing up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $2,000 for endangering the life of a child and up to 180 days in jail along with $1,000 fine for possession and use of drugs. The woman from Maine continued to showcase remorse even during her visits to the courthouse for the hearing. She was eventually granted bail but ordered to stay away from her husband and any children below 18 years of age.In his statement to the police, Nelligan's husband said that she rubbed heroin residue on their daughter's gums about 15 times over the course of the past two months. According to the medical examiner's office, acute fentanyl intoxication led to the child's death on October 10 of last year. The infant likely digested the drug that killed her, said a report. A potent synthetic opioid prescribed during the treatment of severe pain, fentanyl is also used for capital punishment in America.The Maine mom initially told police officers that she never consumed the drug. However, she later confessed to snorting heroin from time to time around the months surrounding her daughter's death. In addition, Nelligan also told officers probing the matter that she used the drug to put her other children to sleep in the past. The accused's husband confirmed that she rubbed their daughter's gums about 15 times with heroin residue.The mother in her affidavit wrote that she did not hurt her daughter on purpose. However, trouble for Nelligan could rise further with the investigation into the case still underway and police likely to frame more charges against her. District Attorney Marianne Lynch said that laws are not exactly designed to deal with serious and difficult cases such as this. Lynch added that prosecutors are confident of going ahead with the current charges for now and will act accordingly if new allegations emerge against Nelligan.",https://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/crime/article/mother-gives-heroin-to-calm-1-year-old-daughter-arrested-after-child-dies/491553?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

816,Britain heading for a no-deal Brexit: EU,"European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday warned that Britain was headed for a no-deal Brexit. The issue of Irish border, on whether to return to a hard border with security checks and tariffs with the European Union or not, remains unsolved. British PM Boris Johnson has insisted on leaving the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.",Reuters,"STRASBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union warned on Wednesday that Britain was headed for a damaging no-deal Brexit, with London�s ideas for solving the contentious issue of the Irish border still unlikely to unlock a deal just six weeks before Britain is due to leave. Addressing EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him on Monday that London still wanted a deal, but would leave with or without one on Oct. 31. �There is very little time left ... The risk of a no-deal is very real,� said Juncker, his comments weighing on sterling. Pro-Brexit lawmakers cheered and applauded in the Strasbourg chamber.  �It�s time for a clean-break Brexit,� said Brexit campaigner Matthew Patten. Other pro-Brexit EU deputies tried to shout down pro-EU British colleagues, shouting �You lost!� and �Rubbish!� A majority of EU lawmakers later voted for an extension to Britain�s scheduled departure date in a resolution that is not binding but which has political weight. EU leaders will meet for a make-or-break summit in Brussels on Oct. 17-18, just a fortnight before Brexit is due to materialise more than three years after Britons voted to leave. Britain is not likely to present a complete set of detailed, written proposals of how it would want the text of the existing - but stalled - Brexit deal changed before the end of the month, UK and EU sources said. �If that is the case, the summit will end with nothing,� an EU diplomat dealing with Brexit in Brussels said. �If there is to be a deal, it must be prepared to a large extent in advance. It is too technical to leave to the leaders at the last minute.� In a worst-case scenario, a no-deal Brexit could mean severe disruption to trade, supplies of medicines, fresh foods and  possible public disorder, according to the British government�s contingency plans. Such a sharp break in economic ties, ending four decades of EU membership, �might be the United Kingdom�s choice, but never the choice of the EU,� Juncker said, highlighting how the bloc wants to avoid blame if Britain crashes out. Juncker said London must present realistic proposals to replace the Irish backstop arrangement in the Britain-EU divorce agreement, which former premier Theresa May agreed with EU leaders but which was rejected by the British parliament. �I am not emotionally attached to the Irish backstop,� Juncker said. �I have asked the prime minister to make, in writing, alternatives,� he said, calling it a safety net to avoid a divided Ireland after Brexit.  The backstop would require Britain to obey some EU rules if no other way could be found to keep the land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland invisible. Johnson�s office said in a statement late on Wednesday that the British leader had spoken with Juncker and the president of the European Parliament to reassure them that work was underway to find an alternative to the backstop. �The Prime Minister and President Juncker discussed the positive and constructive conversation they had in Luxembourg on Monday and their shared determination to reach a deal,� a spokesperson for Johnson said. But Juncker�s pessimistic tone on Wednesday was echoed by Finland�s minister for European affairs, Tytti Tuppurainen, who told the parliament that a no-deal Brexit �is a quite likely outcome.� Finland holds the EU�s rotating presidency. However, many EU lawmakers warned against a no-deal, both to avoid an economic shock and because they do not want to see Britain abandon its commitments to EU social and environmental standards and become a low-tax, low-regulation rival. �We will not accept a Singapore on the North Sea,� said former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, a liberal EU lawmaker and a member of the parliament�s Brexit committee. In an at times bad-tempered debate underscoring general weariness on the tortured issue of Britain�s pending departure, senior EU lawmakers took jabs at the noisy contingent of British eurosceptic deputies in the chamber. Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right EPP group, called Brexit �stupid�. He and Verhofstadt took aim at British plans for greater sovereignty at a time when the parliament in Westminster has been suspended by Johnson. British pro-EU deputy Julie Ward called the prime minister �disreputable�.  �Brexiteers claimed Westminster would take back control, but now they shut it down,� Weber, a German lawmaker, said in Strasbourg, as the Supreme Court in London continued hearing arguments on whether Johnson acted unlawfully in suspending the parliament in the run-up to Brexit. The European Parliament formally called on Wednesday for Britain to be granted another extension to allow more time for London to agree the terms of its withdrawal.

823,Google Assistant to be available to Indian users without internet,"At its 'Google for India' event on Thursday, the company announced its virtual assistant will also be available to people who have the most basic cellphone with no internet access. A 24×7 telephone line on Vodafone-Idea telecom networks could be dialled by users to access the service. Google said it's been testing the line in Lucknow and Kanpur.",TechCrunch,"Google  Assistant, the digital assistant from the global search giant, is available to users through their smartphones, laptops and smart speakers. Earlier this year, the company partnered with KaiOS to bring Assistant to some feature phones with internet access. Now Google is going a step further: Bringing its virtual assistant to people who have the most basic cell phone with no internet access. It�s starting this program in India.At an event in New Delhi on Thursday, the company announced a 24�7 telephone line that anyone in India on Vodafone and Idea telecom networks (or Vodafone-Idea telecom network, as Vodafone owns Idea) could dial to have their questions answered. The company said it tested the phone line service with thousands of users across Lucknow and Kanpur before making it generally available.Users will be able to dial 000-800-9191-000 and they won�t be charged for the call or the service. Manuel Bronstein, a VP at Google, said through this program the company is hoping to reach hundreds of millions of users in India who currently don�t have access to smartphones or internet.Even as there are more than 500 million users with access to internet and about 450 million with smartphones in India, more than half of the nation�s 1.3 billion people remains unconnected.India has emerged as one of the last great growth markets for Silicon Valley companies that are looking to find their next billion users worldwide. But to reach these users, companies are required to put in some extra work: build and customize services to address the local challenges.On Wednesday, Amazon said its digital assistant service Alexa now understands and speaks Hindi. Only 10% of India�s 1.3 billion people speak English. There are over half a billion people in India who speak Hindi, however. Google said today that Hindi had already become the second most popular language for its digital assistant service.Google also unveiled a new Google Assistant feature called interpreter mode that will serve as a real-time translator between two people speaking different languages. Google said the feature would support translation between English and Hindi and will roll out in the coming months.Google Assistant, which supports nine Indian languages, now also allows users to ask their commands in a language that is not set as their preferred device language. �Many users often prefer to set the phone language to English, while choosing to speak to their device in their local language. That�s where language decoupling comes in � Indian users can now simply ask to change their Assistant language,� the company said.�Starting today, you can talk to your Assistant in the nine Indian languages for example, for talking in Hindi �you can simply say �Hey Google, talk to me in Hindi� to start using the Assistant in the language, without needing to dig around in settings.�Google chases businesses to maintain its payments lead in India",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/google-assistant-no-internet-india/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

827,"Lyft faces lawsuit that alleges kidnapping at gunpoint, rape","US ride-hailing giant Lyft is facing another lawsuit pertaining to its handling of alleged sexual assaults by drivers on its platform. The lawsuit alleged that the plaintiff's driver kidnapped her at gunpoint and she was raped by the driver and other men. ""Alison remembers the men cheering and high-fiving each other as they continued to rape her,"" the lawsuit claimed.",TechCrunch,"Lyft  is facing another lawsuit pertaining to its handling of alleged sexual assaults at the hands of drivers on its platform. In a suit filed today in the San Francisco Superior Court, Alison Turkos accuses Lyft of 11 counts, including general negligence, vicarious liability for assault with a deadly weapon, sexual assault, sexual battery and breach of contract.The lawsuit describes how the plaintiff�s Lyft driver allegedly kidnapped her at gunpoint and took her across state lines, where the driver and other men took turns raping her, the lawsuits states.�Alison remembers the men cheering and high fiving each other as they continued to rape her,� the lawsuit alleges. �Their attack was so brutal that the next day Alison experienced severe vaginal pain and bleeding. Her body was so exhausted from the attack and resulting trauma that Alison could not even leave her bed or raise her arms.�When the plaintiff reported it to Lyft, the lawsuit alleges Lyft simply apologized for �inconvenience� and gave her a partial refund for the ride. Lyft, however, says the incident was not initially reported as a safety incident, but rather as an indirect route issue. Lyft says it did not become aware of the incident until May 2018, when the Wall Street Journal ran a piece on it.�What this rider describes is awful, and something no one should have to endure,� a Lyft spokesperson told TechCrunch. �The unfortunate fact remains that one in six women will face some form of sexual violence in their lives � behavior that�s unacceptable for our society and on our platform. In this case, the driver passed the New York City TLC�s background check and was permitted to drive.�The spokesperson added, �We constantly work to improve the platform, which is why we have invested in new features, protocols and policies to protect our riders and drivers. This year alone we�ve launched 14 new safety features � including daily continuous background check monitoring, in-app emergency assistance, and mandatory feedback for any ride rated less than four stars.�The plaintiff says she reported the crime to the police, who performed a rape kit that found evidence of semen from at least two men on the clothing she wore that night.The New York Police Department then transferred the case to the FBI, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit states the FBI is now investigating the incident as a human trafficking case. However, Lyft �has been wholly uncooperative� throughout the NYPD and FBI�s investigation, the lawsuit alleges.In May 2018, Lyft says it received a subpoena from law enforcement and worked with law enforcement for over a year during the investigation.The lawsuit seeks special damages, including economic restitution to cover past and future hospital expenses, as well as expenses relating to her profession and loss of earning capacity.�By failing to take reasonable steps to confront the problem of multiple rapes and sexual assaults of LYFT passengers by LYFT drivers, LYFT has acted in conscious disregard of the safety of its passengers,� the lawsuit alleges.This suit comes just weeks after 14 women filed suit against Lyft alleging the company has not addressed complaints pertaining to sexual assault. Both suits recommended Lyft adopt new policies, such as the addition to the app of a surveillance camera that can record audio and video of all rides.Meanwhile, Lyft recently announced new safety features, including trip check-ins if a ride seems to be taking longer than it should and in-app 911 calling.�We�re committed to playing a significant role in connecting our communities with transportation, and we understand the responsibilities that come along with that,� Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer wrote in a blog post. �We�ve known since the beginning that as part of our mission, we must heavily invest in safety. We continue to welcome accountability and partnership to best protect our rider and driver community.�It�s no coincidence that Lyft announced these safety features in light of the lawsuit on behalf of those 14 women. The company had previously taken some steps to address safety, but at a much slower pace than competitor Uber, which has also faced a number of sexual assault and abuse lawsuits. Between 2014-2018, CNN found 103 Uber drivers�who had been accused of sexual assault or abuse of passengers.Over the years,�both companies have taken steps to ramp up their respective safety procedures. In April, Uber launched a campus safety initiative while Lyft implemented continuous background checks and enhanced its identity verification process for drivers. Uber, however, implemented continuous background checks about a full year before Lyft, and added an in-app 911 calling feature more than a year before Lyft.�We don�t take lightly any instances where someone�s safety is compromised, especially in the rideshare industry, including the allegations of assault in the news last week,� Zimmer said earlier this month in that same blog post. �The reality is that certain populations carry a disproportionate burden simply trying to get to work or back home after a night out � in the U.S., one in six women will face some form of sexual violence in their lives. The onus is on all of us to learn from any incident, whether it occurs on our platform or not, and then work to help prevent them.�",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/lyft-faces-lawsuit-that-alleges-kidnapping-at-gunpoint-and-rape/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Warning of an �epidemic� among young people, India banned sale, production, import and advertising of e-cigarettes, dealing a blow to plans of companies such as Philip Morris International and Juul Labs to sell the products in India. Websites such as Vapestop and Litejoy, which offered vaping products online, discontinued their operations and ran disclaimers related to the government order.

""This policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel,"" Instagram said.",Engadget,"You'll soon see fewer ads for ""flat tummy"" tea and lip fillers on Instagram. The social media platform announced today that it is tightening restrictions on posts related to diet products and cosmetic surgery. The new rules -- first reported in the London Evening Standard -- will apply to both Facebook and Instagram, and will result in age restrictions being applied to some posts and other posts being removed entirely.The social media platforms will ban posts promoting dubious weight loss products that are linked to a commercial offer (like a discount code). Furthermore, both will restrict users who are under 18 years old from viewing content that promote the use of certain weight loss products and cosmetic procedures.Instagram's public policy manager, Emma Collins, said in an interview with the London Evening Standard that the platform worked with external experts to make this change without ruining the spirit of Instagram. ""We want Instagram to be a positive place for everyone that uses it and this policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel as a result of social media,"" said Collins.Dr. Ysabel Gerrard, a professor at the University of Sheffield and one of the outside experts Instagram consulted prior to the change, tweeted that she worked with a team of academics, activists and practitioners, including actress Jameela Jamil. According to Gerrard, Instagram will remove posts that make a ""miraculous claim"" about a diet or weight loss product. Users will also be able to report posts they believe are in violation of the rules.""Miraculous claims means they aren't sustainable. Products like skinny teas, these have been publicly criticised as they offer short term solutions to something that naturally takes a lot longer. It's hard to blame social media solely for influencing eating disorders, but the content we see on social media is a contributing factor to how we feel about our bodies,"" said Gerrard in an interview with the London Evening Standard.Gerrard told Engadget that she does anticipate pushback from companies that hawk such products over the policy change. ""I do anticipate pushback from companies or individuals who sell these products, but they must act responsibly and re-shape their products and marketing techniques to optimise people's safety,"" said Gerrard in a direct message on Twitter. She also added that she did not get paid for her work with Instagram.Numerous studies have suggested that Instagram may be a contributing factor to eating disorders and depression among teenagers. The social media platform has also been blamed for a rise in interest in plastic surgery -- such as fillers and Botox -- among younger individuals.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/18/instagram-will-restrict-posts-on-cosmetic-surgery-and-diet-prod/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Meanwhile, Manchester City defeated Shakhtar Donetsk 3-0, while Juventus were held to a 2-2 draw by Atletico Madrid. On Tuesday, defending champions Liverpool suffered a 0-2 defeat at the hands of Napoli.",Reuters,"PARIS (Reuters) - Angel Di Maria scored twice in a vintage performance to help Paris St Germain outclass Real Madrid 3-0 in their opening Champions League Group A game on Wednesday. In the absence of the formidable attacking trio of Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Edinson Cavani, Di Maria provided two first-half goals as PSG suffocated Real throughout and Thomas Meunier added a third in stoppage time. Real, European champions 13 times and three years in a row from 2016-18, failed to muster a shot on target and suffered their first defeat of the season. PSG lead the standings on three points, ahead of Club Brugge and Galatasaray, who played out a goalless draw earlier on Wednesday. �We lacked intensity, we never got into the game, we created very few chances,� Real coach Zinedine Zidane told a news conference. Although PSG�s win could be seen as a statement, the French champions still have a long way to go before putting three consecutive last-16 eliminations behind them for good including last season�s embarrassing defeat by Manchester United. �We played at a very very high level tonight, but it�s not easy to show this in every game,� said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. With Neymar suspended and Mbappe and Cavani injured, Argentine Mauro Icardi started up front after playing his first half hour for PSG in a Ligue 1 game against Strasbourg last weekend. He had little impact, though, as Di Maria made sure his compatriot�s lack of match time went unnoticed in PSG�s first European game since a shock 3-1 home defeat by United sent them out of last season�s Champions League.  Eden Hazard started for Real, who eliminated PSG in the last 16 in 2017-18, and they were also without the injured Marcelo, Isco, Luka Modric, Marco Asensio and Fede Valverde as well as the suspended Sergio Ramos and Nacho Fernandez. PSG started fast and were rewarded for their early domination in the 14th minute when Di Maria stabbed the ball past Thibaut Courtois at the near post from Juan Bernat�s cross. It was former Real player Di Maria�s 25th goal in his 100th appearance in European competition. He made it 26 in the 33rd minute, curling a superb shot past Courtois from 20 metres after Idrissa Gueye had cut through the Real midfield. Real forward Gareth Bale found the back of the net shortly afterwards but the goal was ruled out by the VAR for handball. PSG left little space to Real and Di Maria came close to making it 3-0, only for his chip to land on the roof of the net after the Argentine had been sent through by the impressive Gueye. Real striker Karim Benzema beat Keylor Navas from close range in the 77th minute, but the goal was ruled out because Lucas Vazquez was offside. Full back Meunier wrapped up an emphatic win when he scored from close range one minute into stoppage time following a PSG counter-attack.

People of Kashmir should be treated with respect, Malik further said.",The Financial Express,"Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Wednesday said that instead of taking over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) by force, the development in Jammu and Kashmir should prompt the people on the other side of Line of Control (LoC) to �revolt� and join India.Addressing a function here, Malik said that some ministers have been talking about taking back PoK from Pakistan by force.�I have been seeing from the past 10 to 15 days that many of our ministers, who do not get to talk on international matters, have been repeatedly talking about invading PoK, taking it back etc. My belief is that if PoK is the next target, we can take it on the basis on the development of Jammu and Kashmir.�If we can give love and respect to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and secure the future of their children, bring development and prosperity, I can guarantee that within a year or so there will be a revolt in PoK and you will get it without a confrontation � the residents of PoK will on their own say that they want to come this side.

The aim of the scheme was to regularise illegal occupants while generating funds for construction of power projects in the state.Malik said the government has taken steps to ensure uninterrupted power supply to Jammu and Srinagar cities from this winter.The governor thanked Union Power Minister R K Singh, who was also present in the function, for his generous support to the power sector in the state.�At my request, he (Singh) has reduced the time for laying of Leh-Nubra transmission line from three years to 18 months,� he added.The governor and the Union minister inaugurated 15 power projects in Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh and laid the foundation stone for another 20 projects in these regions of the state that was bifurcated into two union territories on August 5.Singh, in his address, stressed that the power supply in this winter will be much better than in the past.�We will spend time in Jammu in December and January to experience and observe the situation � our goal is to provide 24 hours electricity supply to all the citizens of the country, including Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh,� he said.Singh said the regions have the potential to generate enough hydel power, not only be self-sufficient but also to export it to other states.�This will enhance the per capita income of the state like it did in Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand,� he added.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market�s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

897,Saudi displays evidence of attack by Iran on its oil plants,"Saudi Arabia on Wednesday displayed wreckage of drones and missiles it said were used in the attacks on two of its oil facilities, calling them ""undeniable"" evidence of Iran's involvement in the attacks. A total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks launched from Iran, Saudi Arabia said. Yemen-based Houthi rebels had claimed responsibility for the attacks.",RT,"Speaking to the press on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Saudi Ministry of Defense displayed what he said was wreckage from the projectiles used in the strikes on petrol plants in Abqaiq and Khurais last weekend.The type of weapons used proved that the assault �could not have originated in Yemen,� Colonel Turki al-Maliki claimed. He said the capabilities of the drones and the cruise missiles have been known to Riyadh from previous attacks.Accusing Iran of sponsoring the attack, the spokesman called on other countries to �acknowledge Iran's malign activities in the region.�The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran.He also presented surveillance footage from one of the oil facilities, claiming it depicted a drone in flight, though the UAV was difficult to make out in the video.It wasn�t clear where precisely the attack originated, al-Maliki admitted. He said the government was �working to know exactly the launch point.�The press conference came just as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Jeddah, where he is scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the attacks.Yemen�s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the drone and missile strikes on Saturday, which caused a severe disruption in global oil markets and sent prices soaring upward by nearly 20 percent. The damaged refinery in Abqaiq was among the world�s largest oil processing facilities, while the Khurais plant sits on the country�s second largest oil field.The missile used in the attack could be a copy of the Soviet-designed cruise missile Kh-55, which Iran acquired from Ukraine and then developed into its own weapon, a military analyst and retired army officer Viktor Murakhovsky told RT.However, this does not qualify as definitive proof that Iran launched such an attack, Murakhovsky said. It is �hardly a secret� that Iran sells weapons to the Yemeni Houthi rebels, he explained, adding that Tehran has spoken in support of Yemen�s right of self-defense.Moreover, it is not difficult for Houthi forces to launch a cruise missile, so their responsibility cannot be ruled out.�You do not need a narrow-focus specialist in order to use this missile. You need to input the launch mission data and carry out the launch, that�s all,� Murakhovsky said.Doubling down on their claim of responsibility, the Houthis on Wednesday said that the strikes were launched from �three positions,� and added that the drones used would be �revealed today for the first time.�Meanwhile, Tehran officials have dismissed the arguments presented at the Saudi press-conference as inconclusive.The Saudi press conference was a �media disaster� for the country, said Hesameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, arguing the kingdom could not prove �what area and point [the strikes] were fired from,� or �why the air defense failed to thwart the attack.�Like this story?

He will replace John Bolton, who was fired by Trump earlier this month.",RT,"Trump announced O�Brien�s nomination on Wednesday, saying that he has �worked long and hard with Robert.�O�Brien replaces John Bolton, the hawkish interventionist sacked last week. Bolton was a proponent of military intervention in Iran, Venezuela, Syria, and North Korea, and Trump had reportedly complained that Bolton was actively trying to drag him into conflict. Announcing his dismissal, Trump said that he �strongly disagreed� with many of Bolton�s positions.O�Brien is a lesser known name in foreign policy circles, and is currently serving as the special envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department. Though more used to overseeing the release of hostages from conflict zones, O�Brien was sent by Trump to Sweden in July, to try to secure the release of rapper A$AP Rocky, who was jailed for an alleged assault in Stockholm.The negotiations failed, and Rocky was jailed before eventually being released pending a verdict.O�Brien set forth his foreign policy beliefs in his 2016 book �While America Slept.� In it, he called for a strengthening of America�s military alliances, the relevance of which Trump has questioned in the past, and an aggressive posture against China.The diplomat also compared the Obama administration�s signing of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran to appeasing Nazi Germany. Given Trump�s promise on Wednesday to �substantially increase� sanctions on Tehran, O�Brien�s hiring likely signals no thaw in relations with the Islamic Republic.Subscribe to RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won�t tell you.",https://www.rt.com/news/469085-trump-names-robert-c-obrien/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Awan also serves as the Prime Minister's Special Assistant on Information and Broadcasting.",ANI,"Islamabad [Pakistan], Sept 18 (ANI): Pakistan's sham crackdown on terrorism was exposed yet again after a photo surfaced on social media showing ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) top political leaders sharing a stage with US-designated terrorist Maulana Fazlur Rehman Khalil.The photo, which was shared by, journalist Asif Shahzad, is from All Parties Kashmir Solidarity Conference which was held in Islamabad on September 16.The conference was attended by President of Pakistan occupied Kashmir Masood Khan and Prime Minister's Special Assistant on Information and Broadcasting Firdous Ashiq Awan among other prominent leaders. However, the presence of Khalil, a PTI leader and founder of the terrorist organisation Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), in the event meant to garner support for Kashmir was questionable.India has long blamed Pakistan for fuelling terror and supporting terrorist groups in Jammu and Kashmir to create unrest in the region. Imran Khan's party, which rose to power with a promise to not provide safe haven to terrorists, has been often blamed for supporting terrorist groups. Khan has been infamous as Taliban Khan for his staunch support to the terrorist group. Khalil's organization HuM, is said to have been in direct contact with Osama Bin Laden and his family when he was in Abbottabad and has been on the US State department's foreign terrorist organization list since 1997. Khalil has been a strong supporter of Imran Khan and advocated for the latter's candidature as the Prime Minister of the country last year. In March, Khan government received a lot of backlash for including of Khahil into the party. The photo has emerged weeks before the crucial Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meeting where Pakistan's compliance with the action plan will be assessed and it fears blacklisting. Pakistan has been under the FATF radar for its complicity towards terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) among others. In addition, terrorists like Hafiz Saeed are regularly seen ranting anti-India rhetoric and collecting so-called donations.The FATF recently gave a stern message to Pakistan to expedite its action plan for curbing terror financing by October or face the prospect of getting blacklisted, which could aggravate problems for its stagnant economy.

The company announced Tuesday that it will partner with law enforcement in the US and UK to obtain footage from their firearms training programs. Data from those videos should help Facebook's systems detect real-world, first-person footage of violent events.According to Financial Times, Facebook will provide the UK's Metropolitan Police with body cameras at no cost. In exchange, Facebook will have access to that data, which it will also share with the UK Home Office. The company is reportedly in talks with US law enforcement about a similar partnership.Facebook was criticized this spring when, after the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, footage from the attack was available on Facebook for weeks following the event. Part of the problem, Facebook said, is that it did not have enough content depicting first-person footage of violent events to train its machine learning technology. Facebook hopes footage from the police training programs will allow it to improve its automatic detection systems. By making those systems more accurate, Facebook may also reduce the likelihood that it will mistakenly remove violent scenes from fictional content, like movies or video games.Facebook says some of the changes it has made to combat hate and terrorism predate the Chirstchurch shooting. ""But that attack, and the global response to it in the form of the Christchurch Call to Action, has strongly influenced the recent updates to our policies and their enforcement,"" Facebook wrote in a press release.

However, the Centre faced a lot of backlash from opposition parties and people from the southern part of India where Hindi is not a widely-spoken language.This drew the ire of the DMK-ruled Tamil Nadu government that announced state-wide protests on September 20 condemning the �Hindi imposition�. �This meet urges the Centre to give up the imposition of Hindi language immediately and engage itself in useful activities that will develop the nation,� the DMK said in a statement, according to news agency PTI.Former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, who is currently under trial and is lodged in the Tihar jail in the INX Media money laundering case, also voiced his displeasure with it and urged the people of Tamil Nadu to join the DMK in its protest.�A dangerous idea that Hindi alone can unite the people of this country has been floated. The Tamil people, as well as all others who speak other languages, will never allow the imposition of Hindi. We support the development of all languages, but we will never accept the idea that Hindi alone will unite the people of this country. I urge the TNCC president KS Alagiri to ask all Congress workers to join the state-wide protest announced by the DMK on 20.09.2019 to oppose the imposition of Hindi,� Chidambaram said in a tweet posted by his family from his official Twitter account.

Earlier in the day, actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth, after Kamal Haasan, expressed their displeasure with the Home Minister�s remark to make Hindi a national language, with Rajinikanth saying that �no one will accept the imposition of Hindi, especially in Tamil Nadu and southern India�. �No Shah, Sultan or Samrat should renege on that promise. We respect all languages but our mother language will always be Tamil,� Kamal Haasan had said on Monday.�India is a country of different languages and every language has its own significance. But it is important to have a language for the whole country, which should become the identity of India in the world. Today, if one language can do the work of unifying the country, then it's Hindi, the most spoken language,� Shah had said in a series of tweets.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/dmk-workers-blacken-hindi-text-at-tamil-nadu-station-chidambaram-calls-imposition-of-hindi-dangerous-idea/491006?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

So, you see that algorithms are used to control, monitor and discipline workers,� she says.She added, �Workers often express feeling cheated regarding work conditions, which have an adverse effect on earnings.� In countries like Spain and UK, food delivery workers are fighting legal battles to have platforms recognise them as employees and are rejecting the label of ""partners"".

But they are not independent at all. Companies dodge themselves from providing minimum facilities that any employee can possess. They are pushed to long working hours and gruelling work conditions. There are strict control and supervision over the hours and location of their work and there is no job security.

The first video of the unidentified object was taken in 2004, while the second and third videos were taken in 2015. The US Navy refused to give details about the locations the videos were shot in.",RT,"Three widely-circulated clips depicting military aircraft interacting with UFOs � mysterious objects performing maneuvers not possible using existing aviation technology � were never supposed to be released to the public, the Navy�s Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare spokesman Joseph Gradisher told the Black Vault earlier this month, but the videos are genuine � and their contents can�t be explained.�The Navy designates the objects contained in these videos as unidentified aerial phenomena� (UAP), Gradisher said, explaining that UAP is used instead of UFO as the �basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges.�Translated into English: we don�t know what they are, but there�s no evidence they�re alien in origin.One clip (�FLIR1�) shows a dark, pill-shaped object hovering for several seconds before scooting sideways extremely fast. Another (�GoFast�) shows the observing aircraft�s sensor lock onto a fast-moving target as the pilots are heard in the background excitedly wondering what exactly they�ve stumbled across. The third (�Gimbal�) shows an oblong object moving steadily before stopping and rotating as the pilots observing it exclaim in surprise.The videos were released to Luis Elizondo � a former military intelligence officer who claims to have directed the Pentagon�s UFO research arm, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program � in 2017, for use in a database about aerial threats. While declassified, they were not cleared for general public use.Since then, the videos have made their way to the New York Times and To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, a consortium of former intelligence officers, scientists, and celebrities promoting the investigation of UFOs and other �scientific mysteries.� The Pentagon complained, stating earlier this year that the videos �should still be withheld� as they were �never officially released to the general public,� but it�s a bit too late to put the unidentified flying cat back in the bag.The Navy set up guidelines earlier this year for reporting �unidentified aircraft� entering US airspace, ensuring no encounter would go undocumented in response to a plethora of reports, and lawmakers have reportedly requested briefings on the issue as the Pentagon�s history of chasing UFOs under secretive programs like AATIP has become public knowledge.Think your friends would be interested?

978,Legalise betting to curb corruption in cricket: BCCI's ACU chief,"BCCI's Anti-Corruption Unit chief Ajit Singh Shekhawat has said that betting should be legalised to curb corruption in cricket. ""Legal betting will be done under some parameters and it can be controlled. It will also bring a huge amount of revenue for the government, close to what the excise department generates,"" he added.",Cricket Country,"The BCCI�s Anti-Corruption Unit chief Ajit Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday suggested a match-fixing law, besides legalisation of betting, to tackle corruption in Indian cricket.ALSO READ: Committee appointed to enquire into reports of match-fixing in TNPLShekhawat, who was the Director General of Police in Rajasthan before taking charge of BCCI�s Anti-corruption Unit in April 2018, gave his suggestions in an interview to PTI. This was after 12 cricketers, including national and international, reported corrupt approaches in the last one year, the Tamil Nadu Premier League came under scanner for suspect activity and a woman cricketer reported an approach from a bookie.READ: TNPL match-fixing: Coach previously associated with IPL franchise and a Ranji team under scannerIn the light of cases emerging from the leagues of Mumbai, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu this year, has match-fixing or spot fixing become unstoppable in the country?�It is not unstoppable. We probably require a law against it, a match-fixing law. If there is a clear law against it, police will also have a clear cut role,� Shekhawat said.ALSO READ: Indian woman cricketer approached for match-fixing during England series, BCCI ACU files FIRLast year, the Law Commission of India had expressed the need to make match-fixing a criminal offence, like it is in England and Australia. Legalised betting is another way to deal with corruption in the game, explained Shekhawat.�May be there could be a thinking about legalising gambling so that all this illegal business which goes on can be controlled. Legal betting will be done under some parameters and it can be controlled,� he said. �It will also bring a huge amount of revenue for the government, close to what the excise department generates. The amount of money which is bet on sports is mindboggling.�He said a move like this would also help keep a tab on the people involved as well as the money.�Revenue is not the only consideration, there could be other issues which the government has in mind. I am not saying categorically that it should be legalised but it should be considered. It could be regulated when it is legalised, right now it is totally illegal.�Once it is legalised you will also get the data on who is betting and how much is he betting. And while doing that, make illegal betting tougher. Right now you can get away with a fine of few hundreds or a few thousands,� he said.Men�s cricket has been prone to corruption for long but now even the women�s game is not immune to the menace. In February, an India women�s cricketer reported a corrupt approach to the BCCI, prompting the ICC to conduct an inquiry. On Monday, an FIR was lodged against two individuals in the matter.�Anything which is given wide publicity, which is telecast live, it lends itself to betting and once something lends itself to betting then it could be anything. If they find out that it is getting tough to make headway in men�s cricket, they may try to go to women�s cricket,� he pointed out.�If that is also tough, they may try the state leagues and if that is also proving to be tough, they may they have their own league like it was in the case of Rajputana league.�Since Shekhawat took charge, the BCCI ACU has witnessed some wholesale changes in its functioning. The department has more staff now, eight personnel to be precise, and it plans to recruit 5-6 more in the near future.�This is the first time we have totally taken over the anti-corruption of the state run leagues. It is also the first time our officials are staying at the team hotels to keep a watch on the players.�We also organise anti-corruption classes for the participants. We tell them what anti-corruption code is, what the penalties are and what are the responsibilities cast upon each of the participants,� he explained. �Like when an approach is made, it is incumbent upon the participant to report it. If he doesn�t report it, it is an offence and he could be penalised. Due to anti-corruption classes, the players have started reporting approaches.�",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/betting-should-be-legalised-to-curb-corruption-in-indian-cricket-bccis-acu-chief-892392?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

979,Mamata meeting PM Modi to save Rajeev Kumar: Vijayvargiya,"BJP General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said that West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a ""last-ditch effort"" to save former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar. The CBI is looking for Rajeev Kumar in the Saradha chit fund case. On Tuesday, a district and sessions court had rejected Kumar's pre-arrest bail plea.",The Financial Express,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Tuesday took a dig at West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee who is slated to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi tomorrow. He claimed that the Trinamool Congress chief is meeting the PM in �a last-ditch effort� to save former Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar. The last time that both leaders had met was at a convocation ceremony at Shantiniketan�s Visva Bharati University on May 25 last year. During the general elections earlier this year, Banerjee had refused to meet Modi when the state was under cyclone threat saying she would meet the next PM after polls as elections were underway.Vijayvargiya said that Banerjee knew well that Kumar�s arrest would lead half of her ministers behind bars in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam. The TMC in its response to Vijayavargiya termed his claims as baseless, saying that the CM was within her rights to meet the Prime Minister to discuss issues related to development of the state.In recent times, a number of Trinamool leaders and former city top cop Rajeev Kumar have been under the scanner of the CBI in the Saradha scam. With Kumar still not ready to appear before the CBI, days after Calcutta High Court vacated its previous interim order that gave Kumar protection from arrest in the case, the CBI has moved a Basirhat court seeking a non-bailable warrant against him. Currently serving as West Bengal CID Additional Director General, Kumar was part of a Special Investigation Team that was formed by the state government to probe the scam, before the case was handed over to the CBI in 2014.The Saradha group allegedly duped lakhs of people of close to Rs 2500 crore, promising a higher return on investing.Also read: Mamata Banerjee describes her scheduled meeting with PM Modi as �courtesy� one; says will focus on issues related to WBThe CBI�s attempts to question Rajeev Kumar have previously resulted in a major political battle between the Centre and the TMC. Earlier this year when a CBI team landed at Kumar�s official residence to probe him in the case, the ex-top cop was not found. Some of the sleuths were taken into custody as they had allegedly come without proper documents. However, they were soon let off.

985,Air pollutants inhaled by mother found on unborn babies' placentas,"Belgium's Hasselt University researchers have found air pollution particles on the foetal side of the placenta, confirming that black carbon inhaled by mothers can cross into unborn children. The study comprised 28 placentas from non-smoking women in the town of Hasselt. The particle pollution levels were below the EU limit but above the WHO limit.",Reuters,"(Reuters Health) - Airborne carbon particles that can cause health problems in adults and children are getting into the placenta as it nourishes a developing fetus, a new study has found. Tissue samples from 5 pre-term and 23 full-term births found that the more airborne soot the mother was exposed to during pregnancy, the higher the number of so-called black carbon particles found in the placenta, researchers report in Nature Communications. In addition to transferring oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the fetus, the placenta is supposed to be a barrier � albeit not a perfect one � that protects the fetus from substances that might harm it. Dr. Frank Gilliland of the University of Southern California�s Keck School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, characterized the findings as �pretty remarkable.� �Our results demonstrate that the human placental barrier is not impenetrable for particles,� said the team, led by Tim Nawrot of Hasselt University in Belgium. Whether those particles, created by the combustion of fossil fuels, pose a direct risk to the fetus is an unresolved question. But the researchers speculate that the pollutants may play a role in the low birth weight or premature delivery more  often seen in babies whose mothers are exposed to higher levels of contaminated air. �This builds on a growing body of evidence that these particles are actually absorbed and distributed throughout the human body, said Dr. Gilliland, a professor of preventive medicine in Keck�s Division of Environmental Medicine. �We know the fetus is in a vulnerable state so these things sitting there in the placenta can�t be good,� he said. �They may be inert, but the chances are they are playing a role in some of the adverse effects regarding growth and development that we see in particulate pollution.� �It opens up a whole additional line of research to understand the effects these particles are having on the fetus,� he said. Such particles have been known to slow cognitive abilities, and they�ve been seen in the urine of healthy children and in the brain at autopsy. The Nawrot team found the black carbon (BC) particles on both sides of the placentas, regardless of whether the baby was born early.  �Further research will have to show whether the particles can cross the placenta and reach the fetus, and if particle translocation is responsible for the observed adverse health effects during early life,� the researchers said. Nawrot did not respond to requests for comment. SOURCE: bit.ly/2mfw5ZH Nature Communications, online September 17, 2019.

He added that state oil giant Aramco had emerged ""like a phoenix from the ashes"". Aramco shut down 5.7 million barrels per day of oil output, which is over half of Saudi's production.",Reuters,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will restore its lost oil production by the end of September and has managed to recover supplies to customers to the levels they were at prior to weekend attacks on its facilities by drawing from its huge oil inventories.  Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that average oil production in September and October would be 9.89 million barrels per day and that the world�s top oil exporter would ensure full oil supply commitments to its customers this month. �Over the past two days we have contained the damage and restored more than half of the production that was down as a result of the terrorist attack,� Prince Abdulaziz told a news conference in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. He said the kingdom would achieve 11 million bpd capacity by end of September and 12 million bpd by end of November.  �Oil supplies will be returned to the market as they were before 3:43 a.m. Saturday,� he said, adding that state oil giant Aramco had emerged �like a phoenix from the ashes� after the attack. He was referring to attacks on Saturday on state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco�s plants in Abqaiq and Khurais, including the world�s largest oil processing facility, which shut down 5.7 million barrels per day, which is more than half of Saudi Arabia�s production, or 5% of global output. Aramco�s Chief Executive Amin Nasser said the company, which is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), was still in the process of estimating repair work but that it was �not that significant,� given the company�s size. �We should be at our production (level) before the attacks on our facility by the end of September,� Nasser told the same news conference.  Aramco had put out 10 fires in the span of seven hours after the �huge� assault, Nasser said. He said the company was in the process of bringing back oil refining to full capacity and that there were enough crude products to supply the local markets. Aramco�s crude oil inventories are more than 60 million barrels, he said. Speaking at the same news conference, Aramco�s Chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan, said Aramco�s IPO would be ready within the coming 12 months and that the kingdom was committed to the listing. Rumayyan said the IPO would �continue as it is� despite weekend attacks and that timing would depend on market conditions. Prince Abdulaziz said Riyadh did not yet know who carried out the strikes or why, adding Saudi Arabia would keep its role as a secure supplier of global markets. He said stricter measures needed to be taken to prevent further attacks, but did not elaborate. The foreign ministry has said that preliminary investigations indicated Iranian weapons were used in the assault, which authorities initially said involved drones.

1006,Facebook to form content Oversight Board that can overrule CEO Mark,"Facebook has unveiled its plans to form an independent content Oversight Board comprising 40 people globally. The new rules will let users appeal content decisions directly to the board instead of through Facebook's usual channels. ""The board's decision will be binding, even if I or anyone at Facebook disagrees with it,"" Facebook Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.",Engadget,"Facebook has unveiled the finished charter for its content oversight board, and it's evident that the social site wants to give the board at least some meaningful independence.  The new rules will let users appeal content decisions directly to the board instead of through Facebook's usual channels, and any decisions will be binding no matter who at Facebook disagrees with it, according to Mark Zuckerberg.  The charter also outlines how Facebook intends to keep the board independent throughout the overall process, and how it will choose and work on cases.The board will be chosen from qualified and vetted candidates ""outside of our normal channels,"" including through a recommendation portal that will let anyone suggest candidates.  There will also be an in-between trust that oversees pay and other day-to-day operations.  You'll see at least 11 members (Facebook wants 40) with each serving a maximum of three terms of three years apiece.  They'll be chosen on a range of criteria that includes not just relevant experience, but open-mindedness and impartiality.  It wants people from a wide range of cultural, political and religious backgrounds.The board will have a specific process for handling cases.  A rotating case selection committee will choose cases to recommend, with at least one of them from the region where the complaint came from.  The board will choose the cases themselves, but general staff will choose the panel and case manager.  It'll be up to the board and its staff to determine if more research is needed.  Facebook will just be there to supply information when requested.  Draft decisions from the panel will be circulated to the whole board, which can call for a fresh review if a majority objects to the outcome.All decisions will go into a database that will serve as precedent for future decisions, much like traditional court systems.The oversight board won't hear cases until the first half of 2020, although you should hear about its first members before 2019 is over.If all goes according to plan, the board should help Facebook settle disputes over controversial decisions in a more educated and objective fashion.  As TechCrunch mentioned, though, this could also help Facebook's leadership wash its hands of responsibility if a decision proves unpopular or leads to regulatory trouble -- don't blame us, it's the board's fault.  Facebook can also decide just how broadly to apply the precedents set by case decisions, so the outcome may not always sync with expectations.  Even so, it's a start that could help it address the many, many disputes that have come up over the years.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/facebook-content-oversight-board-charter/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

All factions in parliament agreed the revision at a plenary session on Monday, according to a statement on its website.  Indonesia is among the 10 countries in the world with the highest number of child brides, according to campaign group Girls Not Brides. One in four girls in Indonesia is married before they turn 18, according to a 2016 report by Indonesia�s Statistics Agency and the United Nations children�s fund UNICEF.  �The society still encourages girls to get married in their teenage years, otherwise they will be considered spinsters,� said Masruchah of the National Commission on Violence Against Women. Masruchah, who uses one name, said the commission would have preferred 21 as the minimum age for marriage for men and women, when both are considered mature in terms of reproduction and economic stability. Indonesia previously allowed girls of 16 to get married or younger � with no minimum age � if their parents requested it.  Indonesia�s Constitutional Court ruled in December that it was discriminatory to have a lower marriage age for women than for men, who could legally marry at 19.

Mongia last represented his domestic side Punjab in 2007 before joining the now-defunct Indian Cricket League.",CricTracker,"Former India batsman Dinesh Mongia has called time on his cricket career on September 17, 2019. Mongia is best remembered for being picked over VVS Laxman in the Indian squad for the ICC World Cup 2003 in South Africa, where the Men in Blue ended up as runners-up, after being defeated by Australia in the finals.Mongia, who hailed from Punjab, made his debut for the state in 1995-96, was a prolific run-getter in the domestic circuit. The left-handed batsman was also a capable left-arm spinner who plied his trade effectively in the English county cricket as well, where he was signed by Lancashire in 2004 in place of Stuart Law and then in 2005, Leicestershire signed him for a full-time contract. He has also made appearances for the Lashings XI team as well.AdvertisementDinesh Mongia made 8028 runs in 121 FC matches at an average of 48.95 and the best score of 308* with 27 centuries and 28 half-centuries. He amassed 5535 runs in 198 List-A games with 10 centuries and 26 fifties. He made his India debut in 2001 in Pune ODI against Australia but came into prominence for his 159* against Zimbabwe in just 147 balls.Kinks in his technique were exposed on tours to New Zealand and England and after a below-par performance in the 2003 World Cup, he was dropped from the team in 2005, with his last match coming against Bangladesh in 2007. He also appeared in India�s first-ever T20I match against South Africa in 2006. He played 57 ODIs making 1230 runs with one century and in the sole T20I, he made 38 runs.However, his connection with the much-maligned Indian Cricket League (ICL), left him without much support once BCCI managed to force the unsanctioned league to draw its curtains down. �Those were hard days,� recalled Mongia, who was quoted as saying by The Hindu. Most players banned by the Board for their association with the ICL were granted amnesty but Mongia remained the lone cricketer who was kept out of the official circuit.However, he was made a State selector by the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) last season, which he sees as amnesty from BCCI and is looking forward to taking up coaching assignments.",https://www.crictracker.com/former-india-all-rounder-dinesh-mongia-announces-retirement-from-all-forms-of-cricket/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Further, on being asked if he would like to become Team India head coach, Ganguly said, ""Let one coach finish, then we will think about the other coach.""",CricTracker,"India is currently hosting three-match T20I series and three-Test series against South Africa but much of the discussion in Indian cricket is around MS Dhoni and his future in international cricket. It�s been long that the former Indian captain was seen in the Indian team jersey. There were speculations over his retirement, which have not died yet.The 38-year-old veteran stumper has not featured in Indian team since the World Cup 2019 semi-final exit. It was expected as his last assignment, before putting his guards down. However, the glove-man left everyone surprised by not only deciding against retiring but also taking a two-month break. After West Indies Tour, it looked that he might make a comeback against South Africa but he made himself unavailable for this series as well.AdvertisementRecently, a throwback tweet by Virat Kohli sparked the rumours of Dhoni announcing his retirement, which became the top trend on social media at that time, which was later explained by the Indian skipper in the press conference ahead of the first T20I against South Africa in Dharamshala.Former Indian skipper, Sourav Ganguly, at a promotional event, was asked about the retirement of Dhoni, �I don�t know what the selectors think, what Virat Kohli thinks. They are the important persons, let them make the decision,� said Ganguly as quoted by Times Now.Ganguly also praised the current Indian skipper over his performances and regarded him as the best batsman in the world but Steve Smith record also speaks for itself, �These are questions not to be answered. How does it matter? It�s about performance. Virat is the best in the world at the moment. So that�s what makes us happy.

1032,Amazon changed product search to favour more profitable products: WSJ,"Amazon tweaked its product-search algorithm to favour more profitable products, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday quoting Amazon employees. It said the move may have favoured Amazon's own brands to appear in the product search, adding that the algorithm was modified late last year. However, Amazon denied any such change to the algorithm to favour profitability or own products.",Engadget,"Amazon reportedly tweaked its product-search algorithm to favor products that are more profitable to the company. People who worked on the algorithm say the change could give Amazon's own brands a boost, The Wall Street Journal reports. If Amazon is intentionally using search to promote its own goods, it will likely draw more criticism from antitrust regulators.WSJ sources said the algorithm was modified late last year, and that the unpublicized change was contested internally. The move supposedly pitted Amazon's Seattle-based retail business and its Palo Alto, California-based search team (referred to as A9) against each other. Several A9 employees say the retail team pressured them to surface Amazon products higher in the search results. To make things more complicated, the two teams used to report to separate CEOs, but both now report to retail chief Doug Herrington.Amazon denies that it changed its search to factor in profitability or that it changed the way it ranked search results to favor its products. ""As any store would do, we consider the profitability of the products we list and feature on the site, but it is just one metric and not in any way a key driver of what we show customers,"" a company spokeswoman said in an email to Engadget.But promoting products that are more profitable could push customers towards Amazon's in-house products. Though, the search algorithm still takes other factors into consideration, and in some cases, third-party and brand-name products may still be more profitable for Amazon than its own products.The news will likely raise concern among politicians and regulators. Amazon -- along with Apple, Facebook and Google -- is already being investigated as part of a federal antitrust probe. Apple recently tweaked its App Store search algorithm so that its apps weren't always ranked first, and the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for manipulating search results to promote its own products. Amazon has undoubtedly justified the algorithm change. Whether or not regulators will agree is unclear.Update 9/16/19 4:00PM ET: This story has been updated to include a statement from Amazon.Update 9/16/19 4:10PM ET: The story was updated to clarify Amazon's statement.

The talks were held in the framework of ""comprehensive consultations with all parties in Afghanistan"", Iran said. The US had earlier accused Iran of providing military training, money and weapons to the Taliban.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran held talks with a delegation from Afghanistan�s Taliban, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, a week after peace talks between the United States and the Islamist insurgents collapsed. Iran said in December it had been meeting with Taliban representatives with the knowledge of the Afghan government, after reports of U.S.-Taliban talks about a ceasefire and a possible withdrawal of foreign troops. Last week, the U.S.-Taliban talks collapsed and fighting resurged. The two sides had been seeking to reach an accord on the withdrawal of thousands of American troops from Afghanistan in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.  �In the framework of Iran�s comprehensive consultations with all parties in Afghanistan, a Taliban political delegation visited our country recently to discuss the latest developments in Afghanistan with...Iranian officials,� Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted as saying by state media. Mousavi did not give further details. The U.S.-Taliban negotiations, which did not include the Afghan government, were intended as a prelude to wider peace talks to end more than 40 years of war in Afghanistan. Majority Shi�ite Muslim Iran has long had close ties to Shi�ite groups in neighboring Afghanistan whose militias have fought the Taliban�s Sunni Muslim militants. But last year, Afghan government officials accused Tehran, which the United States says is trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan, of providing the Taliban with money, weapons and explosives. Iran denies that. In October, the United States accused Iran of providing military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban. Tehran denied this. Iran was at odds with the Taliban for most of the time the group ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, and massed troops on the border in 1998 after 11 of its diplomats were killed there. Tehran then armed factions that helped U.S.-led forces overthrow the Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

""This is interference to personal rights and discrimination based on religion,"" former rights commissioner Angkhana Neelapaijit said.",Reuters,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand�s prime minister on Tuesday defended police for requesting information about minority Muslim students from universities around the country, after criticism of the move as discriminatory and illegal. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said the police request, which follows a series of bomb blasts in Bangkok in August that were blamed on Muslim suspects, was needed to build a national security database.  An official letter from police, shared online by former rights commissioner Angkhana Neelapaijit, asked a university to supply information about the numbers, place of origin, sect affiliation and other details about Muslim-organized student groups. The name of the university was blotted out. �This is an interference to personal rights and a discrimination based on religion,� Angkhana said, adding that freedom of religion and the right to privacy were guaranteed by the Thai constitution. About 90% of Thais are Buddhist, though Muslims are a majority in three southern provinces bordering Malaysia. Prayuth said the move was necessary. �The police has already pointed out that this is for the creation of a data base on intelligence,� Prayuth said. �No rights have been breached. We cannot manage anything if we don�t have data.�  Muslim students said the police request was discriminatory. �We want the police to reconsider this, the university should be a space where students can express their views freely and their rights are protected,� Ashraf Awae, president of the Muslim Students Federation of Thailand told Reuters. A police source told Reuters the request for information on Muslims was linked to the attacks on Aug. 2 that wounded four people when six small bombs and six incendiary devices went off in Bangkok, which was hosting a major international meeting. Three persons have been arrested and 11 others wanted by the authorities are still at large.  All of the suspects are Muslim Malays from southern Thailand. �We are worried about those ill-intended people who are infiltrating university students,� a police source who did not wish to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media said. Similar letters have been sent to many Thai education institutions as part of a routine update of an existing intelligence data base, the police said in a statement. Some universities with a large population of Muslim students were disturbed by the letter.

They feed on crabs and sea snails.

The series has an 'apocalyptic' storyline with a 'relationship subplot'. It was filmed in Mexico City in late August and the post-production is reportedly underway.",Reuters,"MEXICO CITY / NEW YORK (Reuters) - Popular dating app Tinder has�wrapped filming on its first television series, as owner Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) seeks to dive deeper into creating original content,�people with direct knowledge of the project told Reuters. Making new shows is part of a larger strategy that will be revealed in the near future, a spokeswoman told Reuters, declining to elaborate on the plans. The source familiar with the production said it is Tinder�s�first foray into creating an online platform for scripted video content. The multi-episode series centres on an �apocalyptic� storyline and includes a relationship sub plot but is not directly connected to Tinder�s core dating app business, the source said. It was filmed in Mexico City in late August. Tinder�s move should not be a big surprise given its ownership. Parent company Match is majority owned by IAC, founded by Hollywood legend and IAC (IAC.O) Chairman Barry Diller. Last October, Tinder launched a lifestyle website called Swipe Life to publish original content including articles and videos about dating and relationships.  Offering original content is an increasingly popular strategy for the mostly U.S.-based technology and retail industries that have already attracted millions of devoted users. Walmart Inc (WMT.N) is working with MGM to boost Walmart�s Vudu video service. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) has also considered video plans to keep customers interested in the brand. The strategy seeks to engage users on a deeper level even when they are not using the service. That could help Match hold on to its rapidly growing customers. Its shares have risen more than 75% this year as it continues to add subscribers.�� Reuters reported in April that Airbnb Inc, the start-up for booking home rentals around the world, has ambitions to develop a slate of original shows to whet customers� appetite for travel. For several years, Airbnb has considered various ideas for creating or licensing mini-series and documentaries about travel, and shows featuring Airbnb homes, guests and hosts, according to the Reuters story.

1079,Iran rules out talks with US as Trump links it to Saudi attack,"Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday ruled out talks with the US after President Donald Trump blamed Tehran for an attack on Saudi oil facilities. ""Iranian officials... will never talk to American officials,"" he said. Talks could only take place if the US returned to nuclear accord with Iran that it abandoned last year, Khamenei added.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States believes the attacks that crippled Saudi Arabian oil facilities last weekend originated in southwestern Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters, an assessment that further increases tension in the Middle East.  Three officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the attacks involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating that they involved a higher degree of complexity and sophistication than initially thought. The officials did not provide evidence or explain what U.S. intelligence they were using for the evaluations. Such intelligence, if shared publicly, could further pressure Washington, Riyadh and others to respond, perhaps militarily. Saudi state television said the Saudi Defense Ministry will hold a media conference on Wednesday that will show evidence of Iran�s involvement in the Aramco attacks, including the use of Iranian weapons. Iran denies involvement in the strikes. Iran�s allies in Yemen�s civil war, the Houthi movement, claimed responsibility, saying they struck the plants with drones including some powered by jet engines.         U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said it looked as if Iran - which has a long history of friction with neighbor Saudi Arabia - was behind the attacks.  But in a sign that U.S. allies remain unconvinced, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said he was unsure if anyone had any evidence to say whether drones �came from one place or another.� French President Emmanuel Macron telephoned Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday to discuss the attacks, Saudi state news agency SPA reported. Macron said France was willing to help international investigators, it added. Saudi Arabia sought to reassure markets after the attack on Saturday halved oil output, saying on Tuesday that full production would be restored by month�s end. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out talks with the United States unless the Trump administration returns to the nuclear accord between Iran and the West that the United States abandoned last year.   �Iranian officials, at any level, will never talk to American officials ... this is part of their policy to put pressure on Iran,� Iranian state TV quoted him as saying.  Trump on Tuesday said he is not looking to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during a U.N. event in New York this month. U.S.-Iran relations deteriorated after Trump quit the nuclear pact and reimposed sanctions over Tehran�s nuclear and ballistic programs, severely hurting the Iranian economy. Trump also wants Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including Yemen�s Houthis.     Iran�s clerical rulers openly support the Houthis, who are fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, but Tehran denies that it actively supports the Yemeni group with military and financial support.  Despite years of air strikes against them, the Houthi militia boasts drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia, the result of an armament campaign pursued and expanded energetically since Yemen�s war began four years ago. Another senior Trump administration official said the Houthi claim to have used 10 drones in the attacks was undercut by the fact that Abqaiq was struck at least 17 times. The second location, he added, was hit at least twice by precision-guided munitions. �The Houthi claim does not stand up to scrutiny,� the U.S. official said on Tuesday, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity. The Houthis had never used the type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, that was employed in the attacks, the official added. Strains between Washington and Tehran have risen more in recent months after attacks on tankers in the Gulf that the United States blames on Tehran, and Iran�s downing of a U.S. military drone that prompted preparations for a retaliatory air strike that Trump says he called off at the last minute. Saudi Arabia has asked international experts to join its investigation, which indicates the attacks did not come from Yemen, the Saudi foreign ministry said.        One of the three U.S. officials expressed confidence that Saudi Arabia�s collection of materials following the attacks would yield �compelling forensic evidence ... that will point to where this attack came from.� A U.S. team is helping Saudi Arabia evaluate evidence from the attacks, which hit crucial facilities of Saudi state-owned oil company Aramco in Abqaiq and Khurais and initially cut Saudi oil production in half. The Saudi energy minister said on Tuesday that the kingdom will achieve 11 million barrels per day (bpd) capacity by the end of September.  Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman also told a news conference that the world�s top oil exporter would keep full oil supplies to customers this month. He said Saudi Arabia would keep its role as the secure supplier of global oil markets, adding that the kingdom needed to take strict measures to prevent further attacks, which exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia�s oil industry and the broader global economy.        Oil prices fell 5% after the news that Saudi production is back and extended their losses on Wednesday, having surged more than 20% at one point on Monday - the biggest intra-day jump since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq�s invasion of Kuwait. A day after warning the United States was �locked and loaded� to respond to the Saudi incident, Trump dialed down his rhetoric, saying on Monday there was �no rush� to retaliate and Washington was coordinating with Gulf Arab and European states. �I�m not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this,� Trump said. U.S. officials say Trump wants to ensure the culprit is positively identified in a way that will pass muster not only with him but with the American people. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was traveling to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. A senior U.S. official called for a U.N. Security Council response to the attacks, although success is unlikely because diplomats say Russia and China - which are council veto powers along with the United States, France and Britain - are likely to shield Iran. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Iran nuclear pact, which European parties are trying to salvage, is one building block �we need to get back to�. Saudi Arabia, which has supported tougher U.S. sanctions on Iran, said an initial investigation showed the strikes were carried out with Iranian weapons.     Galip Dalay,�a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Doha Center think tank, said the sophistication of the attacks and the fact such an operation would require high-level approval pointed at Tehran. �Iran is essentially saying, �If I can�t get my oil into international markets, then no one should be able to do it�,� he said. �They are basically looking to destabilize an international market that they have been cut out of by U.S. sanctions.� Reporting by Parisa Hafezi and Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Reuters teams in London, Dubai, Washington, Riyadh, Cairo, Berlin, Paris, Singapore and New Delhi; Writing by Alistair Bell, Lincoln Feast and Stephen Coates; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Howard Goller",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco/iran-rules-out-talks-as-trump-links-tehran-to-saudi-oil-attack-idUSKBN1W2184?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1084,Ben Stokes criticises newspaper over article on murders in his family,"England all-rounder Ben Stokes has described a front page story by 'The Sun' newspaper about a family tragedy 31 years ago as ""disgusting"" and ""immoral"". 'The Sun' published the story about murders of his half-brother and half-sister, titled 'Hero Ben's brother and sister were shot dead'. ""The decision to publish these details has...lifelong consequences for my mum,"" Stokes wrote.",CricTracker,"Ben Stokes had an amazing past two months as a cricketer as he helped England lift their maiden ODI World Cup trophy and then played an amazing inning in the Leeds Test against Australia, to help his team win the match and keep the Ashes 2019 alive. He was great with both the bat and ball. However, the all-rounder has come down heavily on irresponsible journalism of English daily newspaper The Sun.The Daily published an article which revealed sensitive information about the Kiwi-born cricketer�s family and their past which has a sad incident. The story deals with how Stokes� sister and brother, Tracey, eight, and Andrew, four, were murdered by his mother�s ex before the birth of Ben. The England star and his family have never spoken about the incident publicly ever.AdvertisementBen�s mother Deb was previously married to Richard Dunn and when the two separated, Dunn was furious to know that Deb had gotten along with Rugby coach Gerard Stokes. He had the custody of Tracey and Andrew and shot them both dead before turning the gun on himself in April 1988. The Sun mentioned that the birth of Ben gave his mum �something to live fore�, as per family sources.However, Stokes has slammed the newspaper for invading their privacy by sending a reporter to his parents� house in New Zealand and question them about this upsetting event in their life that they had forgotten about. �Today the Sun has seen fit to publish extremely painful, sensitive and personal details concerning events in the private lives of my family, going back more than 31 years,� Stokes posted on Twitter in a long statement which can be read below.�This is the lowest form of journalism, focussed only on chasing sales with absolutely no regard for the devastation caused to the lives as a consequence. It is totally out of order. The article also contains serious inaccuracies which have compounded the damage caused. We need to take a serious look at how we allow our press to behave. Despite the fact that this has now been made public, I do please ask all concerned to respect my family�s privacy and right to home life,� Stokes wrote on his Twitter handle.�Stokes is currently on a break from cricket after helping England draw the Ashes 2019. He scored 441 runs from the five Tests at an average of 55.12, including two hundreds, and took 8 wickets. He scored a magnificent 135* at Leeds, Headingley to help England chase down 359 runs when they were 280 odd with nine wickets down.",https://www.crictracker.com/ben-stokes-releases-statement-slamming-the-sun-newspaper-for-publishing-sensitive-information-about-his-family/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1085,Computer scientist who defended sex offender Epstein quits MIT,"Computer scientist and open software advocate Richard Stallman, who defended late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has resigned as a visiting scientist at MIT's research institute CSAIL. Stallman had described a victim of Epstein as ""entirely willing"". He had also allegedly called for legalising child pornography and abolishing age of consent laws on his personal blog over 15 years.",TechCrunch,"Computer scientist and open software advocate Richard Stallman said he has resigned from his position as a visiting scientist at MIT�s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) after describing a victim of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein as �entirely willing� in emails sent to a department list. Stallman has also stepped down from his roles as president and board director at the Free Software Foundation, the nonprofit he founded in 1985.Last week, the Daily Beast reported that Stallman had also called for the legalization of child pornography and abolishment of age of consent laws on his personal blog in multiple posts published over the course of 15 years.In his MIT CSAIL resignation, also posted to his personal blog, Stallman wrote: �To the MIT Community, I am resigning effective immediately from my position in CSAIL at MIT. I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings.�MIT has been under scrutiny for its ties to Epstein, whom a New Yorker investigation found had secured $7.5 million in donations for the MIT Media Lab, far more than what was previously disclosed. As a result, its director, Joi Ito, resigned last week and MIT ordered an investigation into the Media Lab�s ties to Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell last month while awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges.As part of its preliminary findings, MIT president Rafael Reif admitted that the law firm conducting the investigation had uncovered a letter he wrote to thank Epstein for a donation in 2012, four years after Epstein had already pleaded guilty to procuring for prostitution a girl under 18. �I apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency,� Reif wrote. �Although I do not recall it, it does bear my signature.�Stallman�s emails were first made public last week by mechanical engineer and MIT alum Selam Jie Gano (the entire thread was later published by Vice). In an email sent to a MIT CSAIL mailing list earlier this month, Stallman wrote that Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein�s sex trafficking victims, who testified that she had been ordered to have sex with late MIT professor Marvin Minsky during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands when she was 17, had likely �presented herself to him as entirely willing.� He also wrote that �I�ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is absolutely wrong to use the term �sexual assault� in an accusation.�Gano also published an email that Stallman sent to another CSAIL list that included undergraduate students. In it, he said �I think it is morally absurd to define �rape� in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.�In response to a request for comment, an MIT CSAIL spokesperson forwarded TechCrunch a copy of the email CSAIL director Daniela Rus sent to the department informing them of Stallman�s resignation:Dear CSAIL colleagues,I am writing to let you know that today Richard Stallman submitted his resignation from the lab, effective immediately. In the weeks ahead, we will work with him to come up with a transition plan.We thank him for his technical contributions to the lab, to the free-software movement, and to the wider computer-science community over the decades.Recent events have also prompted me and other senior leadership at the lab to focus on having a discussion on how we can improve the ways we respectfully work with one another in this community. This includes ongoing conversations about the future of the CSAIL-related listserv.My team will continue to keep the community informed of our progress.Daniela Rus",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/computer-scientist-richard-stallman-who-defended-jeffrey-epstein-resigns-from-mit-csail-and-the-free-software-foundation/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The commission had said that tax rulings by Ireland in 1991 and 2007 artificially reduced Apple's tax burden for over two decades, effectively making it illegal state aid.",Reuters,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union�s order to Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14 billion) in back taxes �defies reality and common sense�, the U.S. firm said as the two sides sparred in a case key to the EU�s crackdown on sweetheart deals to multinationals. The iPhone maker is appealing to Europe�s second highest court to overturn the European Commission�s 2016 ruling that it pay the record sum to Ireland. Ireland, whose economy has benefited from investment by multinational companies attracted by low tax rates, is also challenging the Commission�s decision. Apple also accused the Commission of using its powers to combat state aid �to retrofit changes to national law�, in effect trying to change the international tax system and in the process creating legal uncertainty for businesses. The EU executive dismissed the arguments, saying it was not seeking to police international tax laws and accused Ireland of not having done its homework when assessing Apple�s taxes. Apple�s arguments at the General Court, Europe�s second-highest, came after the EU executive in 2016 said the tech giant benefited from illegal state aid due to two Irish tax rulings which artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades. The case could make or break European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager�s campaign which has also led to action against Starbucks, Fiat, Engie, Amazon and others. Apple�s Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri led a six-strong delegation to the court where a panel of five judges will hear arguments over two days. �The Commission contends that essentially all of Apple�s profits from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two branches in Ireland,� Apple�s lawyer Daniel Beard told the court. He said the fact the iPhone, the iPad, the App Store, other Apple products and services and key intellectual property rights were developed in the United States, and not in Ireland, showed the flaws in the Commission�s case. �The branches� activities did not involve creating, developing or managing those rights. Based on the facts of this case, the primary line defies reality and common sense,� Beard said. �The activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be responsible for generating almost all of Apple�s profits outside the Americas.� Beard dismissed criticism of the 0.005% tax rate paid by Apple�s main Irish unit in 2014, which was cited by the Commission in its decision, saying the regulator was just seeking �headlines by quoting tiny numbers�. Paying an average global tax rate of 26%, Apple has said it is the largest taxpayer worldwide and is now paying around 20 billion euros in U.S. taxes on the same profits that the Commission said should have been taxed in Ireland. In its current financial quarter, Apple expects revenue of $61-64 billion and a gross margin of 37.5-38.5%. Commission lawyer Richard Lyal said Apple�s argument that all its intellectual property-related activities take place in the United States was inconsequential. �To a large extent that is perfectly correct and perfectly irrelevant,� he said, adding that Ireland was taxing Apple�s Irish subsidiaries, not the group nor Apple Inc. He said Ireland had failed to examine the functions performed by Apple�s Irish units, the risks assumed and the assets used by the subsidiaries. �They simply accepted an arbitrary method proposed by the Apple Ireland subsidiaries. That in itself gives rise to a presumption of a special deal, exceptionally advantageous treatment. It is clear that the tax authorities made no assessment in 1991.� He said the Commission has no hidden agenda. �What is the case not about? Not about the Commission as policeman of international taxation, not about making sure tax is paid somewhere, though that would be a nice idea, not about resolving tax mismatches,� Lyal said. Ireland said it had been the subject of entirely unjustified criticism and that the Apple tax case was due to a mismatch between the Irish and U.S. tax systems. �The Commission�s decision is fundamentally flawed,� its lawyer Paul Gallagher told the court. Luxembourg, told by the EU to recover millions of euros in back taxes from Amazon, Engie and Fiat, is backing Ireland. Poland and the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) Surveillance Authority support the Commission. The court is expected to rule in the coming months, with the losing party likely to appeal to the EU Court of Justice and a final judgment could take several years. The joint Apple cases are T-778/16 Ireland v Commission and T-892/16 Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe v Commission.

1118,S Asia's tallest tower in shape of 356-m lotus unveiled in Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka on Monday unveiled South Asia's tallest tower, the Lotus Tower, in the capital Colombo. Constructed in the shape of a 356-metre lotus, the tower has been built at a cost of $104.3 million, 80% of which has been funded by the Chinese government. The tower includes a restaurant, conference hall and an observation area, among others.",Reuters,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - The grand opening of Sri Lanka�s tallest tower was mired in controversy on Monday when President Maithripala Sirisena said one of the Chinese firms contracted to work on the project had disappeared with $11 million of state funds. Sirisena made the allegation at the launch ceremony of the China-financed Lotus Tower, a 356.3-metre (1,169 ft) construction in the shape of a lotus bud featuring a revolving restaurant, conference hall and observation area. The Chinese embassy in Colombo did not respond to requests for comment. The tower, overlooking Beira Lake in central Colombo, is expected to become a major tourism attraction. Sirisena said that in 2012, under his predecessor former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the state-run Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) had deposited 2 billion rupees ($11.09 million) with Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co. Ltd (ALIT), a Chinese firm chosen as one of the main contractors. �In 2016, we found ALIT had disappeared. We investigated into this and the Sri Lankan ambassador in Beijing went to the address of ALIT personally on my instruction to find there was no such company,� Sirisena said in a speech. �This is the money we could have spent for development of this country, for education, and medicines of patients.�  Sirisena�s audience at the opening ceremony included Chinese envoy to Colombo Cheng Xueyuan. It was not possible to approach the Cheng at the ceremony for comment and officials at China�s embassy in the Sri Lankan capital did not respond to text and WhatsApp messages. It was not immediately possible to contact ALIT via phone or email. Sirisena had suspended most of the Chinese-backed infrastructure projects started under Rajapaksa when he came to power in 2015 over allegations of corruption, overpricing and flouting government procedures. But more than a year later, the Sirisena government allowed Chinese projects to resume after a few changes in some of them. China�s Exim Bank in 2012 agreed to lend 80% of the total investment of $104.3 million in the Lotus Tower, with the rest to be met by TRC.  TRC in a statement said Chinese firms China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CEIEC) and Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co. Ltd (ALIT) were chosen as the main contractors. Sirisena said the government had started repayment of the loans made, but more funds were needed to complete the project.     Chinese investment has become controversial in Sri Lanka, which is struggling with expensive external debt and where growth is expected to slump to its worst level since a contraction in 2001. Tourism, the country�s third largest foreign currency earner and fastest growing sector, was also hit hard by Islamist militants attack in April. Sirisena�s Lotus Tower allegation also comes ahead of a presidential election later this year.  Political sources close to Sirisena and Rajapaksa have said talks between the president�s center-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Rajapaksa�s Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) for a coalition deal have broken down.

1123,"I don't fear getting typecast, won't stop doing comedy: Varun","On being asked if he fears getting typecast, actor Varun Sharma said that he doesn't fear getting typecast and he won't stop doing comedy roles. ""Comedy is the genre that has given me an acceptance and... identity,"" he added. The actor further said that he likes to make people laugh and it's one of the toughest things to do.",Times Now,"�It was 2013 when actor Varun Sharma tickled the funny bone of the audience for the first time with his role of Choocha in his debut film Fukrey. Since then, he has never looked back and has managed to create a laugh riot in the theatres every time he appears on the screen.


Yet, from Fukrey�onward, in films that followed including Dolly Ki Doli, Dilwale, Fukrey Returns, Arjun Patiala�and his latest release Chhichhore, Varun has mostly donned the avatar of the goofy funnyman in his career spanning over six years. Does he he fear he could be getting typecast?

""In today's time it is a big task to be cast in good projects with good cast on a regular basis -- so typecasting comes much later. I enjoy comedy. I genuinely like to make people laugh. It is one of the toughest things to do,"" Varun said.

""Today, almost everyone is busy. Everyone is so occupied that they hardly get time to laugh their fullest. So, I feel blessed that through the medium of cinema, I can bring a smile on someone's face. Also, Comedy is the genre that has given me an acceptance and an identity. So, I don't fear of getting typecast and I won't stop doing comedy roles just because I have done too many,"" Varun told IANS.

The 29-year-old, however, feels it is important to explore other genres as well.

""I am not a comedian, I am an actor. So it is vital for me to become a versatile artiste who explores all kinds of roles and genres. I love crime, I love sci-fi -- and many other things. I want to showcase different shades to my fans. I really want to do a negative or a dark role,"" he said.

Varun is currently garnering a lot of praise for his role of Sexa, a sex-obsessed engineering student in Nitesh Tiwari's ""Chhichhore"". For him, it would be among his biggest achievements if fans now start calling him ""Sexa"", just as he has been ""Choocha"" to many fans for long.

""Recently I went to a Ganesh Chaturthi event and a fans came up to and addressed me as Sexa. It felt great! You know it's a beautiful feeling when an actor is called by his character's name. It rarerly happens that characters get embedded in the minds and hearts of the audience. Choocha was one such character -- it is a role close to my heart. I made my debut with it and I got so much love for it. I am glad that Sexa is matching that popularity. Within a short time, I have played two beautiful characters that are embedded in people's hearts. Touchwood, from Choocha to Sexa, it has been a great journey so far, and I hope for the best because there's still a long way to go,"" Varun added.",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/varun-sharma-reveals-that-he-genuinely-likes-to-make-people-laugh-calls-it-toughest-thing-to-do/489917?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In the press release, Maitre said that HTC ""will set out immediately to continue the transition from building the worlds' best consumer hardware to also building complete services around them to make them easy to manage and deploy.""That likely means that HTC will continue to develop business services around the Vive VR headset, much like Microsoft did with Hololens.

Ghani was present at the time of the explosion but is safe and unharmed, his campaign spokesman Hamed Aziz said. Presidential elections in Afghanistan are scheduled to be held on September 28.",The Quint,"Separate attacks by suicide bombers � one targeting Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani's election rally and a second that ripped through the center of the Afghan capital � killed at least 48 people and wounded scores more on Tuesday, 17 September, in the deadliest single day since a peace agreement with Taliban insurgents was declared dead.In that explosion, 26 people were killed, according to Nasrat Rahimi, spokesperson for the Interior Ministry. Four among the dead were Afghan military personnel, he said. Another 42 people were wounded, many of them women and children.Also Read : Taliban Visits Moscow Days After Trump Kills Camp David TalksIn the second bombing, just hours later in the heart of Kabul not far from the US Embassy, the Taliban said they were targeting an Afghan army base. They killed 22 people, government officials said. Scores more were wounded.The violence comes as Afghanistan faces presidential elections on 28 September � a vote the Taliban vehemently oppose. The insurgent group has warned Afghans not to vote in the election and said their fighters would target election campaigns as well as polling stations.The bomber, who attacked Ghani's rally, detonated his explosives at the entrance to the rally, according to Hamed Aziz, a spokesperson from Ghani's campaign office. But Aziz said the explosion occurred some distance from where Ghani was addressing a crowd of about 2,200.Ghani condemned both attacks.There were many women and children among the casualties in the bombing near Ghani's rally, said Qasim Sangin, a local official.Local television footage of the attack showed twisted wreckage and charred remains of military and police vehicles that were apparently positioned near where the powerful blast occurred.Firdaus Faramarz, spokesperson for the Kabul police chief, said the attack in the heart of the Afghan capital took place near Massood Square, a deeply congested intersection in the centre of Kabul. NATO and US compounds are located nearby as are several Afghan government ministries.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, released a statement to the media saying Taliban suicide bombers were behind both attacks.In Parwan, Mujahid said the bomber targeted presidential guards who were protecting Ghani and the rally, along with other members of the security forces. Four military personnel were among the dead.Campaigning for the Afghan elections resumed last week after US President Donald Trump declared that the US-Taliban talks, which have been going on for months in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, are over.Most presidential candidates had suspended their campaigns while negotiations were taking place and as the US peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said a deal was all but signed.Ghani, who had been sidelined during much of the talks between Khalilzad and the Taliban, resumed campaigning immediately and had been steadfast in his demand that presidential polls should take place.Khalilzad and some of Ghani's rivals, however, had talked of establishing an interim administration to run the country while a peace deal was implemented.In the aftermath of the scrapped talks, Afghans braced for what many expected to be an increase in violence. The Taliban have refused to discuss a ceasefire and have stepped up attacks across the country.Meanwhile, Afghan forces backed by their US allies have intensified raids on militant hideouts in recent weeks.The Taliban have also refused to meet with representatives of Ghani's government for talks but it was two attacks in Kabul in recent weeks that caused Trump to halt the negotiations with the Taliban, including one that killed two NATO soldiers, one of whom was an American. Another US soldier died in combat in Afghanistan on Monday.Monday's death was the 17th US combat death in Afghanistan this year, according to the Pentagon's count. There also have been three non-combat deaths this year. More than 2,400 Americans have died in the nearly 18-year war.On Tuesday, the Afghan Taliban were in Iran visiting officials in Tehran, while last week they were in the Russian capital holding consultations with Zamir Kabulov, President Vladimir Putin's envoy for Afghanistan.Iran's semi-official Borna news agency on Tuesday quoted the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry there, Abbas Mousavi, as saying the Afghan delegation discussed ""the latest"" developments with Iranian officials.(Published in an arrangement with AP)(Hi there!

1142,"WeWork may halt IPO over investors' valuation, governance concerns","Co-working space giant WeWork is expected to halt its Initial Public Offering (IPO), The Wall Street Journal reported. Investors reportedly raised questions on how much the company is worth and raised concerns about its corporate governance. Past reports had claimed that WeWork, last valued at about $47 billion in January, could seek a valuation as low as $15-18 billion.",TechCrunch,"The We Company, beleaguered parent of the short-term real estate property management and development company WeWork and other We-related subsidiaries, has issued a statement that says it �expects� to complete its initial public offering by the end of the year. The note all but confirms that the company is indeed delaying its IPO roadshow, which had been expected to commence this week.�The We Company  is looking forward to our upcoming IPO, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year,� the statement notes. �We want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment.�We�s plans for a $20 billion public offering have been hampered by questions about its corporate governance and the ultimate value of a company that private investors, through multiple rounds of funding, once thought was worth nearly $50 billion.But under the scrutinizing spotlight of the IPO process, investors have been publicly and privately balking at that sky-high valuation and the company�s questionable governance practices under chief executive officer and co-founder, Adam Neumann, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news that The We Company would put its offering on hold.�Over the past few weeks, The We Company � which has expanded to include a boutique hotel operation, members-only financial services and a charter yacht service (!) � has made several moves to allay investors� concerns. The company unwound some particularly egregious transactions with Neumann and added new directors. It also moved to limit Neumann�s power at the company.And last week, the company amended its prospectus to include the appointment of an independent lead director. It also slashed the strength of Class B and Class C shares so Neumann would not have 20 times the voting power of other shareholders, and removed Neumann�s wife from succession planning at the company.

1151,Iran seizes vessel in Gulf for allegedly smuggling fuel to UAE,"Iran has seized a vessel in the Gulf for allegedly smuggling 2.5 lakh litres of diesel fuel to the UAE, a semi-official Iranian news agency said. The crew have been handed over to authorities in the Hormozgan province. Earlier this month, Iranian coast guards seized a vessel for smuggling fuel in the Gulf and detained its 12 Filipino crew members.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran�s Revolutionary Guards have seized a vessel in the Gulf for allegedly smuggling 250,000 litres of diesel fuel to the United Arab Emirates, Iran�s semi-official Students News agency ISNA reported on Monday. �It was detained near Iran�s Greater Tunb island in the Persian Gulf...the crew have been handed over to legal authorities in the southern Hormozgan province,� ISNA said,     without elaborating on the nationalities of the crewmen. The reported seizure coincided with raised international tensions following a weekend attack on a major oil installation in Saudi Arabia, Tehran�s longtime regional foe. Responsibility for the strike was claimed by Yemen�s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, while the United States has blamed Iran itself for the strike. Iran denies the accusation.  Iran, which has some of the world�s cheapest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and the fall of its national currency, has been fighting rampant fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf Arab states.    AdvertisementIran stepped up its fight against smuggling fuel earlier this month when its coast guards seized a vessel for smuggling fuel in the Gulf and detained its 12 Filipino crew members.  In July, Iran seized a British oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz for alleged marine violations, two weeks after British forces detained an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar accused of taking oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran�s Adrian Darya 1, formerly Grace 1, was released last month. Iran�s Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Monday that the British-flagged Steno Impero oil tanker will be released soon.  The latest reported ship seizure by Iran follows a series of incidents involving shipping in and near the Gulf after U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports took full effect in May. The incidents coincided with stepped up attacks by the Houthis on targets in Saudi Arabia.

1152,Trump says he doesn't want war after attacks on Saudi oil plants,"US President Donald Trump on Monday said it looked like Iran was behind the drone attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia, adding that he didn't want to go to war. This comes as the attacks sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict. Iran has rejected US accusations that it was behind the attacks.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia but stressed he did not want to go to war, as the attacks sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict. Iran has rejected U.S. charges it was behind the strikes on Saturday that damaged the world�s biggest crude-processing plant and triggered the largest jump in crude prices in decades.   Relations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions over Tehran�s nuclear and ballistic programs. Washington also wants to pressure Tehran to end its support of regional proxy forces, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting Iran-backed Houthis for four years. The United States was still investigating if Iran was behind the Saudi strikes, Trump said, but �it�s certainly looking that way at this moment�. Trump, who has spent much of his presidency trying to disentangle the United States from wars he inherited, made clear, however, he was not going to rush into a new conflict on behalf of Saudi Arabia. �I�m somebody that would like not to have war,� Trump said.  Several U.S. Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have blamed Tehran for the strikes. Pompeo and others will travel to Saudi Arabia soon, Trump said. A day after saying the United States was �locked and loaded� to respond to the incident, Trump said on Monday there was �no rush� to do so. �We have a lot of options but I�m not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this,� he said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the strikes were carried out by �Yemeni people� retaliating for attacks by a Saudi-led military coalition in a war with the Houthi movement. �Yemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defense,� Rouhani told reporters during a visit to Ankara. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi called the allegations �unacceptable and entirely baseless.� The attacks cut 5% of world crude oil production. Oil prices surged by as much as 19% after the incidents, the biggest intraday jump since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq�s invasion of Kuwait. Prices retreated from their peak after Trump said he would release U.S. emergency supplies and producers said there were enough stocks globally to make up for the shortfall. Japan said it will consider coordinated release of its oil reserves and other measures if needed to ensure sufficient supplies in the wake of the attacks. Crude prices were down around 1% in Asian trade on Tuesday. �The question is how long it takes for the supply to get back online,� said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. �However, the (geopolitical) risk premium ... which has been basically ignored by markets in favor of growth worries in recent months, is likely to be priced in going forward,� she said. Saudi Arabia said the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons and urged U.N. experts to help investigate the raid. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iranian threats were not only directed against the kingdom but against the Middle East and the world. While the prince did not directly accuse Tehran, a Foreign Ministry statement reported him as calling on the international community to condemn whoever was behind the strike. �The kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks,� the statement added. Saudi Arabia and Iran have been enemies for decades and are fighting a number of proxy wars. Trump said he had not made commitments to protect the Saudis.  �No, I haven�t promised Saudis that. We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out,� he said. �That was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn�t an attack on us. But we would certainly help them.�  Two sources briefed on state oil company Saudi Aramco�s operations told Reuters it might take months for Saudi oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks. Saudi Arabia said it would be able to meet oil customers� demand from its ample storage, although some deliveries had been disrupted. At least 11 supertankers were waiting to load oil cargoes from Saudi ports, ship tracking data showed on Monday. Graphic for attacks on Saudi oil: here Tension in the oil-producing Gulf region has dramatically escalated this year after Trump imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its oil exports altogether. For months, Iranian officials have issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran is blocked from exporting oil, other countries will not be able to do so either. But Iran has denied a role in specific attacks, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and previous strikes claimed by the Houthis. Trump has said the goal from his �maximum pressure� approach is to force Iran to negotiate a tougher agreement and has left open the possibility of talks with Rouhani at an upcoming U.N. meeting. Iran says there can be no talks until Washington lifts sanctions.      U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council on Monday it was �not entirely clear� who was behind the strike but he said it had increased the chances of a regional conflict. But the U.S. ambassador to the world body, Kelly Craft, said  emerging information on the attacks �indicates that responsibility lies with Iran� and there is no evidence it came from Yemen. Iran�s Yemeni allies have promised more strikes to come. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group carried out Saturday�s predawn attack with drones, including some powered by jet engines. �We assure the Saudi regime that our long arm can reach any place we choose and at the time of our choosing,� Sarea tweeted. �We warn companies and foreigners against being near the plants that we struck because they are still in our sights.� U.S. officials say they believe the attacks came from the opposite direction, possibly from Iran itself rather than Yemen, and may have involved cruise missiles. Wherever the attacks were launched, however, they believe Iran is to blame. The attacks have raised questions about how Saudi Arabia, one of the world�s top spenders on weaponry, much of it supplied by U.S. companies, was unable to protect oil plants from attack. Sensing a commercial opening, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to help Saudi Arabia by providing Russian-made air defense systems to protect Saudi infrastructure. Russia and China said it was wrong to jump to conclusions about who was to blame for the attack on Saudi Arabia.

1154,Current account under threat if oil price surge continues: RBI,"India's current account and fiscal deficit could take a hit if oil prices continue to rise after the attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Monday. ""We should allow a few more days...before taking a final view,"" he added. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer, depends on imports for about 85% of its oil needs.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India�s current account and fiscal deficit could take a hit if  oil prices continue to rise after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend, the central bank chief said on Monday.  �We should allow a few more days to see how the situation plays out before taking a final view...depending on how long it persists it will have some impact on the current account deficit and further perhaps on the fiscal deficit if it lasts longer,� Governor Shaktikanta Das told the CNBC-TV18 news channel. Das said it was important to see whether alternative sources of supply come up and how soon the installations take to resume operation. U.S. officials blamed Iran for the attack, which damaged the world�s biggest crude oil processing plant and led to a 19% surge in oil prices. Iran denied blame and said it was ready for �full-fledged war�. A jump in oil prices is a negative for emerging markets such as India, which is the world�s third-biggest importer of oil. The country�s current account deficit in the March quarter narrowed on the back of the merchandise trade deficit contraction but a surge in crude prices could balloon the deficit and wreck havoc with the currency. The partially convertible rupee dropped nearly 1% on Monday to 71.60 per dollar versus its previous close of 70.92. India is also likely to miss its fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, despite receiving an additional dividend from the central bank, five government officials and advisers told Reuters earlier this month, as tax collections have sunk amid a sharp economic slowdown. Das said the monetary policy committee would continue to focus on growth with inflation expected to stay within the medium term target. Asia�s third largest economy expanded just 5.0% year on year in the June quarter, its weakest pace since 2013, far below the median forecast of 5.7%. �The numbers definitely look much worse. The number of 5% is a surprise. We are analysing why exactly it has happened,� Das told CNBC TV18. �Growth now is a matter of highest priority, especially with inflation remaining within 4%,� he added. The retail inflation rate rose to a 10-month high in August but stayed below the central bank�s 4% medium-term target. Analysts believe the slowdown could persist for two or three years while structural reforms are put in place. A Reuters poll conducted after the last monetary policy decision in August predicted the RBI would cut rates by another 25 basis points at its October review and then by 15 basis points early next year.

A past report had claimed that Apple is planning to expand production to Vietnam alongside India.",BGR,"Apple is reportedly investing $1 billion to expand local manufacturing of iPhones in India. The move is seen as the way to look beyond China for assembly of iPhone. It is being described as part of Apple�s plan to export �Made in India� iPhones across the world. The details arrive amidst the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The iPhone maker is expected to become a victim soon forcing it to increase the price of iPhone around the world.Earlier, reports claimed that Apple is looking to expand production to Vietnam and India to thwart effects of trade war. Now, an unofficial source has told the Times of India that the Cupertino, California-based company is investing $1 billion through its partners. �They have said the production will be used for meeting the demand for its products across global markets.� Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn is said to be the investment partner in Apple�s push to assemble iPhone in the country.Foxconn will use its facility in Chennai to manufacture products for Apple�s global markets.

Apple has been assembling iPhone locally in India in partnership with Wistron in Bengaluru. But it is now tapping into Foxconn to further expand local manufacturing in the country. The report notes that �testing is underway� for the products made in India and iPhone maker is seeking clarity on export incentives.After pushing for Make in India, the government is now encouraging companies to make in India and export to the world.

It might be able to price iPhones aggressively to take on Samsung and OnePlus� flagship smartphones. The increased local production is also seen to help Apple meet the 30 percent local sourcing norms required to open retail stores in the country. The Tim Cook-led company is said to be planning to open three brick-and-mortar stores in India and establish online sales. It has reportedly conveyed the plans to the government and is looking at Mumbai and Delhi for first retail stores.95390",https://www.bgr.in/news/apple-to-invest-1-billion-to-expand-iphone-manufacturing-in-india-report/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1169,'Pedo guy' common insult when I was growing up: Elon Musk to court,"Founder of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk argued in court that his tweet calling British diver Vernon Unsworth a 'pedo guy' was meant to be an insult and not an accusation. ""Pedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up,"" Musk argued. Unsworth had helped rescue 12 boys from a Thai cave last year.",Engadget,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't believe his use of the term of ""pedo guy"" was an actual accusation of pedophilia. Lawyers for Musk in a court filing today argued that the missive, which Musk directed at a British diver last year and has made the South African billionaire the target of a defamation lawsuit, is actually a common insult from his childhood.""By referring to Mr. Unsworth as 'pedo guy,' I did not intend to convey any facts or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia,"" Musk said in a court filing Monday. ""Pedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up. It is synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of pedophilia."" Musk followed up his original tweet with another tweet that read, ""bet you a signed dollar it's true.""Shortly after he sent his tweets, Musk paid a private investigator $50,000 to investigate the British diver in question, Vernon Unsworth. The investigator claimed to unearth a series of salacious details about Unsworth's life, including telling Musk that he was a regular at Pattaya Beach -- a region in Thailand known for sex trafficking -- and married his wife when she was a teenager. Unsworth's 40-year old wife has since disputed the claims, saying that the couple has been married for seven years.Musk's lawyers are arguing that that there is no evidence to prove that he genuinely believed Unsworth to be a pedophile. ""There is no evidence that Mr Musk intended or believed that his July 15 tweets, that Mr Unsworth was 'sus' or 'pedo guy', would be interpreted as fact,"" the filing said. ""To the contrary, the evidence is that Mr Musk believed and intended his statements to be read as what they were: bare insults.""The complaint was filed in the US District Court of the Central District of California. The first hearing will be on October 28th and the trial will occur on December 2nd; both in Los Angeles. Musk last year asked the judge to toss out the lawsuit, labeling it a ""schoolyard spat"".",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/16/elon-musk-pedo-guy-tweet/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Agarwal is purchasing a $1.5-billion stake from early OYO investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia India and is receiving a $2-billion loan from three Japanese lenders. He will invest the rest $500 million in the startup.,Entrackr,"OYO�s founder Ritesh Agarwal�ambitious $1.5 billion stock buyback plan has got a green signal from the Competition Commission of India (CCI).The approval will allow OYO�s founder to facilitate a transaction through freshly formed Cayman-based RA Hospitality Holdings, explicitly devised to facilitate this primary and secondary transaction on behalf of Agarwal.The transaction would take the valuation of OYO to $10 billion, whereas Agarwal current 9% stake would increase to over 30%.�The company will get an additional primary infusion of approximately $1.5 billion to support our mission,� an ET�report�quoted Agarwal as saying after getting the approval.He further added that the transaction would help OYO maintaining its leadership position in India and other overseas markets including Southeast Asai, Middle East, US and Europe.The stock buyback plan will also give the biggest cashout to venture funds Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital.Lightspeed, which holds around 13% stake (for $20 million investment) in OYO, is set to make around $1 billion from the sale of its half stake.

1173,Boat was pulled into whirlpool: Survivors recall Godavari boat tragedy,"Recalling the Godavari boat tragedy on Sunday, in which at least 11 people were killed and around 24 are missing, survivor Jyoti Babu said, ""The boat was being pulled into a whirlpool."" A survivor named Madhulata, who lost her 12-year-old daughter while her husband is missing, said, ""I told them not to rescue me. There's no point in staying alive.""",The News Minute,"""I told them not to rescue me. There's no point in staying alive. At 33 years, my life is over,"" Madhulata tells her visitors at the Rajahmundry Government General Hospital, pausing to weep in between sentences. Madhulata had just been taken to the mortuary to see the body of her 12-year-old daughter Hasini, who lost her life in the Godavari boat tragedy on Sunday. Her cries ring across the hospital room, as she weeps for her child.Madhulata's husband, Subramanyam, is one of the 24 people still missing, most of whom are presumed to be dead. A short, fun family holiday to Bhadrachalam has now ended in Madhulata losing her only child, and possibly her husband, to the violent waters of the Godavari.At the hospital are 17 other survivors of the accident, who were brought here from Devipatnam around midnight on Sunday. Earlier in the day, they had all been on a boat called the Royal Vashishta, which had capsized while carrying 61 people, near Kachuluru village of Devipatnam mandal in East Godavari district.Less than 24 hours have passed since the disaster. Most of the survivors are steeped in trauma � of having nearly lost their lives, of identifying the bodies while fearing the worst.�A fun holiday gone horribly wrong�My colleagues and I had been planning the trip for a while. Now I have lost two of my close friends. I don't know when this feeling of depression will stop,"" says Jyoti Babu, a carpenter in his 20s, who had gone on the boat ride with four of his friends who all work in carpentry or construction.The boat was filled with similar groups of friends and family, who were looking to have a good time on the picturesque boat ride in the Godavari through the Papikondalu (Papi hills) to Bhadrachalam.According to the survivors, the boat left from the Gandi Pochamma temple sometime after 11 am. Within a few minutes, they were instructed by the boat crew to put on their life jackets, as they were approaching a police station. ""They didn't tell us how to wear them, how to tighten the belt properly etc. The police then did a check, took photos and let the boat go ahead,"" says Jyoti Babu. Survivors say that most of them soon removed their jackets and placed them under their chairs, unable to bear the humidity, but the crew never took the life jackets seriously. ""Even the few people wearing it had just slipped them on loosely,"" Jyoti Babu says.As passengers moved to the top deck, where a performance area and a sun shelter had been set up, the boat shook once even in the beginning of the journey, Jyoti Babu claims, but the crew kept assuring passengers that the driver would be careful, in spite of overloading. ""The entertainment staff explicitly said that we were approaching waters of dangerous depth, but the driver would be careful,"" he says.The entertainment staff were singing and dancing to film songs in the performance area, with some passengers joining in, says Prabhakar, a 47-year-old railways employee from Kazipet in Warangal, who had been planning the trip with his group of friends for months.""As we neared Kachuluru, they just told us to go back to our seats and not to move, as it was a dangerous area. Our life jackets were still under our chairs,"" Prabhakar says, recalling the exact moment of the accident. ""The boat started to tilt to our side. Since the chairs were not fixed to the deck floor, the chair from the other end started tumbling down. Then the people also began to fall on us,"" he says. He expected this to be a small tremor, like earlier, and waited for the boat to come back to its position. ""Slowly, water started to enter through the railing and I realised this was really happening, the boat was capsizing,"" he recalls.Madhulata also recalls how everything happened so quickly, there was no time to react� ""It took less than a minute for the boat to topple. Within the next two minutes, most of the people had drowned,"" she says.Rescue for a fortunate few As the boat started to drown, many passengers tried to hold on to the railing, as the unused orange life jackets began to float all around them. Some of them, like Prabhakar and Jyoti Babu, tried to throw the life jackets to others around them, so they could hold on to them and try to stay afloat.""The boat was being pulled into a whirlpool. If we stayed there, even the life jacket would have been of no help, so I swam away from the whirlpool, holding onto the jacket,"" Jyoti Babu says.He says they were lucky that the accident happened at a place where they were visible to the fishermen from Tutukunta, who instantly arrived in their fishing boats to rescue people who had tried to swim to safety. ""They did multiple trips to try and rescue as many people as they could, almost everyone who has survived owes their life to the fishing community there,"" says Prabhakar.Prabhakar's friend Suresh, who tried to save another friend Avinash, held onto him until the fishing boat arrived. But only after hauling his friend on to the boat, Suresh realised that his friend had already breathed his last.The fishermen, who knew the river in those parts inside out, told the survivors that the driver must have been really inexperienced to have taken the boat so close to the whirlpool. ""They told us that the location of the countercurrent is commonly known, and boats are usually directed along the edge of the river to avoid going too close to the vortex,� Jyoti Babu says.Prabhakar says the survivors reached Tutukunta around 1.40 pm, which means the accident might have occurred just a few minutes earlier, around 1.15 pm. About a half hour later, an Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) mobile medical boat arrived at Tutukunta, having spotted the trail of floating life jackets. The survivor group was then taken to a medical camp in Rampachodavaram, where they were provided first aid, before being moved to the Rajahmundry GGH.The traumaSixteen men and two women survivors were brought to the Rajahmundry GGH. Most of them do not have any visible injuries, except a couple of people who've had minor fractures. One man, who was travelling with his wife, friend and friend's wife, and is the lone survivor of his group as of now, has been sent to the ICU. But the trauma haunting the survivors almost has a physical form of its own. While some people cope with tears, some are frozen in a state of numbness even as they recount their stories to visiting politicians and reporters.Prabhakar, who was the only survivor in the ward who could speak without visible emotional scars, says that he had gotten used to speaking to the media since yesterday, as that was the only way he could think of communicating to his family that he was safe, having lost his phone in the accident and being unable to recall any phone numbers.There is anger and resentment among the survivors that they're not sure whom to direct to: the allegedly inexperienced boat driver, the government departments who failed to stop the unlicensed boat, or the police for not ensuring implementation of safety measures.The state government has announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh for families of those who've died in the accident. But as of now, there seems to be no cure in sight for the psychological impact that the incident has had on survivors.�",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/boat-was-pulled-whirlpool-godavari-boat-tragedy-survivors-recall-horror-109005?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
