A spokesperson did not comment beyond the advisory.

28,WeWork Co-founder Neumann to step down as CEO amid investors' pressure,"US-based shared workspaces startup WeWork's Co-founder Adam Neumann is stepping down from the CEO role and will become a non-executive Chairman, a WeWork spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. WeWork Vice-Chairman Sebastian Gunningham and CFO Artie Minson will become co-CEOs, it added. WeWork's largest investor SoftBank's CEO Masayoshi Son led the charge to remove Neumann, CNBC reported.",TechCrunch,"WeWork’s co-founder and chief executive officer Adam Neumann  has stepped down as CEO and will serve as non-executive chairman of the board, the company confirmed in a press release Tuesday following a report from The Wall Street Journal. WeWork’s vice chairman Sebastian Gunningham and the company’s president and chief operating officer Artie Minson will serve as co-CEOs.The eclectic executive has faced increasing pressure to relinquish his throne after another report from the WSJ highlighted his drug use and desires to become Israel’s prime minister, among other strange behaviors.“As co-founder of WeWork, I am so proud of this team and the incredible company that we have built over the last decade,” Neumann said in a statement. “Our global platform now spans 111 cities in 29 countries, serving more than 527,000 members each day. While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive. Thank you to my colleagues, our members, our landlord partners, and our investors for continuing to believe in this great business.”Neumann’s wife and WeWork co-founder Rebekah Neumann is said to have stepped down from her role as well. Rebekah has had several titles over the years, including chief impact officer, chief brand officer and most recently, co-founder and CEO of WeGrow, WeWork’s “conscious entrepreneurial school.”SoftBank, the Japanese investor that has funneled billions into the star co-working business, is said to have encouraged — rather, enforced — Neumann’s reported transition out of the CEO role ahead of the company’s anticipated initial public offering. Per the WSJ, moving to the chairman seat would “allow [Neumann] to stay at the company he built into one of the country’s most valuable startups, but inject fresh leadership to pursue an IPO that would bring We the cash it needs to keep up its torrid growth.”WeWork revealed its unusual IPO prospectus last month after raising more than $8 billion in equity and debt funding. The New York-based company had been valued at a whopping $47 billion, thanks largely to SoftBank’s repeated investments despite financials that show losses of nearly $1 billion in the six months ending June 30.Wall Street investors were skeptical of the eye-popping valuation, leading to reports WeWork would seek a valuation of as low as $15 billion instead, a magnificent defeat for one of the most valuable private companies in the world. Ultimately, WeWork delayed its float altogether, claiming it planned to go public “by the end of the year.”In additional efforts to appease Wall Street, WeWork amended its S-1 filing to include the appointment of an independent lead director and its first female board member, Frances Frei. On top of that, the company decreased the strength of Class B and Class C shares so Neumann would not have 20 times the voting power of other shareholders, and removed Neumann’s wife from succession planning at the company.According to the latest news, Neumann’s voting shares will be reduced from 10:1 to 3:1.Meanwhile, WeWork is working with bankers to reduce the cost of its money-losing operation, with a new report from The Information stating the business may cut as many as 5,000 roles, or one-third of its entire workforce.The WeWork IPO saga draws many parallels to Uber’s pre-IPO struggles. Both companies were led, for years, by outspoken executives, Neumann and Travis Kalanick, respectively. Both men were ousted, in essence, by frustrated board members who were concerned at the potential outcome of multi-billion-dollar IPOs.Given WeWork’s struggle to complete a public listing and Uber’s disappointing performance on the public markets, perhaps private market investors will realize Silicon Valley’s pixie dust doesn’t carry the same weight on Wall Street.As Adam Neumann reportedly faces pressure to step down; it’s looking like a fight for life between WeWork and SoftBank",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/report-weworks-adam-neumann-to-step-down-as-ceo/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In the video, Dhoni's friend can be seen getting bowled after which he says he wasn't ready and gets out on the next ball.",CricTracker,"MS Dhoni has been a legendary cricketer for the Indian cricket after he made his debut at the highest level in 2004 versus Bangladesh. Around three years later, he took the mantle of leadership in the 2007 T20 World Cup and guided the team to glory, defying all the odds. Later that year, he was made the ODI captain in the tri-nation series in Australia that the Men in Blue won.It was the same year when India crashed out of the World Cup in the West Indies after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the first round. A year later, the keeper became the Test skipper as well and ever since, Indian cricket has seen an upsurge. 12 years since his foray into international cricket, the Jharkhand-born is one of the greatest cricketers India have ever produced.AdvertisementWhen he came into the scheme of things, India also got an answer to their problem of finding a genuine all-format keeper-batsman. Parking aside his prowess on the field, Dhoni isn’t an active participant on social media platforms, but keeps on chipping in with posts from time to time.Recently, he posted a video where he went down the memory lane to his school days. In the video, his friend got bowled while trying to play a shot. Then the batsman hilariously claimed that it was a trial ball. Dhoni said that the childhood funda was a common phenomenon.He captioned the video and wrote, “Wen U know what’s coming and start the camera and u get it in the nxt 1min, sorry for the bad light but it’s the lingo that’s fun trial ball, umpires decision last decision.brings back memory from school days.he wd have never accepted this ever happened if v didn’t have this video.all of us have witnessed this at some point of time in cricket.enjoy.”Dhoni is going through a rather tough time in his career. He last played the 2019 World Cup in England and Wales. Then he took a break from the sport in order to serve the Indian Army. He missed the series versus the West Indies and South Africa.

36,"FB to not fact-check, block politicians' posts for breaking rules","Facebook has confirmed that it won't fact-check politicians' speeches or block their content if it's newsworthy, even if it violates Facebook's hate-speech or other policies. Facebook's global policy and communication head Nick Clegg said the idea behind the move is for users to ""judge what politicians say themselves"". However, Facebook will delete content that could lead to real-world violence.",TechCrunch,"Facebook  confirms it won’t fact check politicians’ speech or block their content if it’s newsworthy even if it violates the site’s hate-speech rules or other policies. This cementing of its policy comes from Facebook’s head of global policy and communication Nick Clegg, who gave a speech today about Facebook’s plans to prevent interference in the 2020 presidential election.But by seeking neutrality, Facebook may become complicit in the misinformation and malevolence some politicians will use it to spread. It leaves users to fend for themselves as they try to discern fact from fiction and opinion from reality. Clegg claims the idea is for users to “judge what politicians say themselves.”Isn’t that disgorgement of responsibility already what Facebook was doing by merely routing false news links to fact checkers and affixing their verdicts to shares of the content while still leaving it up on the site? To now say politicians can’t be fact-checked directly at all sets a critical and questionable precedent.Facebook’s head of global policy and communications, Nick CleggFacebook’s head of global policy and communications, Nick Clegg“We don’t believe, however, that it’s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician’s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,” writes Clegg, the former deputy Prime Minister of the U.K. “That’s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program . . .This means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review.”Yes, it prevents direct censorship of politicians and leaves critique to the media. Yet it also ignores how Facebook turns any voice into a publication, amplified by engagement-seeking algorithms distributed to billions of people. Users often treat Facebook as the internet and what they see on the internet as true.Facebook doesn’t want false news distorting voters’ decisions ahead of the 2020 elections. However, the year-old “no fact-checks” rule and three-year-old “protected newsworthy speech” rule effectively elevate whatever comes out of a politicians mouth as above consequence.If they share a debunked link, that can be labeled as wrong and demoted, but what they say is free to proliferate and confuse people. Not even a politician’s ads are subject to fact check, so you can spread whatever lies you want on Facebook as long as you’re rich enough and running for office. Facebook only draws the line at allowing content from politicians that would cause real-world harm, or running politicians’ ads that violate its policies.This is certainly easier operationally for Facebook. It doesn’t have to be responsible for paying in-house staff or outside fact checkers to assess politicians’ diatribes. And it won’t as often end up in the cross-hairs of elected officials claiming Facebook is biased against them.Some could see the benefit of these rules being that Facebook could never directly censor a politician unless they directly threatened people. If speaking for themselves from their own accounts, they get what’s close to free speech.But it ignores how politics has evolved in the post-truth era. Rather than win with facts, it’s easier just to shout lies or insults loud and frequently enough that they’re accepted at face value, rebroadcast and culturally ingrained. Sensationalism spreads further than what’s level-headed. The fact check never gets as many shares as the incendiary claim. And those with a bully pulpit can keep an iron grip on their megaphone.Facebook may not want to be the arbiter of truth, or even be considered “media,” but it transmits falsity without question; it’s not a platform, it’s a pawn.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/pawn-not-platform/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

51,"Trump criticises China, says it has broken promises on trade","Addressing the UN General Assembly, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticised China and its trade practices. He accused it of not adopting ""promised reforms"". Trump added, ""China has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft...on a grand scale.""",Reuters,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a stinging rebuke to China’s trade practices on Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not accept a “bad deal” in U.S.-China trade negotiations. Four days after deputy U.S. and Chinese negotiators held inconclusive talks in Washington, Trump’s remarks were anything but conciliatory and emphasized the need to correct structural economic abuses at the heart of the countries’ nearly 15-month trade war. He said Beijing had failed to keep promises it made when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and was engaging in predatory practices that had cost millions of jobs in the United States and other countries. “Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,” Trump said. “As far as America is concerned, those days are over.” Although Trump held out hope that the United States and China could still reach a trade deal, he made clear he wanted a deal that would rebalance the relationship between the two economic superpowers. “The American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance in our relationship with China. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial for both countries,” Trump said. “As I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal.” Trump also recently said he was not interested in a “partial deal” to ease tensions with China, saying that he would hold out for a “complete deal.” U.S. stocks gave up modest gains and fell into negative territory after Trump’s U.N. address, which some investors said marked a reversal of the more constructive tone that had surrounded the negotiations last week. [.N] “Trump’s comments to the U.N. were very antagonistic toward China. In the last couple of weeks there’s been optimism trade would go in a positive direction,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, an investment advisory group based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  “It was the tone and the fact he listed out in great detail all the gripes the U.S. has with China,” Zaccarelli said. “All that trade optimism that’s been building has been sucked out of the air and replaced with pessimism.” Trump’s speech highlighted the plight of U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O), which has become a symbol of U.S. assertions that China fails to protect American intellectual property and steals it or forces the transfer of it. Two years ago Micron accused a Chinese state firm of stealing its chip designs. “Soon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China,” Trump said, “But we are seeking justice.” He added that the United States lost 60,000 factories and 4.2 million manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. “The rhetoric around China and President Trump’s speech was as harsh as we have heard,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at brokerage National Securities Corp in New York. China’s top official at the U.N. General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, sat silently during Trump’s remarks, showing no reaction on camera. Wang is due to speak on U.S.-China relations on Tuesday evening at a business event in New York. The tone of Trump’s speech also was at odds with some recent steps by China to meet his request for purchases of more American farm products. On Monday, Chinese importers bought about 10 shiploads of U.S. soybeans - about 600,000 tonnes. China’s customs commission will exclude certain amounts of U.S. soybeans, pork and other products from its retaliatory tariffs, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday. The purchases were made following last week’s trade talks, which both the U.S. and Chinese sides characterized as “productive.” People familiar with the trade talks said no new Chinese proposals were presented, and the countries agreed to continue minister-level talks in early October. In his U.N. speech, Trump also drew a link between resolving the U.S.-China trade dispute and Beijing’s treatment of Hong Kong. Washington was “carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong,” he said.”The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong’s freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life,” Trump said. Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997. “How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader,” Trump added. Trump also touched on trade with Japan in his speech, saying that he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday would “continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal.” It remains unclear whether the two countries will sign the deal at their bilateral meeting or whether Japanese requests for assurances that Trump won’t hit them with autos tariffs will delay the final agreement.

""She thinks this will impact my chances of finding a bride,"" he added. Agarwal dropped out of college at the age of 17 and founded OYO Rooms in 2013.",The Financial Express," From coding software at the age of eight, becoming a part of a global annual forum for improving science in Asia, authoring a book on top 100 Indian engineering colleges, starting a consulting firm for foreign companies entering India, dropping out of college and becoming the first Indian Thiel fellow, to pivoting Oravel Stays to OYO Rooms and making it a $5 billion private enterprise, Ritesh Agarwal has come a long way. What lies ahead for him is to become the world’s largest hotel chain by continuing to stay innovative. “While one is in the process of coming up with a truly innovative solution, it is essential to keep an open mind,” Agarwal said in a tete-a-tete with Sandeep Soni. Below are the edited excerpts – part 2.While India and China remain your biggest markets but how do you see the graph moving ahead particularly with respect to your US foray?You are right. India and China are two of our biggest and home markets. In fact, China is bigger than India for us in terms of room count. We have over 500,000 rooms in China and more than 270,000 rooms in India. In addition to these two markets, the US is our third home market and it is the fastest scale-up for us in any market globally, with over 100 hotels in a short span of time. The US has the potential to be a large market in the future. Indonesia had a stagnant growth but has taken off in a big way. We have over 21,000 keys in Indonesia. I think as we go forward, China, India, the US and Indonesia will continue to be our biggest markets. The focus in Europe continues to be on vacation homes while we are catering to the growing demand for quality, affordable accommodations in the Middle East.Talking of innovation, when you say you will be the world’s largest hotel company, how does the innovation look to you from the top?While one is in the process of coming up with a truly innovative solution, it is essential to keep an open mind. One should accept failure, and be willing to learn, unlearn and relearn again. We have always believed that an overnight success story is backed by at least five years of dedicated hard work and perseverance. At OYO, we have been able to instil innovation throughout the company by inculcating the ability to make sure that the company and mission come first. This is not just true for the management but also for all OYOpreneurs.Also read: Ritesh Agarwal Interview | It is still Day 0 for us but an entrepreneur is wired for risks, says OYO founderAnother way through which we instil innovation is in hiring the right leaders. We have never lost any single senior leader in the history of our company when large Indian startups have faced huge churn due to the innovative philosophy of ‘Distributed Leadership’ to expedite decision making in the company and retaining top talent from the beginning. This diversified group of leaders hold the key to our growth.How have you deployed technology both on the supply and demand side?Technology has always been a key differentiator for OYO. As an intersection of real estate, hospitality and technology, OYO has over 20 technological products that power various business verticals.

59,Delhi to be 1st state to give legal protection to vendors: Kejriwal,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the national capital will soon become the ""first state"" to implement the Street Vending Act, 2014, to provide legal protection to street vendors and hawkers. ""Because vendors don't have legal status, whatever they do is termed illegal. That's why they are harassed by every department...People extort money from them,"" Kejriwal said.",Times Now,"New Delhi: Claiming to be the first city to implement the Street Vendors Act, 2014, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced that the city government will legalise the street vendors and hawkers and will provide them protection in the national capital.""Delhi will become the first state to implement the Act. Under it, 28 town vending committees have been set up and a notification has been issued. The election for the committees too has been done,"" Kejriwal said.The committees, each having 30 members, have 12 vendors or hawkers as their team, while rest of the members are officials, town planners, police and traffic police, and RWAs and market association, and officials from the health department he said.Kejriwal said the MCDs and the civic bodies have been asked to conduct a survey of vendors through their respective town vending committees. After the survey is completed, street vendors will be given certificates and thereafter, licences will be issued.""The licences will have the name of the owner, address and the place of vending, and this will ensure that they are not harassed by anyone,"" Kejriwal said. He said earlier street vendors were harassed and forcibly removed by police and civic bodies. ""Now licences will be provided to the vendors based and it will end their extortion and harassment"". He added that the Street Vending Act will not only benefit hawkers but will also help in decongesting the roads in the city.The Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 was passed in February, 2014 to regulate street vendors in public areas and protect their rights. It was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2012 by then Union Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Kumari Selja.Kejriwal said as part of the procedure, the MCDs will have a survey to identify the vendors and hawkers in the area and ""those who were removed from any part of the city due to any rule will also be given space."" The Chief Minister said the town vending committees will take the decision on the final number of vendors at any location.""The committee will have all the power. It will identify vending and non-vending zones. The members will decide where the hawkers will be allowed. The government will not have any role,"" he said. Kejriwal said the vendors play an important role in society in any city. ""And it will not be wrong to say they are the lifeline of Delhi.""He said developed nations have a legal way of organising these vendors. ""In Delhi, they play an important role in the lifeline and economy. We buy vegetables, milk, fruits and other daily use things. But we don't have any policy to organise them. This results in so many issues.""Speaking about the issues faced by the vendors, he said the police, MCD and other local bodies harass them and extort money from them. ""Different bodies have the anti-encroachment drive and the vendors have to bear the loss as their products were taken into the custody.""""After the law is implemented, they will not be harassed. We are also exploring if we can provide them with any structure as per international standards with garbage bins and solar panels for electricity. This will also uniform the markets and make them beautiful as well. They will also not hamper the traffic if their locations are fixed. ""He said although there is no estimate of the number but close to five lakh vendors are in the city. ""We are expecting the survey to start in next 10-15 days and each committee will have to deal with about three assembly constituencies. We hope that in about one-two months, the survey will be completed. The weekly markets will also be counted in this,"" he said.Kejriwal said the first choice will be that the vendors should be given the same spot where they are working, ""but the final decision will be of the committee"".On being asked if this was being done just months before the Assembly polls to attract the hawkers and vendors, who were a key vote bank of the Aam Aaami Party, he said: ""We started the work on this soon after coming to power (in 2015), but someone filed a case and the court has disapproved it. Now, in a way, we also have the court's approval.""The tenure of the Kejriwal government will end in February 2020. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had directed the civic bodies here to ensure pavements are cleared from all encroachments and Kejriwal said his government is working on solutions to save the livelihood of street vendors.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/delhi-to-implement-street-vendors-act-says-chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal/494487?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

67,"Fundbox raises $176 million from General Catalyst, others",US-based fintech startup Fundbox has raised $176 million equity financing in a Series C funding round from investors including Allianz SE and General Catalyst. Its total funding to date is around $433.5 million. The new round reportedly valued Fundbox at between $500 million and $1 billion. It plans to ultimately transform B2B payments by creating a Visa-like payments network.,TechCrunch,"Credit cards have become all but ubiquitous for consumer transactions, and it isn’t hard to see why. By intermediating payments, networks like Visa allow buyers and sellers to exchange money for goods and services without knowing the financial risk profile of the counter-party. Rather than applying for credit at every merchant you shop at, you apply once at your issuing institution, and then can transact with every merchant on the network. It’s the simple formula: reducing friction means more sales, and therefore more profits.Yet for all the innovation in the consumer side of the economy, there has been an astonishingly limited amount of innovation in the B2B world. Payments between businesses are still conducted through invoices, with net payment terms that can exceed 90 days and with little knowledge of the financial risk of the counter-parties. There is no FICO score for business as there is with consumers, nor is there a system that can intermediate those transactions and reduce their friction.That’s where Fundbox comes in. The SF-headquartered startup wants to ultimately transform B2B payments by creating a Visa-like payments network that allows businesses to transact with each other without having to know counter-party risk while also getting everyone paid faster.It’s a vision that has pulled in the attention of even more venture capital. The company, which was founded in 2013, announced today that it has raised $176 million in a series C equity financing led by a consortium of funders, including Allianz X,  Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, HarbourVest and a litany of others. Existing backers Khosla, General Catalyst, and Spark Capital Growth also participated. With this new round of capital, the company’s total equity funding reaches upwards of $300 million.Embedded finance, or why fintech mega VC rounds have become so commonIn addition to the equity capital, the company also announced that it has raised a $150 million credit facility to underwrite its product.Fundbox  CEO Eyal Shinar said that a priority in this fundraise was to select backers who not only could invest in equity, but also had large balance sheets who could expand the company’s underwriting capability as it scales.Today, Fundbox’s core product is a revolving line of credit for small businesses. Cash flow is a huge concern for many companies, since they often have to wait for a payment from an invoice to arrive before investing in their next projects or hiring more employees. A revolving line of credit allows companies to flexibly draw down and pay back a loan, while only paying fees on what a company uses.To apply for the loan, companies connect Fundbox to their financial data store (for example, QuickBooks), and Fundbox slurps in the data and offers a credit decision in as fast as minutes. Companies can then tap their line of credit almost immediately and use it as working capital. As invoices are paid, companies can then pay off their line of credit and stop paying fees.From that product base, Shinar ultimately sees Fundbox as a GDP-scale startup, given the value it could potentially unlock for companies and the economy at large. “There are more than $3 trillion locked in those invoices,” he explained to me, “$3.4 trillion flows through consumer credit cards, but $23 trillion are in invoices … and even if you focus on [just] small and medium business, it’s $9 trillion.”As the company collects data from all the players in the market, it wants to build upon those data network effects to ultimately operate the payment rails for B2B transactions. So instead of offering a line of credit to the seller, it could facilitate both sides of the transaction and get rid of the root complexity in the first place.It’s a bold vision, and certainly one that has attracted a variety of players. In the startup world, Kabbage (whose co-founder and president Kathryn Petralia I will be interviewing at TechCrunch Disrupt SF next week) has built a business around line of credit lending and has similarly raised large amounts of venture capital.Larger companies like Square,  PayPay, and Intuit (which owns the popular accounting software QuickBooks) have introduced various lending products to B2B customers. And in terms of payments, Stripe through its new credit card and Brex offer the means for companies to empower their employees to make purchases on behalf of the company.Shinar said that a huge priority for Fundbox has been to make underwriting more efficient. He said that a large percentage of the current employee base at the company is data scientists, and the company has built upon the wave of digitalization that has taken place among small and medium businesses. “Every company has at least one set of APIs … and it is accessible, and it is granular,” Shinar said. By just tapping into those existing data feeds, Fundbox is able to avoid the human underwriting common with much of business lending today.One initiative the company has undertaken is a tool dubbed “X-Ray” to better describe how the company’s machine learning models are really underwriting its loan products. Shinar noted that payments is a highly-regulated space, and that the company has to be able to explain its decisions and how they are unbiased to any regulator that might start asking questions.The company today has 240 employees spread across SF, Tel Aviv, and a recently launched office in Dallas. Shinar says that he wants to use the new funds to “go on the offensive” and “double and triple down on what is working.”",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/fundbox-raises-176-million-series-c-to-build-visa-for-b2b-payments/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The power minister, in his letter, sought a separate classification for solar panels.This comes over three months after domestic solar equipment makers requested for a safeguard duty on solar cell imports from countries like Thailand and Vietnam.To protect local producers, the government had imposed a 25 percent tariff on imports of Chinese and Malaysian solar cells and modules for the first year starting July 30, 2018, and 20 percent and 15 percent for the two subsequent six-month periods, respectively. The safeguard duty will expire in July 2020.Still India’s solar equipment imports have not come down despite the safeguard duty. “For the first seven months of 2019, 77 percent of the solar cells and modules imported into India have come from China,” Rohit Gadre, analyst at BloombergNEF, told BloombergQuint in an e-mailed response.Basic Customs Duty Proposed By Power MinisterSingh, however, said there should be no duty on wafers, silver paste, glass, aluminum frames, and other raw materials used for manufacturing of solar cells and panels till Dec. 31, 2023.Singh said solar PV cells and modules under Customs Tariff Head 8541 should be separated into two custom tariff heads—solar PV cells and solar PV panels. “This will help to provide differential import duties and differential duty trajectory for both solar cells and panels.”The proposal, if implemented, will increase total project cost of solar power developers by almost 20 percent which will further increase tariff to Rs 2.9 per unit, Shashi Shekhar, vice chairman at Acme Solar, told BloombergQuint over the phone, adding that distribution companies won’t buy at higher tariffs.“This is not the way to increase domestic manufacturing capacity,” he said. “The way to make domestic manufacturing competitive is increasing domestic production of glass manufacturing, wafers, raw materials used for solar cells and panels. This should be done with technology upgradation.”According to Indian Solar Manufacturers Association, the current installed capacity is 9 gigawatt for solar modules and 3.3 GW for solar cells.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/power-minister-bats-for-basic-customs-duty-on-imported-solar-panels?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

We heard rumblings that Amazon is working on a competitor to Apple's Airpods earlier this year, but this is the first indication that it will also work as a health device.It's unknown when exactly we'll catch a glimpse of these earbuds. Amazon is expected to unveil a host of new devices at its big hardware event on September 25th. As is typical, the company has remained silent on what exactly we can expect from the event. If last year is any guide, there will likely be some surprises in store. CNBC also reported that the company is working on an Echo device with better sound quality for music -- a rumor that we've heard before -- so we may see that item debut at the event as well.Fitness tracking capabilities and a lower price could certainly give the new Alexa earbuds an edge over Apple's Airpods.

Also joining the initiative will be Amazon, Whatsapp and Linkedin.Group members today met with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss how social media giants are complying with the Christchurch Call to Action. The pledge -- written after a mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand that killed 51 people was broadcast on Facebook Live -- called on technology companies to help advert such incidents. Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Google and Microsoft back in May joined the pledge.The independent GIFCT said they would be committed to carrying out the Christchurch Call's nine-point plan, which included better protocols for users to report harmful content, collaborating on technology, instilling checks on livestreaming to avoid spreading extremist material and more. Facebook unveiled a ""one-strike"" policy for its Facebook Live feature shortly after the Christchurch mass shooting but has yet to deploy any additional safeguards.Most recently, the group contributed to a shared database of ""hashes"" or digital fingerprints of known terrorist images and video propaganda. Since terrorists often upload the same piece of content on multiple social media platforms, it's oftentimes useful for platforms to be on the lookout for such material before it spreads. The size of the database has grown in a period of two years to include more than 200,000 individual ""hashes"".The group's new independence comes as governments around the world look for ways to take big tech companies to task for violent content.

AUSTRAC also ordered investigations into Paypal over ongoing concerns that it is being used by child exploitation rings in Asia. It directed the auditor to look at the fund transfers and record-keeping, and report back within 120 days.",Reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s financial intelligence agency on Tuesday ordered an audit of PayPal Holdings Inc’s compliance with local anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, saying it was concerned reporting obligations had not been met. AUSTRAC, which is tasked with ensuring compliance with the  laws, ordered PayPal’s Australian unit to appoint an external auditor to look at the fund transfers at its own cost and report back within 120 days. AUSTRAC said in a statement that International Funds Transfer Instructions reported by the financial sector provided intelligence that enabled the agency and its partners to combat serious crimes, such as child sex exploitation. “Regulated businesses like PayPal Australia, who facilitate payments and transactions for millions of Australian customers every year, play a critical role in helping AUSTRAC and our law enforcement partners stop the movement of money to criminals and terrorists,” AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose said in a statement. PayPal said its Australian unit reported itself to authorities after an internal review found an issue with the way it reported international fund transfers to AUSTRAC. It said suggestions the reason for the audit was the discovery of child sex exploitation connections were not correct. “We are working in full cooperation with AUSTRAC to remediate this reporting system issue and to undertake the audit as outlined by AUSTRAC in the time specified,” PayPal’s senior communications director, Amanda Christine Miller, said in an email.  The audit would have no impact on customers, Miller added. U.S.-based PayPal operates a worldwide online payment service which connects buyers and sellers through a secure online wallet linked to both parties’ bank accounts. A preliminary report from a separate review ordered by AUSTRAC into buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay Touch Group in June, citing suspected non-compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, was due to be handed to AUSTRAC on Tuesday. Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) players let shoppers purchase products without paying upfront, and without the regulatory hurdle of applying for a credit card or loan, raising concerns about shopper identity. AUSTRAC and Afterpay did not immediately respond to questions about that review. Australian regulators are under sustained pressure to act after the Royal Commission inquiry into financial sector misconduct widely condemned their performance in recent years. The Royal Commission found that when misconduct by financial institutions was revealed, it either went unpunished or the regulatory consequences did not reflect the seriousness of what had been done.

100,Trump put hold to Ukraine aid before call with Zelenskyy: Report,"US President Donald Trump reportedly told his acting chief of staff to withhold about $400-million military aid for Ukraine a week before the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump reportedly asked Zelenskyy to probe ex-US Vice President Joe Biden's son. The decision to withhold aid was based on corruption concerns in Ukraine, the report quoting an official said.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday denied trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating his Democratic rival Joe Biden, but wavered about whether he would release a transcript of a phone call that some Democrats say is grounds for his impeachment.  Trump told reporters in New York that he did not pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July phone call to launch a corruption investigation into Biden and his son in return for U.S. military aid.  “No I didn’t,” Trump said. A U.S. whistleblower lodged a complaint about the contents of Trump’s conversation with Zelenskiy, leading to calls from some Democrats that Trump be impeached for trying to enlist a foreign power to smear a domestic opponent.     Biden, a former vice president, whose son Hunter worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine, is the front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 election.     Trump gave a contradictory message about whether he would release a transcript of the call with the Ukrainian leader.      “I may do it because it was a very interesting call,” Trump said. “It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,” he said. But he added: “I don’t think it’s a great precedent to be releasing calls with foreign countries, heads of foreign countries. So I don’t think it’s a great precedent.” Late on Monday, the Washington Post reported that Trump ordered his acting chief of staff to withhold $400 million in military aid for Ukraine a week before the phone call with Zelenskiy, citing three senior administration officials. One official told the Post that the decision to withhold the funds was based on corruption concerns and denied any link between blocking the money and pressing the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives have called a caucus meeting for Tuesday afternoon to discuss the whistleblower complaint, a leadership aide said. Congressional Democrats demanded documents on Monday from the White House about the Trump team’s contacts with Ukraine. Three House committees - Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight - called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to produce documents related to contacts between Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. The Democratic-led committees said in a letter that they “jointly request documents related to reported efforts by President Trump and his associates to improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the president’s bid for reelection.” Seven first-term Democratic lawmakers also inched closer to calling for Trump’s impeachment, writing in a Washington Post op-ed: “If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.” Trump hit out on Monday at Biden, calling him and his son “corrupt.” Neither the president nor aides have provided any details of possible corruption by Biden when he was vice president under Trump’s predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama. There has been no evidence so far that Biden used his position as vice president to help his son, and he said in Iowa on Saturday that he had never spoken to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine.  Ukrainian officials, while acknowledging they had met with Giuliani, have not said that they would open any investigation of Biden or his son.     Ukraine’s former general prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Reuters on Friday that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden’s son in his relationship with the energy firm.     The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported on Friday that Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian leader in the phone call to investigate the involvement of Biden’s son with the company. He also asked Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani, who had been urging Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens. On Sunday, Trump acknowledged that he discussed Biden and his son in the July 25 call.    Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate Intelligence Committee was working to get the intelligence community’s inspector general to speak to the panel to discuss the whistleblower’s allegations. A Senate aide said a briefing with the panel’s chairman and vice chairman was expected this week.     The media reports about the phone call said Trump repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into the gas company in which Biden’s son was involved was fired. Biden has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired but denies it was to help his son. Biden said the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases. A top official in Zelenskiy’s administration told Reuters that Ukraine wanted to stay out of the domestic political battle in Washington and that any attempt by either side to take advantage of Ukraine would damage relations.

It is the latest case of allegedly radicalised foreign domestic helpers arrested in the city-state, and the government said it highlighted the continued appeal of the jihadists' ""violent ideology"".The trio, who worked as maids for between six and 13 years in Singapore, became supporters of IS after viewing online material last year, including videos of bomb attacks and beheadings, the interior ministry said.Anindia Afiyantari (33), Retno Hernayani (36) and 31-year-old Turmini became acquainted around the time they were radicalised and developed a network of foreign contacts online who shared their pro-IS ideology.""The three of them actively galvanised support online for ISIS.

By next year, according to European Union emission targets, CO2 must be cut to 95 gram per km for 95% of cars from the current 120.5 gram average, a figure that has increased of late as consumers spurn fuel-efficient diesels and embrace SUVs. All new cars in the EU must be compliant in 2021.     For Honda, declining demand for diesel vehicles and tougher emissions regulations have clouded its manufacturing prospects in Europe. Honda said in February it would close its only British car plant in 2021 with the loss of up to 3,500 jobs.

106,"Volkswagen CEO, Chairman charged with market manipulation in Germany","German prosecutors on Tuesday brought criminal charges of stock market manipulation against Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, Chairman Hans Dieter Pötsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn in relation to an emissions cheating scandal. They intentionally failed to inform investors in time about financial impact of the scandal, the prosecutors' office said. Diess will continue as CEO despite the charges.",Reuters,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors have accused Volkswagen’s CEO of holding back market-moving information on rigged emissions tests four years ago, raising the prospect of fresh upheaval at the carmaker just as it tries to reinvent itself as a champion of clean driving.  Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig said on Tuesday they would press criminal charges of stock market manipulation against Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, as well as non-executive Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn. The charges show how the German company, which in September 2015 admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests, is struggling to move on from a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion (24 billion pounds) in vehicle refits, fines and provisions.  Court proceedings are under way over that admission. The indictment from the prosecutors in Braunschweig - in Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) home region of Lower Saxony - is part of a separate legal push to try managers over an alleged delay in informing investors of the company’s wrongdoing.  Lawyers for the three accused said they would contest the charges that they knowingly held back vital information. Volkswagen said its full supervisory board would convene on Wednesday to discuss the indictments. In a statement issued after an emergency meeting, the board’s executive committee said it “cannot see that there was any deliberate attempt not to inform the capital market”. If accepted by a Braunschweig state court, the indictment would lead to a trial date being set. The former U.S. regulator who helped bring Volkswagen’s  cheating to light dismissed the company’s arguments. “The excuse that top managers knew nothing is very weak,” Alberto Ayala, who served at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) until 2017, told German news magazine Spiegel. Separately on Tuesday, German prosecutors hit rival carmaker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) with an 870 million euro fine for breaking diesel emissions rules. The Stuttgart-based maker of Mercedes-Benz cars said it would not appeal. Volkswagen this year bucked a trend of falling demand for passenger cars by launching a range of popular sport utility vehicles, and is investing billions to try to become a leader in electric and self-driving technologies. Its shares were down 2% at 153.42 euros in afternoon trade. Diess’s lawyer said the indictment would not hinder him in his role as CEO, adding that as Diess did not join Volkswagen until July 2015 he could not have foreseen the scandal would have such a huge impact on the company.  Volkswagen shares lost up to 37% in value in the days after the scandal broke. Had investors known about the emissions test cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, plaintiffs have argued. Volkswagen and its executives have said the fallout from the scandal was not foreseeable, and that they had expected to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities prior to the disclosure of the test cheating.  Braunschweig prosecutors said the accused should have kept investors informed. “They pursued a strategy to achieve a settlement with the U.S. authorities without disclosing all relevant information,” they said in a statement.  Winterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke, having been CEO for eight years. He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than Volkswagen had officially admitted.  Poetsch became a management board member at Volkswagen in 2003 and was made chairman in 2015.  The 636-page indictment alleges Winterkorn was fully aware of the matter and potential financial damage to Volkswagen as of March 2015. Poetsch was allegedly informed on June 29 and Diess on July 27. Investigations into the alleged perpetrators of the illegal engine control software, also known as defeat devices, have seen the arrest of the then CEO of Volkswagen’s Audi (NSUG.DE) unit, Rupert Stadler.     In July 2019, Stadler - whose contract was later terminated by Volkswagen - and three defendants were charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices.     Investigations into a further 23 suspects continue, the Munich prosecutor said at the time. Braunschweig prosecutors in April charged Winterkorn and four other managers with fraud over their role in the manipulation of emissions testing.

127,"Hyundai, Aptiv to set up $4 billion self-driving car venture","South Korean carmaker Hyundai is setting up a joint venture with Dublin-based global auto parts company Aptiv to develop self-driving vehicle technologies. Hyundai Motor Group affiliates will collectively invest $2 billion in the venture, valuing it at $4 billion. Aptiv, which will own 50% of the joint venture, will contribute its autonomous driving technology, IP and about 700 employees.",Reuters,"SEOUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group will invest $1.6 billion in a joint venture to develop self-driving vehicle technologies with Aptiv (APTV.N), the biggest overseas investment by the South Korean carmaker to catch up to rivals in the autonomous car market.  Global carmakers and their suppliers are forging alliances to develop autonomous car technologies partly due to the need to share the huge financial and technical burdens. Hyundai has lagged global rivals who have invested heavily into developing new technologies for electrified and autonomous vehicles.  Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), Kia Motors (000270.KS) and Hyundai Mobis (012330.KS) will collectively contribute $1.6 billion in cash and $400 million in research and development resources and others, valuing the joint venture $4 billion, Hyundai Group and Aptiv said in a joint statement.      Dublin-headquarterd Aptiv, which will own 50% of the joint venture, will contribute its autonomous driving technology, intellectual property, and about 700 employees focused on the development of scalable autonomous driving solutions.  Aptiv Chief Executive Kevin Clark in a joint interview with Hyundai Executive Vice Chairman and heir apparent Euisun Chung on Monday the joint venture at this point would not get involved in running ride-hailing, data or network services of its own. Instead, the new firm would begin testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and have a production-ready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers, fleet operators and automakers in 2022.  “Uber is developing its own technology, but potentially our technology could be better than theirs and then they could also become our customers,” Chung said through a translator. Hyundai Motor aims to commercialise its own autonomous vehicles in 2024. Clark said the alliance would initially focus on self-driving technology for passenger vehicles. But Chung said the Aptiv partnership ultimately also could help Hyundai speed up automation for commercial vehicles, such as long-haul trucks. The executives said their technology would be tested and developed across Asia, Europe and the United States to offer products tailored to major markets. They said they would discuss additional alliance members going forward. The new joint venture will be based in Boston, with technology centers across the United States and Asia.  U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking before a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said the deal would reinforce the alliance between Washington and Seoul. Aptiv, which manufactures vehicle components and provides technology for self-driving cars, was formerly known as Delphi Automotive, which was split into Aptiv and Delphi Technologies (DLPH.N) in 2017. Deutsche Bank said in a report that Hyundai’s cash injection would enable Aptiv to cut its near-term funding needs. But Deutsche questioned whether the new structure could deter other automakers from sourcing autonomous systems from Aptiv in the future. Aptiv’s major customers include GM, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Fiat, according to its annual report. Hyundai Motor is also one of its customers, a Hyundai spokesman said.      Market research firm Navigant Research put Aptiv at No.4 among automated driving system companies, following Waymo, General Motors (GM.N) and Ford (F.N). Hyundai was not among the top 10 vendors. The latest investment is another sign that Hyundai has abandoned its strategy of developing technology in-house, a strategy which previously raised investor concerns that it may be left behind in the race for future mobility.      Hyundai, which along with affiliate Kia Motors ranks fifth in global sales, has joined rivals in making a series of investments in technology firms, including self-driving car tech startup Aurora, especially after Chung was promoted a year ago. Hyundai Motor said in February that it would invest 14.7 trillion won ($12.3 billion) in future technologies such as self-driving, connectivity and car-sharing areas by 2023.  In March, Hyundai Motor and Kia announced a plan to invest $300 million in Indian ride-hailing platform Ola, following the $275 million that the pair invested in Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab last year.  The Aptiv venture will be headquartered in Boston. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.

144,"Father pushes 12-yr-old daughter into sex trade in Kerala, 3 held","A 12-year-old girl of Class 7 on Saturday revealed to Childline officials in Kerala that her father pushed her into sex trade two years ago. An official said, ""The instances seem to be numerous and the child seemed to have no count over how many times she was abused."" The police has arrested three men including the girl's father.",The News Minute,"When Childline officials at Malappuram district approached a Class 7 student for counselling following a request from her school, they never imagined that it will unravel a heinous crime. At the counselling session on Saturday, the girl recounted stories of sexual abuse, at the hands of different men, and allegedly with the knowledge of her parents.According to sources in Childline, the 12-year-old girl was being sexually abused and even raped by multiple persons in the last two years. ""The instances seem to be numerous and the child seemed to have no count over how many times she was abused,"" a Childline official told TNM. Medical reports have confirmed that the child was indeed raped.The incident came to light when recently, other parents from the same taluk informed the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of the child’s school that they suspected she was being subjected to something inappropriate at home. “The teachers then began to observe the student. She was absent in the school on most days and mostly kept to herself. As the teachers felt that something was bothering the girl, they informed Childline,” said the source.“She told us that her father's friends did things to her. But we realised the gravity of the situation when we understood that the child was actually pushed into sex trade by her parents. From what we came to know, the parents are not in a good financial condition and they made a living with this,” alleged a source in district Childline to TNM.According to officials of Tirurangadi police, of the multiple persons who have allegedly abused her, she could clearly name only two persons. “We have arrested those two along with the father of the child. We are finding it a bit difficult to proceed with the case as the child does not know the names of any other people who have abused her and the father is staunchly denying all allegations,” said the official.The two arrested other than the girl’s father are 38-year-old Shaiju Karappan and 36-year-old Ashraf Muhammad Kutty.The two have been charged with sections 354 (A) (1) (i) (Physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures), 376 (Rape) of Indian Penal Code and sections 4 (Punishment for penetrative sexual assault), section 6 (Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and section 10 (Punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.“The child is not giving statements to the police as she spoke to the officials of Childline. The only thing she told us was that her mother was unaware of this, while her father knew. But the father has denied the allegation,” the police official stated.The child is at present under the care of Child Protection Committee members and is housed in a rescue home in the district.Also read:Meet Sheeja, Kerala woman who became a toddy tapper to support her familyHow a Kerala student won the fight against restrictions on mobile use in hostel",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/confessions-class-7-girl-kerala-reveal-her-father-pushed-her-sex-trade-109398?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
145,Why Thomas Cook bosses got large sums: UK PM on tour firm's collapse,"After the collapse of Thomas Cook left hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson questioned whether bosses at the tour firm should have paid themselves ""large sums"". Johnson also suggested law changes that would force tour operators to properly insure themselves against a business disaster. He also told why ministers refused to bail out Thomas Cook.",Reuters,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson and unions questioned the part played by Thomas Cook’s richly rewarded bosses in the company’s demise on Tuesday, and asked why the state had to foot the bill for bringing tens of thousands of tourists home. Some 16,500 holiday makers were flying back to Britain on the second day of the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, the Civil Aviation Authority said. Running hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year, Thomas Cook had around 600,000 people abroad when it collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning. It will need the help of governments and insurers to bring them back from places as far afield as Cancun, Cuba and Cyprus.  Speaking in New York, Johnson said tour operators should be insured against such debacles. “I have questions for one about whether it’s right that the directors, or whoever, the board, should pay themselves large sums when businesses can go down the tubes like that,” he said.  “You need to have some system by which tour operators properly insure themselves against this kind of eventuality.”  Thomas Cook was brought down by a $2.1 billion debt pile, built up by a series of ill-fated deals, that hobbled its response to nimble online rivals. It had to sell three million holidays a year just to cover interest payments.  With the business draining cash, Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser found its lenders were no longer willing to step in. Fankhauser has earned 8.3 million pounds ($10.3 million), including 4.3 million pounds in 2015. The Unite union said changes were needed to stop UK airlines collapsing at huge cost to the taxpayer, workers and customers. “Ministers must legislate as necessary to allow UK airlines in financial trouble to trade in protective administration,” the union said. “Other countries do it as a matter of course. We should do it in the UK.”  The company’s British fleet was grounded immediately after the group became insolvent to comply with operating license requirements. But its other airline operations in the Nordics and Germany, which are separate legal entities, were still flying on Tuesday. In Spain, the country’s Acting Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto told reporters that the ministry has been in touch with German and Swedish authorities to ensure Thomas Cook subsidiaries continued to operate at least for the winter season. British tourists staying in Sunrise Royal Makadi Hotel near the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in Egypt said they had no information about flights home. Holidaymaker Andrew Vick, aged 55, said: “There are no representatives to talk to here at all, which is understandable because they have lost their jobs, so they are gone. “It is just not knowing what to do next, that is the problem,” he said.  The British government said it was unwilling to “throw good money after bad” to bail out the company. Reports on Monday said the Turkish government and a group of Spanish hoteliers were willing to support a 200 million pound rescue plan underpinned by a British government guarantee. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom, however, said the sum reported would not have kept the operator going for more than a couple of weeks. “There are all sorts of rumors flying, the fact is that 200 million (pounds) was even an underestimate of what Thomas Cook would have needed just for the very short term, for the next week or two,” she told Sky News. “Thomas Cook is sitting on trying to service 1.7 billion pounds of debt, and it would have been a waste of taxpayers’ money to be throwing good money after bad.” Leadsom said she had asked the Insolvency Service to fast track an inquiry into the collapse, “just to make sure whether there has been in fact any wrongdoing, anything that could have been done differently that could have averted this disaster.” Britain’s Financial Reporting Council said it was considering investigating Thomas Cook in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.  Thomas Cook’s demise sparked alarm at hotels where some customers have been asked to pay their bills again by out-of-pocket resort owners. “I think the questions we’ve got to ask ourselves now: how can this thing be stopped from happening in the future?” Johnson said. Emergency flights brought 14,700 people back to the United Kingdom on 64 flights on Monday, and around 135,300 more were expected to be returned over the next 13 days, Britain’s aviation regulator said.

Diagram shows how a normal uterus compares to sufferers of uterus didelphysThe mother carried all the girls in her right womb, while Harvey grew in her left. Mrs Cotter, from Melbourne, Australia, said: 'From quite early, on Ben and I discussed having children and it was clear that he really wanted to be a dad.'I knew I had to be open and honest and tell him that might not be a possibility for me.'Luckily he wasn't bothered. We talked it through and agreed that there was more than one way to have a baby if you wanted it badly enough.'But actually, we have found it easy to fall pregnant – I am not sure why, or if it has anything to do with my two vaginas.' After starting her periods aged 14, Mrs Cotter soon began to suffer with painful cramps and heavy bleeding.An ultrasound two years later revealed she had uterus didelphys, which occurs when the uterus fails to fuse properly during development in the womb.The mother met husband Ben at 17 and the pair married in 2012. Desperate to become parents, the newlyweds started trying for a baby a year after tying the knotTwins Maya and Evie after being born on June 5, 2018, weighing 5lb 13oz and 5lb 4oz respectively.Miracle babies: Mrs Cotter conceived the twins despite being fitted with a contraceptive implant which is said to be 99 per cent effectiveAccording to the World Health Organisation, the condition affects around one in 3,000 women.A few months after her diagnosis, Mrs Cotter had laser surgery to remove the dividing wall between her two vaginas, which enabled her to enjoy a normal love life. A year later, when she was 17, she met her police detective husband and the loved-up couple got married in Melbourne in 2012.Desperate to become parents, the newlyweds started trying for a baby a year after tying the knot.Uterus didelphys, also known as a double uterus, is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus, to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas, though this is not always the case.It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes.As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ — the uterus.Sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ so the woman is born with two wombs.It often only becomes noticeable after puberty and is diagnosed with a physical exam or an ultrasound scan.In terms of physical anatomy, the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit, though they can be as big as a 'normal' womb.It also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb.Some women are also born with two vaginas, although they can have sex and menstruate in the same way as people with just one.'They may know they have two and be able to find them, or they may not realise,' Dr Leila Hanna, a consultant gynaecologist & Obstetrician at BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline.'It can be painful because there are two squashed in the same area, so sometimes we do an operation to join them together, but its not necessary.'They could also have abnormalities of their kidneys and the tube which bring the urine from the bladder.'Women will frequently have a slightly higher risk of late miscarriage, premature delivery and bleeding during pregnancy.Often Caesarean sections are recommended, to reduce the risk of complications.There is no treatment or cure for the condition.But, while fertility itself was not an issue, Mrs Cotter was warned that miscarriages and stillbirths were a possibility given that her wombs were half the average size.The couple, who were braced for a difficult road to parenthood, were shocked when Mrs Cotter became pregnant with Amelie in October 2013 after just a month of trying.Mrs Cotter said: 'We decided to give it a go, and just see what happened. We knew it might be a bumpy road and tried not to get our hopes up too much.'Just a month after we started trying, I bought a stack of pregnancy tests and started taking them weekly.'Then one morning, I had a test to hand, and there on the stick was a very, very, faint blue line.'I couldn't be sure, so I took a test each morning that week, and each day the line got darker and darker until I was sure - we were pregnant.' The pregnancy went smoothly and baby Amelie was delivered by Caesarean section on June 12, 2014, at Melbourne's Mercy Hospital for Women, weighing a healthy 6lbs 13oz.Settling into family life, the couple decided to start trying for baby number two around 18 months later.After just two months Mrs Cotter became pregnant and was surprised to discover at her first scan that her baby was growing in her left womb, not her right, as before.'I carried Amelie in my right, and just assumed the left one was a dud,' she added.Following another problem-free pregnancy, Harvey was delivered by Caesarean at 33 weeks.Arriving at the Mercy Hospital for Women, he weighed 4lbs 12oz, and, after initially struggling to swallow on his own, was allowed home after three weeks.Already busy raising two young children, Mrs Cotter was unsure if she wanted to try again right away.So a year and a half after having Harvey she was fitted with a contraceptive implant on the advice of her consultant.'The Pill was giving me migraines and I couldn't use the coil, so in the end the implant was the only option left,' she said. According to the NHS, the implant is more than 99 per cent effective – but just three weeks after having it fitted, Mrs Cotter became pregnant with twins. 'This feeling came over me, and on some level, I knew I was pregnant,' she said. 'The day my period was due, I dug out a pregnancy test, and within minutes my suspicions were confirmed.' Mrs Cotter, from Melbourne, Australia, caresses her 15-month old twins Maya and Evie Ben brings daughter Amelie and son Harvey to meet their new siblings in hospital in June 2018. Evie (pictured in the incubator) was born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs when a baby is born with their intestines in the chest cavity'Shocked doesn't begin to cover it. During 17 years together, Ben and I had only ever got pregnant when we'd planned it. Now, here we were, having surprise twins.'Concerned about how long Mrs Cotter would be able to carry twins due to her condition, doctors put her on strict bed rest from 19 weeks onward.'My doctor was very honest and said he couldn't know how the pregnancy was going to play out,' she said.By the 37 week mark Maya and Evie were delivered by Caesarean on June 5, 2018, weighing 5lbs 13oz and 5lbs 4oz, respectively.While they initially seemed perfectly healthy, drama struck just hours after their arrival when Evie began struggling with her breathing and was sent to intensive care.An X-ray of her lungs showed she was suffering with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs when a baby is born with their intestines in the chest cavity.At just five days old she had keyhole surgery, which her parents were warned she had just a 50 per cent chance of surviving. But the youngster made a full recovery and was ready to come home after three weeks.Now 15 months old, the twins are happy, healthy and at the centre of the family's 'crazy, hectic and amazing' life.

167,"Apple confirms will make new Mac Pro in US, not China","Apple has confirmed that it will be manufacturing its new Mac Pro in Texas, US. Apple said it was able to continue making the computer in the US due to a federal tariff exclusion it received for several key parts of the device. Past reports claimed that Apple could move the computer's production to China amid the ongoing trade war.",TechCrunch,"After several months of speculation, Apple  today confirmed that it will be manufacturing the latest version of the Mac Pro in the United States. The move is in keeping with earlier versions of the high-end, pro-focused desktop. In June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would move production of the long-awaited desktop to a plant outside of Shanghai.Apple didn’t deny the report at the time, instead stating, “Like all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States.”This week, however, the company reported that manufacturing will be returning to Austin, Texas, using manufacturers from a variety of states, including Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Vermont. Suppliers include Intersil and ON Semiconductor.“The Mac Pro is Apple’s most powerful computer ever and we’re proud to be building it in Austin. We thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,” Tim Cook said in a press release. “We believe deeply in the power of American innovation. That’s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the US, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with US suppliers, and we’re going to continue growing here.”The move is in keeping with Apple’s commitment to invest $350 billion in the States by 2023. The early reports that the company was shifting to Chinese manufacturing was a major sticking point for Trump, who called out Cook and Apple by name in a series of tweets.“Apple will not be given Tariff wavers, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China,” Trump tweeted in July. “Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!”",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/23/apples-new-mac-pro-will-be-made-in-the-u-s-after-all/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I guess [Indian government officials are] taking time to address their concerns. But you can't always think, think and think, but make no decision,"" Huawei India CEO said. Chinese government officials had earlier also threatened reverse sanctions on Indian firms.",Entrackr,"Amidst reports of Indian Telecos testing their 5G equipment, communication hardware manufacturer Huawei seems to be running out of patience with regulatory bodies in India. The company has clearly stated that it won’t be investing more capital in its Indian operations if denied approval for their 5G equipment in India. The Chinese company’s CEO in India, Jay Chen has stated that the company has made several attempts to get a clearance on rolling out 5G infrastructure with government bodies but have not any official response. “You cannot always think, think and think, but make no decision”, said TOI report quoting Chen. Chinese government officials had previously warned about ‘reverse sanctions’ on Indian companies doing business in China if the Indian government blocks Huawei’s 5G rollout in the country. Huawei has been facing several regulatory roadblocks related to issues relating of privacy, and data theft after reports of the company embedding snooping software in the source code of its servers were released. The steering committee overseeing 5G is looking into Chinese participation in the launch of 5G services in India. The committee had given the go-ahead to Indian telecom operators for their respective 5G trail with an exception for Chinese vendors. In a meeting held in June earlier this year committee head, K Vijay Raghavan said that the matter is under deliberation regarding “the pros and cons of working with Chinese vendors”.Talking about further Chinese investments in India, Chen had previously stated that several potential Chinese investors are closely looking into the Huawei’s treatment by the Indian government before giving the go-ahead for Indian operations.  Huawei itself has invested about $3.5 billion in India and operates a manufacturing unit in Chennai for production of 2G, 3G and 4G equipment. While the Chinese company has lauded the government for their recent corporate reforms, including a substantial cut in corporate taxes but is unsure about its expansion plans. The company has claimed that they’re open to expansion into 5G equipment production and export, but that depends if they’re allowed to participate in the domestic operations of 5G network as well. ",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/huawei-investments-india-5g/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

And trade, I think, maybe is one of the most important.  We’re going to increase trade with Pakistan by a tremendous margin.We do a very small amount of trade with them, and they want to do a large, and so do we.  And we should be able to do that, I think, Wilbur, very easily.  So we’re going to double, triple, quadruple the trade.  It will be very easy to do.  They make great product, and so do we.And I was really shocked when I saw the original numbers from last year and the year before, and for many years, that the trade with Pakistan isn’t much greater.  But it could be many times the number.So we’ll be talking about trade and other things.  And it’s an honor to be with you.  Thank you very much.

One without the other doesn’t work, if you’re going to do mediation or if you’re going to do an arbitration.But certainly, I would be willing to help if both wanted.

And if they — when they come — and, at some point, India may come.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan.And if at any time they say, “You know, we have some points that we think we can maybe iron out,” I think I’d be an extremely good arbitrator.  I’ve done it before, believe it or not, and I’ve never failed as an arbitrator.  I’ve been asked to arbitrate disputes — pretty big ones — from friends.  And I’ve done it in a good, successful fashion.If I can be of help — you know that — if I can be of help, let me know.  But you’d have to have the assent also from the other side.Q    Prime Minister Johnson has now called for a new deal, just moments ago — for a new Iran deal.  This is the first time he’s called for that.  I wonder what your reaction to it.  And have you discussed that with him previously?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think that’s why he’s a winner.  That’s why he’s a man that’s going to be successful in the UK.  And I think that’s great.  You’re talking about Boris, right?Q    Yes, talking about Boris, sir.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Boris is a man who — number one, he’s a friend of mine, and, number two, he’s very smart, very tough.  And he does want a new deal because the other deal was ready to expire.  It was at a very short number of years left.  All that money paid and wasted.  You didn’t have the right to inspect the appropriate sites.  You were looking at sites that would never be used to create nuclear.  The sites that they would use, we weren’t allowed to inspect.  What kind of a deal is that?  And ballistic missiles — they’re allowed to test ballistic missiles and other things.But one of the biggest things is the fact that the agreement is going to expire in a very short number of years.  And what kind of a deal is that?  We’re dealing with countries.  You have to go long term.So, I respect Boris a lot, and I am not at all surprised that he was the first one to come out and say that.Q    Mr. President, this is the first time — (inaudible) from (inaudible) Pakistan.  So this is the first time we get honest leadership like you in America.  And in past —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree with that.  This is the first time you’ve had honesty.Q    Sir, in past —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You’ve had a lot of dishonesty, and they’ve treated Pakistan very badly.  The people in my position have treated Pakistan very badly.  I think that — I wouldn’t say Pakistan has treated us too well either, but maybe there was a reason.  And, in fact, I think there was a reason for it.Q    Sir, in past, you have said that you don’t trust Pakistan.  So, when we have honest (inaudible) —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I trust Pakistan.  But people before me didn’t, but they didn’t know what they were doing.  So it’s just one of those little problems in life.You know, I — you know what I do?  I trust this gentleman right here.  And I do trust Pakistan.  I know — I have a lot of Pakistani friends living in New York.  They’re smart.  Great negotiators, by the way, in case you had any questions.  They’re among the toughest negotiators in the world.And, you know what?  It’s all going to work out.  But if I can help, I’d like to help.  But I don’t think you’ve ever had a President that felt the way I do, in a positive way, about Pakistan.  I don’t think you have.  I’ve looked back, and I’ve seen where it was.  And — and — but I also have a very good relationship with India.  I have a good relationship with both.So, if they decide to use that feeling among both, I think we can help out.  But this has been a longstanding — this has been going on for a long time.Q    Mr. President, yesterday you shared the stage with PM Modi.  He alleged that Pakistan is the hub of terrorism.  Do you endorse that or do you disagree with that?  Because you said that Pakistan has made a lot of progress.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I really have been pointing much more to Iran.  I mean, Iran if you look at what, that’s been really the state of terror.  And I’ve been saying it’s the number one state of terror in the world.  And the agreement we had does not cover that.  It was not doing well.  It was doing very poorly.  And now Iran is doing very poorly.  Iran is a different place than when I took over.When I took over the United States — when I became President — Iran was a real threat to the entire Middle East and maybe beyond.  And now they’re having very, very big difficulties, to put it mildly.  So we’ll see.Q    Are you happy with the progress that Pakistan has made countering terrorism, particularly eliminating terrorism (inaudible)?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’ve heard they’ve made great progress.  And under this leader — he’s a great leader — I think he wants to make great progress because there’s no solution the other way.  The other way is only going to lead to death and chaos and poverty.  It’s all it’s going to lead to.  I mean, he understands it.  Your Prime Minister understands it.Q    Are you concerned about the human rights situation in Kashmir?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  About which?Q    Human rights situation — human rights violations.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sure.  I’d like to see everything work out.  I want it to be humane.  I want everybody to be treated well.  You have two big countries, and they’re warring countries and they’ve been fighting.And — I mean, I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday.  I don’t have to say that.  I was there.  I didn’t know I was going to hear that statement, I had said.  But I was sitting there and I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday from India, from the Prime Minister, and I will say it was very well received within the rule — you know, within in the room.  The statement itself.  That was a big room; there were 59,000 people.But it was a very aggressive statement, and I hope that they’re going to be able to come together — India and Pakistan — and do something that’s really smart and good for both.  And I’m sure there could be — there’s always a solution.  And I really believe there’s a solution for that.(Cross-talk.)Easy.  Easy.  You’ve asked one already.  Go ahead.  Quickly.  Make a one-second statement.  Go ahead, make a statement.Q    Now, if you can solve this outstanding issue of Kashmir —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.Q    — very likely and definitely you will be deserving a Nobel Prize on that.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think I’ll get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things.  I think I’m going to get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they gave it out fairly, which they don’t.They gave it out — well, they gave one to Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it.  And you know what?  That was the only thing I agreed with him on.(Cross-talk.)Come on.Q    Other than Pakistan and India, the Kashmiri people are suffering the last 50 days.  They will talk later on, but right now there was human rights violation in Kashmir.  Fifty days lockdown — no Internet, no food, nothing.  So, you know, what do you want do for the Kashmiri people?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Where do you find reporters like this?  (Laughter.)  These guys are fantastic.All right, go ahead.(Cross-talk.)Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  He’s talking.  Let the American talk for a change.Q    Thank you, sir.  Have talks with the Taliban resumed in any way?  And have you looked to Pakistan leaders to help you in any way —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, we’ve hit the Taliban very hard.Q    — with assistance in Afghanistan.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, I have.  And I think that the Pakistan — I think Pakistan will be a great help.  I know the Prime Minister wants to be a help.  But we’ve hit the Taliban harder than we’ve ever hit them — in all of the years.  I guess we’ve been there now 19 years.  How ridiculous is that?  And when they killed 12 people — one of them an American soldier, as you know, and one a United Nations solider — for the sake of going into the meeting with a little strength, they thought.  They went in with weakness.  And I cancelled everything.  We have hit them harder in the last two weeks than we’ve ever hit them before.Q    When do you think talks could resume again, sir?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll see what happens.  But I will say that the Prime Minister has been very helpful and he wants to do something.  He wants to see something happen.  So, that’s fine.Q    My question is on Pakistan.  Mr. Prime Minister, would you like to raise the issue of curfew and lockdown, and the atrocities in Kashmir before the President of America?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  You know, Mr. President, I was going to raise it in private, but it needs to be said that, for 50 days, 8 million people are under siege by 900,000 troops.  And it’s a humanitarian issue.  And so I was going to say that — were you supposed to meet Narendra Modi now, I would’ve asked you to at least lift the siege.  I mean, it’s a huge humanitarian crisis taking place.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, so we’re going to talking about that in a little while.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  We’ll discuss that.Q    Mr. Prime Minister, what are your expectations from American President about the Kashmir issue?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  My expectations: President Trump heads the most powerful country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world has a responsibility.  And, you know, you very kindly want to mediate this and you also said that to do both, first  India and Pakistan has to agree to mediation.But, unfortunately, India is refusing to talk to us.  So, in this situation, I feel that this is the beginning of a crisis.  I honestly feel that this crisis is going to get much bigger — what is happening in Kashmir.  So we would like to talk about that later.But just the fact that the position of the United States — it’s the most powerful country.  It can affect the United Nations Security Council.  It has a voice.  So we look to the U.S. to put out flames in the world.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And I will say this: Look, I have my respect for your Prime Minister, I will say that many countries wanted to meet with me and us — the United States — during this very short three-day period, and we were unable to meet with many of them.  One of the countries I wanted to meet with was Pakistan and your Prime Minister.  And it’s an honor to be here with you.  And I think you should let us start talking now because —PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — but I do appreciate it.  There’s a tremendous spirit from your press.  I don’t see that.  With us, they want to always tear our country down.  And with your press, it’s really — they would like to see something positive for your country.And I will tell you this: You have a great leader.  And he’s a good man.  He’s a nice man.  Happens to be a great athlete — not that that matters, but it’s always nice.Q    You are a great leader, too, sir.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  You take care of yourselves.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks everybody.END1:18 P.M.

Without naming Pakistan, PM Modi had criticised the country, saying that decision to revoke Article 370 has caused trouble to those who cannot handle their country.",The White House,"InterContinental New York Barclay
New York, New York1:05 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to be with my friend, the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  And we have some great discussions going on with Pakistan about a lot of things, including the Taliban and Afghanistan, and many other things.  And trade, I think, maybe is one of the most important.  We’re going to increase trade with Pakistan by a tremendous margin.We do a very small amount of trade with them, and they want to do a large, and so do we.  And we should be able to do that, I think, Wilbur, very easily.  So we’re going to double, triple, quadruple the trade.  It will be very easy to do.  They make great product, and so do we.And I was really shocked when I saw the original numbers from last year and the year before, and for many years, that the trade with Pakistan isn’t much greater.  But it could be many times the number.So we’ll be talking about trade and other things.  And it’s an honor to be with you.  Thank you very much.  Please.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I look forward, Mr. President, to talk to you about, obviously, Afghanistan, which is a big issue for us Pakistanis, because stability in Afghanistan means stability in Pakistan.  We also want to talk about all three neighbors: Afghanistan, India, Kashmir.  And, of course, Iran, it’s just — we will discuss the situation there because all — these all three neighbors of Pakistan.  And I —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He lives in a very friendly neighborhood.  (Laughter.)PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I mean, as if there are not already enough challenges.Q    Mr. President, after your last meeting with the Prime Minister, you offered to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.  And since then, the situation has gotten more complicated, and India continues to deny our access in the region.  So where does the offer stand now on (inaudible)?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It would always stand.  If I can help, I would certainly do that.  And it will be dependent on both of these gentlemen.  One without the other doesn’t work, if you’re going to do mediation or if you’re going to do an arbitration.But certainly, I would be willing to help if both wanted.  If both Pakistan, let’s say, and India wanted me to do that, I am ready, willing, and able.  It’s a complex issue.  It’s been going on for a long time.  But if both wanted it, I would be ready to do it.Q    Mr. President, with all the things — reverting back to my question in the Oval Office on Kashmir —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.Q    — you know, the thing is, you are asking both the parties to accept and one is aggressor, (inaudible) these U.N. resolutions.  And that’s non-compliant, plus — you know, merging Kashmir into its own territory.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  This is the kind of reporter I like.Q    Which is (inaudible) U.N. resolution.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I like this reporter.  (Laughter.)Q    And how can you —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you a member of this team?  Or are you a —Q    I’m a member of — I’m not a member of this team.  I’m an independent journalist.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You know what?  You’re saying — you’re saying what you think.Q    No, let me complete my question, Mr. President.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, but I have to be requesting —Q    How can you make —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.Q    — an aggressor and a (inaudible) meet and —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s okay.  I understand.Q    — in violation of the U.N. resolutions?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very fair question, or statement.  I’ll — let me put that one down as a statement, if you don’t mind.Q    Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But you’re right, you have to have a — they have to have two parties that want to agree.  And if they — when they come — and, at some point, India may come.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan.And if at any time they say, “You know, we have some points that we think we can maybe iron out,” I think I’d be an extremely good arbitrator.

197,Difficult for Muslim parties to question Ayodhya is Ram's birthplace: SC,"While hearing Sunni Waqf Board and other Muslim parties' arguments in Ayodhya land dispute case, Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud said it'll be very difficult for the board and Muslim parties to question Hindu faith that Ayodhya was Lord Ram's birthplace. ""Even a Muslim witness has said that Ayodhya is to Hindus what Mecca is to Muslims,"" he stated.",India.com,"New Delhi: It would be difficult to question the faith of Hindus with regard to Ayodhya as the birthplace of Lord Ram as even some Muslim witnesses have termed it as sacred for the Hindus as Mecca is for them, the Supreme Court said Monday.A 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi was questioning senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the Muslim parties, on whether the divinity and the “exact form” of an idol or a deity were necessary to hold that they have “juristic personality”.“Even Muslim witnesses (during the trial) have said that Ayodhya to Hindus is as sacred as the Mecca is for them. It will be difficult to rebut the belief of the Hindus,” said the bench which also comprised Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer.Dhavan, arguing for Sunni Waqf Board and others including original litigant M Siddiq, said that only belief cannot be the basis to claim title and accord juristic status to the ‘janmsthan’ (birth place).He, however, strongly pitched for granting respect to Lord Ram and the Allah in a diverse country like India on the 29th day of the hearing in the politically sensitive case.“If Lord Ram and Allah are not respected then this great nation will split apart,” said the senior lawyer but strongly objected to the move to make the birthplace as a party to the lawsuit filed on behalf of deity ‘Ram Lalla Viarajman’ for claiming juristic status for the sacred land.At the outset, Dhavan tried to distinguish between the legal status of the deity and the birth place and said that the latter has been made a party with a sole aim to make a Ram temple at the site and to ensure that impediments such as law of limitation, adverse possession and acquisition do not come in the way.“They just say Lord Ram was born here. None of the contours of the area are mentioned anywhere in the plaint. The suit is thus merely a vehicle to destroy and build a temple.“They have argued that all existing structures be demolished at Ram Janmabhoomi and a new Temple be constructed there,” he said.The bench referred to vehement submissions of Dhavan that belief is a very “tenuous” evidence and the Hindus should establish the long worship instead.“Your (Dhavan’s) first claim is that belief is tenuous as an evidence. But your second argument is that belief should be manifested by way of an object. What exactly is the object you are talking about,” the bench asked.“Is it necessary for a deity or an idol to have divinity so as to make it a juristic personality”.The senior lawyer said there should be “some” kind of physical manifestation of a deity or an idol and even if we concede to Hindus’ belief, then where are the “objective” aspects to support it.The bench also asked Dhavan to provide a list of deities or idols which, as per earlier judgements, have been granted status of juristic personalities. He, however, expressed inability to do so saying that he will have to write 18 research papers for doing it.“Assume that it (land) is the juristic personality and then what will be the consequences. Even assume that it does not have the juristic personality, then what will be the consequences,” the bench asked, added whether same logic would apply in the case of public Muslim graveyards.“The dedication and the long use are the two criteria. A public wakf can be created on these two grounds,” Dhavan said.He said that in the present case, the issue was whether the belief can be attached to an area to make a “vague” title claim and can it be said that the mosque was illegal just because it was built on ‘janmbhoomi’.He asked the bench to lift the veil to see whether the birthplace can be treated as juristic person and reiterated his submissions that Hindus never had the access to the inner courtyard and they were praying at ‘Ram Chabutara’ in outer courtyard.He rebutted the submissions that the lawsuit filed by the Sunni Wakf Board on December 18, 1961, was barred by limitation and said that the cause of action, if any, to file the case arose only on the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949 when the idols were allegedly placed below the central dome.Dhavan also opposed the plea of some Hindu parties that they acquired title over the site on account of legal doctrine of “adverse possession” and said it presupposes the fact that the Muslims were the legal owner and Hindus were having “adverse possession” of the place.“There was no idol in the inner area till 1949 and the mosque was never an abandoned mosque at any point of time. It might have, at best, been unused for some time. That is their (the Hindus’) best case,” he said.Dhavan then summarised his rebuttal to the lawsuit filed on behalf of the deity.“The entire argument was based on belief from scattered sources such as Travellers accounts and Gazetteers which have been found to be inconsistent and inconclusive,” he said.The bench will resume hearing on Tuesday.The Allahabad High Court, in its judgment of 2010 on four civil lawsuits, had partitioned the 2.77-acre disputed land equally among Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the Supreme Court against the verdict.",https://www.india.com/news/india/difficult-to-question-hindu-faith-with-regards-to-ayodhya-supreme-court-3781715/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
198,European nations back US in blaming Iran for Saudi drone attack,"Britain, Germany and France backed the US and blamed Iran on Monday for a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities. The European nations also urged Iran to agree to new talks with world powers on its nuclear and missile programmes and regional security issues. Meanwhile, Iran said European partners have failed to fulfil their commitments under the 2015 nuclear pact.",Reuters,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Britain, Germany and France backed the United States and blamed Iran on Monday for an attack on Saudi oil facilities, urging Tehran to agree to new talks with world powers on its nuclear and missile programs and regional security issues. The Europeans issued a joint statement after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron met at the United Nations on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders.  But Iran ruled out the possibility of negotiating a new deal with powers, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Monday, saying European partners have failed to fulfill their commitments under a 2015 nuclear pact. European leaders have struggled to defuse a brewing confrontation between Tehran and Washington since U.S. President Donald Trump quit a deal last year that assures Iran access to world trade in return for curbs on its nuclear program. The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran and sharply tightened them. Iran has responded by gradually breaching nuclear commitments made in the 2015 accord and has set an October deadline to further scale back its nuclear obligations unless the Europeans salvage the pact by shielding Tehran’s economy from U.S. penalties.  “The time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear program as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles program and other means of delivery,” Britain, France and Germany said.   Tension rose on Sept. 14 following an attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities, which Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran. Tehran denies responsibility, and Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition, has said it carried out the attack.  “It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,” Britain, France and Germany said.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked the European nations for their statement blaming Iran, saying, “This will strengthen diplomacy and the cause of peace.” Macron has led a European push over the summer to find a compromise between the United States and Iran and wants to use the U.N. meeting as an opportunity to revive diplomacy, though his efforts have stalled in recent weeks. When asked about Macron’s attempt to mediate, U.S. President Donald Trump said: “We don’t need a mediator. ... They (Iran) know who to call.” The United States will intensify pressure on Iran, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook said in New York on Monday. The United States was seeking to address the issue through diplomacy and a multilateral effort, and there was a role for the United Nations Security Council to play, Hook said without elaborating. In an interview with U.S. network NBC on Monday, Johnson said Trump was “the one guy who can do a better deal. ... I hope there will be a Trump deal.” Trump flirted with meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while both are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, but the chances appear slim.    “We haven’t received any requests this time, yet, for a meeting and we have made it clear a request alone will not do the job,” Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told reporters in New York earlier on Monday. “A negotiation has to be for a reason, for an outcome, not just for a handshake.”  He said there are conditions for a meeting - Iran has demanded the United States lift sanctions - and then there could be a meeting between Iran, the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China - the original parties to the nuclear deal - but there would be no bilateral meeting. Speaking after he arrived in New York on Monday, Rouhani said Iran’s message to the world “is peace, stability and also we want to tell the world that the situation in the Persian Gulf is very sensitive,” the state news agency IRNA reported.  Trump has criticized the nuclear accord, negotiated under then-U.S. President Barack Obama, for “sunset” clauses by which some of its provisions will expire as well as for its failure to address Iran’s missile program and regional activities.  A senior Gulf official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gulf countries, the United States, the Europeans and others needed to engage in “collective diplomacy” to defuse tensions. “The conversation should no longer be about the JCPOA (nuclear deal) but Iran’s missile program and its regional misbehavior, which are as important if not more important - they have the potential to hold the region to ransom,” the official said.

206,40 killed at wedding party due to Afghan army raid next door,"At least 40 civilians attending a wedding party were killed by explosions and gunfire during a raid by US-backed Afghan forces on an adjacent Taliban hideout, Afghan officials said. ""We were going to the bride's house... (when) suddenly the battle began,"" Mohammad Salim, a relative said. He added that Taliban and security forces ended up killing civilians during the raid.",Reuters,"HELMAND, Afghanistan/KABUL (Reuters) - At least 40 civilians attending a wedding party were killed by explosions and gunfire during a raid by U.S.-backed Afghan government forces on a nearby Islamist militant hideout, officials in Helmand province said on Monday. The raid, days after a U.S. drone strike aimed at militants hiding among farmers killed 32 pine nut harvesters, showed how civilians have borne the brunt of a war that has re-intensified since U.S.-Taliban peace talks collapsed two weeks ago.     Afghan officials said a house being used by the Taliban to train suicide bombers was located adjacent to the bride’s home that came under fire during Sunday night’s commando assault in the Musa Qala area of Helmand in Afghanistan’s south.     On Monday, 30-year-old Musa Qala resident Mohammad Salim carried bodies of cousins and relatives to a burial ground from a house decorated for his sister-in-law’s wedding.     Salim and two senior provincial government officials said 40 people, including 12 children, were killed at the wedding venue when Afghan forces swooped on the house used by Taliban and al Qaeda militants to train male and female suicide bombers.      “We were going to the bride’s house for the henna ceremony, some of us were outside the home and some inside, (when) suddenly the battle began...We told the security forces that we were not members of the Taliban,” Salim told Reuters.     “But both sides ended up killing civilians,” he said. Another 13 wedding party participants were injured.  A senior Afghan Defence Ministry official said the raid was against “a foreign terrorist group actively engaged in organizing terrorist attacks”. He said government forces had also destroyed a large warehouse of militants’ equipment. A second ministry official said a foreign militant detonated a suicide vest that killed him and others around him, including a woman, in response to the raid. “We are aware that civilians were injured in the attack,” he said.     Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said they joined with Afghan security forces in the Helmand operation, conducting “precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and U.S. forces.”     Leggett said most of those killed in the operation were struck by the gunfire of militants or from detonations of their explosives caches or suicide vests.     The Helmand governor’s office said four senior Taliban commanders and the Taliban shadow governor of Musa Qala were among those killed. Twenty-two Taliban fighters in all were killed and 14 captured, the defense ministry said. Five Pakistanis and a Bangladeshi national were among those captured. Bombing, air strikes and ground clashes between U.S.-backed government forces and militants have flared anew since the  U.S.-Taliban negotiations fell apart, and ahead of a presidential election next week.     In the drone strike on Sept. 18 in the eastern province of Nangarhar, six local government officials said 32 pine nut harvesters were killed, 40 of whom were injured.     Malik Khyali, 62, a resident of Khogyani district in Nangarhar, said he lost a son in the drone strike and would not forgive those who carried it out as he knew of no militants hiding among laborers in the thickly wooded area.      Khyali said his son Madad Khan was employed as a cook who was serving meals to pine nut harvesters when a drone crashed into their tents. “I saw body parts being collected in several sacks...If you had seen them covered with blood and dirt, you would not be able to eat for days,” he told Reuters. The Taliban have been staging near-daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks in the run-up to the presidential election on Sept. 28 in order to discourage people from voting.     Last week a suicide bombing outside a hospital in Qalat in southern Afghanistan killed 39 people and injured 140. The Taliban said the target was a nearby building housing the regional government’s intelligence department.      Farah Sami, a mother of four whose three-year-old son was critically wounded in that attack, said combatants were engaged in mindless violence to justify their existence. “All sides have been killing civilians. There is no hero or villain in this long war,” she said. The United States in 2001 sent forces to Afghanistan to oust Taliban leaders after they refused to hand over members of the al Qaeda militant group behind the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Since then, U.S. forces have backed Afghan troops in war against the al Qaeda, Taliban and Islamic State groups that recruit Afghans and foreigners who mount attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and foreign forces.     A U.N. report released on June 30 said 717 civilian deaths were attributed to American and Afghan forces during the first six months of the year, compared with 531 blamed on militants.     Last week President Ashraf Ghani promised measures to reduce civilian casualties. On Monday he tweeted a call for “extra caution” in military operations, and ordered investigations.  (This story corrects to attribute deaths to six government officials in paragraph 14).

This year, the company has seen a 4.4x Y-o-Y growth in revenue in June 2019 (versus June 2018), with 1 million rooms under management across hotels and homes; with over 200,000 rooms in India.Do you think, because of the growth so far and vision ahead, your business model is invincible now, much like what companies like Nokia or Kodak or Yahoo perhaps also thought?From my perspective, as an entrepreneur, one is wired to take risks. You, of course, need to be smart and take calculated risks, and then do all you can to make it worth the risk. At OYO, we certainly don’t rest on our laurels. For us, it is still Day 0 and we have a long way to go. There is always room for improvement in experience and it can be achieved if one listens to the customers carefully.We place our bets on technology and innovation. While we are the first hotel chain to develop in-house technology platform and operating systems, including a suite of over 20 apps for managing all aspects of operations, we are always on the look-out for identifying and adapting to the next big thing. Case in point – IoT switches or evaluating greater use of AI as well as VR or AR for audits and hotel transformation.As an individual, what thought process you go through during testing times such as hotel partners agitation, associations questioning the company’s intent, police case etc.?That’s a very interesting question. When you scale up your business there will invariably be small groups of vested interests unwilling to see the new ground reality. If you see the history of entrepreneurship in India and elsewhere globally, there are many examples of entrepreneurs navigating their way through these challenges. We will not bow down to the unreasonable demands of vested interest groups, a majority of which are owners running competing properties, instigating and intimidating independent hotel owners associated with OYO, and creating false public uproar or arguing against transparent pricing and quality standards introduced by OYO that can fundamentally improve customer experience.So how do you look at addressing these problems?At OYO, we often refer to this as an occupational hazard, that one has to work with keeping in mind the larger picture – 18,000+ hotel owners in India alone choosing OYO and growing with OYO. This year alone, we have had over 642 hotel owners, with hotel sales over Rs 1 crore each, a stark increase from their earnings before becoming a part of OYO. So my personal thought process is to treat the issues based on their merit. The OYO Partner Engagement Network (OPEN) is a great example of us spending our energies on identifying ways and initiatives that can add value to an OYO hotel owner’s experience. I don’t let needless speculation deter me or my team from pursuing our mission.Culturally, the business has to be flexible according to every new market it enters. How do you ensure that at OYO?Our teams across the international geographies have observed local nuances with respect to the hotel industry in each of the countries we are present in. These observations help us in highly localizing and personalizing the experience for our guests. For instance, in the Philippines, most hotel rooms also keep a copy of the Bible in the drawer/on the table in the rooms for guests. In Indonesia, most hotel rooms have the Qibla sign also known as Arah Kiblat in the local language Bahasa. As Malaysia hosts a lot of Indian tourists, the hotels provide information on the nearest Indian/South Indian restaurants.Do you think you have got everything right at OYO so far? Did you ever compromise on growth for anything?Nobody or no company in this world can say they have got everything right and it has been a perfect journey. In 2015, there was a time when we had a lot of complaints regarding our customer service. We took the hard decision of stopping growth for four months, no matter what our shareholders said. And I feel it was one of the best things we did. We focused on identifying key problem areas and finding solutions that are scalable.Today, as we scale across 800 cities and 80 countries worldwide, we adopt a problem-solving approach, identify the opportunity in the middle of every potential difficulty and cultivate cross-functional synergies to surmount obstacles.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

217,No need to fear those who impose Hindi: Journalist Ravish Kumar,"Journalist Ravish Kumar on Sunday said that there was no need to fear those who impose Hindi. ""The number of Hindi speakers appearing for UPSC exams have reduced, and in Uttar Pradesh, 10 lakh students failed Hindi,"" said Kumar. ""A taxi driver in Bengaluru knows up to five languages and there is something we can learn from that,"" added Kumar.",The News Minute,"Journalist and Ramon Magsaysay Award winner Ravish Kumar was awarded the inaugural Gauri Lankesh National Award for Journalism at a ceremony in Bengaluru on Sunday. The award was announced on September 5 on the second death anniversary of Gauri Lankesh by the Gauri Memorial Trust.Speaking while receiving the award, Ravish Kumar, the Managing Editor of NDTV India, said that the award was not a cause for celebration. ""I cannot comprehend how the people living in Bengaluru who consider themselves broad-minded can live with the fact that a reporter was shot dead on the streets. The death of a journalist is the death of the democratic system on which you trust and step outside your house thinking there is a system to protect you.""He also chose to focus his speech on the debate surrounding the imposition of Hindi over other languages in the country. ""There is no need to fear those who impose Hindi. It cannot be the language that unites the country. In the Hindi speaking states, there are no good universities or education. The number of Hindi speakers appearing for UPSC exams have reduced and in Uttar Pradesh, 10 lakh students failed Hindi...A taxi driver in Bengaluru knows up to five languages and there is something we can learn from that,"" Ravish said.Ravish also saved a few words for the Indian media, which he said, is killing the spirit of democracy. ""If you love democracy, you will have to fight the media. The media has long fought for democracy but today the situation has changed. Stop subscribing to newspapers, stop watching television channels and protest in the streets. It looks impossible today but tomorrow you will have to do it,"" said the television journalist.He accused the mainstream media of not carrying voices of dissent, stating, “Many people who come to the streets to protest are those who have voted for the current government. The media is not carrying these voices. The people who are at the protest share the photos between themselves and post it on social media in the hope that it goes viral. The media is recording this but it is not publishing these stories. The mainstream media is busy telling the voter why we are better off under the current government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”The award was announced by the Gauri Memorial Trust and presented to Ravish by 102-year-old freedom fighter HS Doreswamy. An English news website in honour of Gauri Lankesh - www.gaurilankeshnews.com  - was also launched which will be managed by the trust. This is in addition to 'Nyaya Patha', the newspaper relaunched in memory of Gauri Lankesh.Gauri Lankesh was murdered on September 5 2017 at her residence in Bengaluru allegedly by people who wanted to eliminate anti-Hindu forces. The murder shook the conscience of people across the country with thousands taking to the streets across the country, a week after the murder.Two years since her murder, 18 people have been named in the chargesheet by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the murder. This includes six people, who are also named as accused in the murder of scholar and rationalist MM Kalburgi, which took place four years ago in Dharwad.

The 15-digit unique code, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), helps the government track lost phones and block stolen ones. A central portal to help users trace their phones was recently piloted.",Entrackr,"The Department of Telecom is making additions to the Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), a centralised database of the IMEI numbers of all mobile devices in the country, which was launched earlier this year. The ministry has asked handset manufacturers to submit the database of the 15 digits long unique identification code termed as International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) within the next two months.  DoT has been in talks with Indian and international mobile handset manufacturers to compile the IMEI codes for all the mobile phones sold in the country for security purposes. IMEI code is used by the authorities to track mobile phones across the various network providers and to block it if needed. The unique number attached to every mobile device is given by global industry body GSMA, and all telecom operators have their respective database of IMEI numbers of the handsets on their networks. Under the current system, if a mobile phone is reported stolen, it can only be blocked by their previous network provider who had the IMEI details of the stolen handset.Recently, the government has launched a central tracking portal Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), which is undergoing a pilot test in Mumbai, helping users to detect their lost or stolen mobile phones by tracking IMEI number across networks. Talking to ET, a senior official informed that the government currently has the data of all the phone imported in India as it is part of the customs process. Since a large number of phones are being manufactured in India, the department has asked all Indian manufacturers to share the data of IMEI numbers embedded in the hardware of the handsets at the time of manufacturing. There have been reports of hackers reprogramming the IMEI numbers in the stolen handsets to prevent tracking by the authorities, and the department is looking to curb that with the centralised list. Although it is still unknown how this move would hamper the privacy of citizen as the move can allow the government to track all the citizens carrying a mobile phone.

233,Trump says he discussed Biden in call with Ukrainian Prez,US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that he discussed ex-Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump reportedly asked Zelenskyy to probe Biden's son Hunter. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani alleged Biden tried to interfere in an investigation into a company whose board Hunter sat on.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he discussed Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son in a call with Ukraine’s president. Trump’s statement to reporters about his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came as the Democratic leader of a key congressional panel said the pursuit of Trump’s impeachment may be the “only remedy” to the situation. Trump’s call with Zelensky has been at the center of an escalating battle in Washington since Friday, when news outlets reported that Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate whether Biden, the Democratic front-runner to take on Trump in next year’s election, misused his position when he was vice president. Trump told reporters at the White House that their phone conversation was mostly congratulatory but also touched on corruption and the Bidens. “The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said. Democrats have said that if Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden, it is tantamount to promoting foreign interference in the 2020 election.  Trump has denied doing anything improper. His allies, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have defended the president’s phone call, which, according to news reports, was the subject of a complaint made by an as-yet-unnamed whistleblower.  If an investigation shows that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden, the U.S. Congress may have no choice but to pursue impeachment, Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on Sunday. Schiff had previously shied away from calling for impeachment, but his comments on CNN’s “State of the Union” showed his stance had shifted. “If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader to do something illicit, to provide dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that conduct represents,” Schiff said. Other legislators have called for the Democratic leadership to pursue impeachment immediately, but Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far resisted calls to formally begin the process. In a letter to colleagues later on Sunday, Pelosi warned the administration against keeping the details of the whistleblower complaint secret. The administration has so far resisted sharing the details of the complaint with lawmakers. “If the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” Pelosi wrote. Senator Mitt Romney, who has clashed with Trump in the past, sounded a rare note of concern among Trump’s fellow Republicans, many of whom have remained silent, defended Trump or escalated their attacks on Biden in the days after the reports about the Trump-Zelensky call. “If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said in a Twitter post. Impeachment proceedings in Congress, which begin in the House, can lead to a president being removed from office, but Democrats would need the support of Republicans, who control the Senate.  Multiple news organizations reported on Friday that Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden’s son was involved was fired. Biden has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired but denies it was to help his son. Biden said the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases. Biden said on Saturday there should be an investigation into Trump’s call, saying it “appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.” He said he never spoke to his son about Ukraine.

234,Legal steps for UK-flagged tanker release completed: Iran,An Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei on Monday said that all legal steps had been completed for the release of the detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero. Rabiei added that he did not know when the vessel would be released. The tanker was seized by Iran while it was sailing in the Strait of Hormuz on July 19.,Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero is “free to leave,” Iran’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Hamid Baeidinejad, said on Twitter on Monday. “The British-flagged tanker ‘Stena Impero’, pursuant to the completion of the judicial and legal process, is now free to leave,” he wrote. The seizure on July 19 of the ship, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, ratcheted up tensions in the region in the wake of attacks on other merchant vessels that Washington blamed on Tehran. Iran denied responsibility for those attacks, which took place along a vital international oil shipping route. An Iranian government spokesman said on Monday that all legal steps had been completed for the release of the detained tanker but that he did not know when the vessel would be released, Iranian media reported. “The legal work and administrative procedures for the release of the English tanker have been completed but I have no information on the time of the release,” said government spokesman Ali Rabiei, according to semi-official news agency ILNA. The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Rabiei as saying: “The legal work for the oil tanker is over ... and the oil tanker can move, and the decisions indicate the end of the detention.” He did not elaborate. Relations between the United States, its allies and Iran have been gradually more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact aimed at reining in Tehran’s nuclear program and imposed sanctions on it aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.

238,ICC officially warns Kohli over inappropriate physical contact with player,"Team India captain Virat Kohli has received an official warning and one demerit point after being found guilty of ""inappropriate physical contact with a player"" during the third T20I against South Africa. Kohli had deliberately bumped his shoulder into fast bowler Beuran Hendricks while taking a run in the fifth over.",CricTracker,"Whether his team wins or loses, India captain Virat Kohli is never short of his aggressive best. The ace batsman had a moment of ‘clash’ with South Africa bowler Beuran Hendricks during the third T20I in Bengaluru on Sunday. Kohli though failed with the bat in this match after winning the toss and electing to bat. India had an ordinary batting performance that saw the Proteas winning by 9 wickets to level the three-match series 1-1. India won the second game in Mohali by seven wickets while the first match in Dharamsala was abandoned because of rain.It all happened when Kohli was batting and Hendricks was the bowler. The South African did not move from the batsman’s running corridor and that saw the Indian captain, who was taking a run, nudge the bowler with his elbow, leaving him stunned.AdvertisementHendricks, however, had a field day with two vital wickets – Rohit Sharma (9) and Krunal Pandya (4) that reduced the hosts into a troubled lot. The left-arm pacer, who was playing in just his 11th T20I, ended up with 2/14 in four overs which was SA’s best bowling performance and was picked as the man of the match.

240,China studying 'gel-like' substance found on far side of Moon,"China is studying a 'gel-like' substance found in a crater on the far side of the moon. China's Chang'e-4 lunar lander's rover, Yutu-2, spotted the matter last month but it had to shut down after that. A theory about the material proposes that it could be melted glass created from meteorites striking the surface of the moon.",Daily Mail,"China is seeking to get to the bottom of a mysterious 'gel-like substance' found in a crater on the far side of the moon. The nation's Chang'e-4 lunar lander's rover, Yutu-2,spotted the bizarre matter last month but it had to shut down and 'nap' almost straight after. The equipment shuts down for 14 days as the lunar night is so cold it would freeze and destroy the rover if it did not shut down and protect itself. After waking up last week, China sent the rover back to the site in a bid to picture, obtain and study the material. Scroll down for video The nation's Chang'e-4 lunar lander's rover, Yutu-2,spotted the bizarre matter last month but it had to shut down and 'nap' almost straight after. It has now returned to the crater, with the green-ish tinge in this iage revealing the location of the substance A recent post on Chinese social media revealed some details about how the Chinese space agency (CNSA) was intending to detect the material. Debate raged between the mission's driver teams and scientists and eventually, Yutu-2 was sent into the small crater to try and find more information. A first pass was unsuccessful, but a second attempt allowed the machine to get close enough to study the substance with the on board spectrometer. It was studied successfully, CNSA revealed, but the exact findings are still a mystery.   A team member looking at the rover's main camera in August spotted the small crater, which appeared to contain material with a colour unlike the surrounding lunar surface, Space.com reported. Having seen the images, lunar scientists decided to postpone plans to send Yutu-2, which translates to jade rabbit, further west.Instead, the machine was ordered to check the strange material. The rover, which is on the moon with the Chang'e-4 lunar probe, carefully approached the crater and then targeted the strangely-coloured material. It was then that the scientists made the strange discovery, although they have so far only said that the substance was 'gel-like' and an 'unusual colour'.One possible theory which was suggested by researchers not involved with the mission is that the substance is melted glass created from meteorites striking the surface of the moon.Pictured, tracks made from Yutu-2, which translates to Jade Rabbit, near the crater where the substance was found on the far side of the moon  The Yutu-2 rover, which landed on the far side of the moon in January of this year, found the substance last month but news of the discovery has just been made publicYutu-2 has a host of instruments and will be powered by solar panels. This includes a spectrometer which was used to analyse the bizarre find  Jade Rabbit 2 weighs 308lbs (139kg) and has six individually powered wheels so it can continue to operate even if one wheel fails. It rolled on to the lunar surface from the lander via two ramps and will explore the Von Karman crater in the southern region of the far side of the moon Chang'e is the moon goddess and wife of god Houyi in Ancient Chinese mythology. Houyi is one of the most powerful mythological figures in China. It is said that he shot down nine Suns to make Earth a liveable habitat for human beings.The number four in the name is a more modern-day nod to the space programme. This spacecraft is the fourth of the Chang'e missions.  Yutu (jade rabbit) is the companion of Chang'e in the mythological stories. This is fittingly also the name of the rover on-board Chang'e-4. Yutu-2 is so labelled because it is the successor to Yutu-1 which was deployed from the Chang'e-3 mission earlier this decade.  Queqiao is the relay satellite and translates to Magpie Bridge.This name also stems from Ancient Chinese mythology.Queqiao, or the Magpie Bridge, is a legendary bridge which appears once a year to connect Niu Lang and Zhi Nv.Niu Lang is a cattle herder on Earth while Zhi Nv, or the Weaving Maid, is a goddess in heaven.The couple met and fell in love when Zhi Nv snuck to the 'human world' in secret to play. Their union enraged the chief goddess, Queen Mother of the West.The couple got banished to live at different sides of the Milky Way.Every year on the seventh day of the seventh month on the Lunar Calendar, thousands of magpies that are moved by the couples' love story will form the Magpie Bridge, or Queqiao, so that Niu Lang and Zhi Nv can meet each other. This relay satellite will allow communication between the moon probe and Earth.  China's space agency previously said the current mission 'lifted the mysterious veil' from the far side of the moon, which is never seen from Earth, and 'opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration'.Because the space craft is solar powered, it has to switch off during a lunar night on the moon, during which there will be no sunlight.The temperature on a lunar night is about -180°C (-292°F) and can get high during the day, where 'insulating' components like the gold coloured layers outside the lander and rover keep them cool.Results of experiments from the mission could lead to new understandings of the challenges faced by settlers who may one day colonise our natural satellite. Israel attempted to land on the moon earlier this year but the mission ended in disaster when the Beresheet spacecraft fell into an uncontrolled descent.

The organisers had brought gas masks and the cloud-shaped trophies to the event.",Times Now,"Surat: If you are a social media aficionado, you probably stumbled upon several notifications and updates about a bizarre competition that was being organised in Surat. The 'What The Fart (WTF)' farting contest, conceptualised by Yatin Sangoi, aimed to judge how loud and melodic fart sounds are.  While the much-hyped event did take place at a banquet hall on Sunday, only 3 out of 200 participants showed up.Yes, the competition that was searching for the biggest ‘Padshah’ ran out of gas and turned out to be a disappointing affair.According to reports, over 200 people from Mumbai, Delhi,  Jaipur, and even Dubai had signed up to participate in the competition. However, the turnout was so low, that the gas masks and the cloud-shaped trophies remained untouched.Sushil Jain, the first participant, had travelled all the way from Bholardi for an hour on an empty stomach. He took a few sips of the milk tea that was being served at the banquet hall before ascending the stage to perform. But every time he did so, the stipulated time would expire without any emission.The local participant, Vishu Heda, walked out with a cash prize of Rs 2,500 despite having failed to fart even once.When the contest ended, the organiser Yatin Sangoi joked the participants couldn’t perform due to  “performance pressure”. Sangoi’s had previously said that his intention was to ‘normalise the process’ of farting because he thought it had become too sophisticated with many considering it to as an act too gross. He added that many are even shamed publicly despite the fact that farting is one of the healthiest body functions.Several visitors, who were potential participants, decided not to contest out of shyness, said Sangoi. Sangoi even invited Dr Rajesh Chandhani, a surgeon,  to attend to emergencies, if there were any. Unfortunately, his presence was not enough to attract participants.“People think it's bad to fart. It is socially unacceptable. But it is not good to hold a fart long-term. It can lead to dementia and early forgetfulness,"" said Dr Chandhani. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/the-buzz/article/out-of-gas-only-3-out-of-200-participants-show-up-for-surats-much-hyped-farting-competition/493663?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Sources in the party said that the decision was taken after several MPs and senior state party leaders demanded tickets for their kin for the elections.It may be noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has time and again targeted opposition parties in Haryana including Congress, INLD and Jannayak Janata Party for supporting dynastic politics.""We have decided that relatives of MPs, mayors and district Council heads won't get tickets in the upcoming assembly elections.

It is learnt that both Khattar and Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala were of a clear view that the party should not promote dynastic politics in the state. State party leaders reiterated that there is no place for dynastic politics in the BJP and only people committed to the party's ideology and the cause will be fielded in the polls.The BJP feels that giving tickets to the kin of its leaders would send a wrong message to its cadre ahead of the Assembly polls.

268,50% of our cryptocurrency Libra to be backed by US dollar: Facebook,"Facebook in a letter to German politician Fabio De Masi said the US dollar will represent 50% of the backing for its Libra cryptocurrency. The remaining support will come from euro (18%), Japanese yen (14%), British pound (11%) and Singapore dollar (7%). Libra will let users buy things or send money to people with nearly zero fees, Facebook had said.",Engadget,"Facebook was quick to promise that its Libra cryptocurrency would have the stability of real-world money behind it, but whose money will dominate?  It's now particularly clear.  Facebook sent a letter to German politician Fabio De Masi explaining that the US dollar will represent 50 percent of the backing for Libra.  The remaining support will come from the euro (18 percent), Japanese yen (14 percent), British pound (11 percent) and Singapore dollar (7 percent).  If you were hoping for currency representation from more parts of the world, you'll be disappointed.This isn't surprising given Facebook's home turf and the usual strength of the US dollar.  The absence of certain currencies might work in Libra's favor, too. The absence of China's yuan could appease American politicians scrutinizing the currency by assuaging their fears of Chinese influence.  US officials have long accused China of softening the yuan to help its exports, and Libra's mix would make that a non-issue.Whether or not this balance (or rather imbalance) helps is another matter.  The backing should prevent the volatility that has plagued Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but France, Germany and other countries are worried Libra might undermine their own financial systems.  Rock-solid support might not matter so much if Libra isn't available in key countries, especially those countries that are supposed to underpin the virtual money in the first place.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/22/facebook-libra-currency-backing/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Mnangagwa told ruling party supporters in New York where he is attending this week’s United Nations General Assembly that Mugabe had cancer, but he did not disclose the type. Mugabe is still to be buried because the government is building a mausoleum at Zimbabwe’s national shrine reserved for liberation war fighters in the capital. His body is being kept at his Blue Roof residence in Harare.     “Treatment had stopped, doctors had stopped treatment, chemotherapy, one, because of age and also because the cancer had spread and it was not helping anymore,” Mnangagwa said in comments carried by The Herald newspaper on Monday.

289,Reliance Capital criticises CARE for downgrading debt rating,"Reliance Capital has criticised CARE Ratings for downgrading its debt to default grade 'D', adding the ""unjustified"" move will harm the interests of millions of investors. CARE had cited one-day delay in coupon payments on NCDs by Reliance Capital to lenders for the cut, which Reliance attributed to ""technical glitch in bank servers"". CARE ""arbitrarily disregarded"" the explanation, Reliance said.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Debt-laden Reliance Capital Ltd has slammed an Indian credit rating agency’s decision to downgrade its debt to “default” levels and warned the move would harm millions of investors. CARE Ratings late on Friday downgraded the non-banking financial company’s (NBFC) bonds to ‘D’ from ‘BB’, citing a one-day delay in coupon payments on several non-convertible debentures and stress in the group’s liquidity position. Reliance, headed by business tycoon Anil Ambani, however, said funds had been arranged by the due date and the delay was due to technical glitches in the bank’s servers. CARE “arbitrarily disregarded” the explanation and gave the company no opportunity to comment on the rating rationale, Reliance said in a statement to stock exchanges on Saturday. “The highly unprofessional, biased and prejudiced and unjustified actions of CARE will precipitate a chain sequence of events that will gravely harm the interests of millions of retail and institutional investors having direct and indirect exposure to securities of the company,” it said. CARE did not respond to requests for comment. The rating agency’s move may exacerbate fears of further stress in India’s shadow banking sector, which has faced a liquidity crunch following the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) a year ago. PwC resigned as Reliance Capital’s auditor in June, citing what it called a lack of information from the company. Reliance Capital said it had duly responded to the auditor’s queries.

I was lucky enough to have had all that! I had my baby in a warm water pool, my husband, my mother, my doctor and my doula were there with me. I prepared myself for that day, I worked out regularly, I ate a very well balanced diet, I meditated and visualised every single detail.

301,Make climate fight sexy and fun: Japan's new environment minister,"Japan's new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, on Sunday pledged to mobilise young people to push his coal-dependent country toward a low-carbon future by making the fight against climate change ""sexy"" and ""fun"". ""We are committed to realising a decarbonised society, and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change,"" he added.",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japan’s new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, pledged on Sunday to mobilize young people to push his coal-dependent country toward a low-carbon future by making the fight against climate change “sexy” and “fun.” Koizumi was speaking on the eve of a United Nations climate summit in New York where activists plan to float a blimp showing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe emerging from a bucket of coal to protest Japan’s pans to build new coal-fired power plants. “In politics there are so many issues, sometimes boring. On tackling such a big-scale issue like climate change, it’s got to be fun, it’s got to be cool. It’s got to be sexy too,” Koizumi told a news conference in New York. “We are committed to realizing a decarbonised society, and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change,” he said. Japanese students in Tokyo were among the millions of young people who took to the streets on Friday to express the fear and outrage they feel over the failure of governments to control greenhouse gas emissions, which hit a record high last year. Considered a rising star on Japan’s political scene, Koizumi, 38, became the third youngest lawmaker to join a post-World War Two Japanese cabinet when Abe announced a reshuffle this month. The son of charismatic former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, he is regularly rated by voters as the lawmaker they would most like to see in the top job when Abe steps down.  Although Japan is not due to speak at the climate summit on Monday, Koizumi said he was in New York to learn more about the state of negotiations on global greenhouse gas emissions and meet Japanese students. He was speaking alongside Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming, who had invited him to meet various companies and banks aiming to accelerate investment in clean energy projects in Asia.  “It behooves the rest of the world to come together to support Japan, as well as the other Asian countries, to move beyond coal,” said Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who now leads Mission 2020, a campaign to accelerate climate action. “We need to make an extraordinary effort that will favor the new fuels that we all need to move in to,” she said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has told governments they should only turn up to the summit if they came armed with more ambitious plans to cut carbon emissions under the Paris accord, which enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Guterres has also urged governments not to build any new coal power plants after 2020 - setting him at odds with Japan, which is the only G7 country to be adding coal-fired power generation capacity. Japan’s government and banks also play an important role in financing new coal plants elsewhere in Asia. Nevertheless, Koizumi said he wanted Japan to do more on climate, invoking his country’s role in forging the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty agreed in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997.  “We haven’t taken the strong action and powerful leadership since then, but from now on, from today, we want to do more,” Koizumi said, without giving details. Koizumi sparked controversy shortly after being appointed when he told his first news conference that he wants Japan to close down nuclear reactors to avoid a repeat of the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011. Isshu Sugawara, newly-appointed as trade minister, responded by saying it would be unrealistic to rid Japan of nuclear power. Koizumi reiterated his opposition to nuclear power on Sunday. “I want to realize a society, a country, with no fear about the nuclear crisis,” he said. “But it isn’t easy, it’s a complicated issue. But I’ll try my best to reduce the nuclear power in the future.” Reporting by Matthew Green; Editing by Daniel Wallis",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-un-japan/make-climate-fight-sexy-says-japans-new-environment-minister-idUSKBN1W70PQ?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Recently, Shahid Kapoor was present at an event where he talked about his career, the massive success of Kabir Singh and more. When asked about the film and how he approached the character, Shahid Kapoor explained, ""If you think cinema is an educational institution that you're taught what you should or should not to do, that's your choice. Cinema is meant to mirror life. It's about representing the truth. It's an adult film, for adults, who can distinguish between right and wrong. Are you telling me that Mr Bachchan is someone who taught people to be a thief? You know you're going to watch a movie right, it's fiction, right? I've seen situations like this in life. When a couple fights, if a third person views it, they'll have a different idea. Fundamentally, they're in love. I've seen independent women date simple boys, and vice versa. That's how life is, it's unpredictable. Why is there a problem? You choose to take away what you want from the film. That's what democracy is all about.""He further added, We promoted the film for two months. If someone's bought a ticket, they probably wanted to see something in it. The film is about a flawed character. Preeti (Kiara Advani) is a stronger character than Kabir. Kabir doesn't know how to handle himself. Every Kabir needs a Preeti in his life. No one brought up Baazigar, when SRK kills Shilpa Shetty. No one said anything about Ranbir Kapoor putting a commode seat on Sonam Kapoor's neck as a mangalsutra in Sanju. Sab Kabir Singh ke peeche kyun pade hain?

The actress said that after Veer and her dance number Character Dheela Hai, nothing changed for her until Hate Story happened. She added, ""Hate Story was not an easy decision to make because I didn’t know whether people would accept me in such a bold role. But it turned out to be one of my biggest films. Public perception changes with every film. That’s the best part of being an actor. The plan is to look different in every film.""

366,Thousands march for ban on abortions in Slovakia,"Thousands marched in Slovakia's capital Bratislava on Sunday calling for a ban on abortions in the country. On-demand abortions are allowed up until 12 weeks of pregnancy while abortions for health reasons are allowed until 24 weeks. Protesters carried signs saying ""A human is human regardless of size"" and ""Who kills an unborn child kills the future of the nation"".",Reuters,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands marched in Slovakia’s capital on Sunday calling for a total ban on abortions in the predominantly Catholic central European country. Abortion laws in Slovakia are relatively liberal compared to those in countries like Poland or Malta, which have among the strictest laws in the European Union and often allow them only in cases like rape.  In Slovakia, on-demand abortions are legal up until 12 weeks of a pregnancy while abortions for health reasons are allowed until 24 weeks.  Conservative and far-right lawmakers want to allow them only to up to six or eight weeks of pregnancy or ban them outright, and parliament starts debating draft laws to restrict abortions this month. It is unclear if the proposals will become law since the ruling Smer - a leftist, socially conservative party - and junior center-right Slovak National Party in the government, have not said whether they will back any of them. Abortions have fallen in the country of 5.4 million to 6,000 last year, from almost 11,000 a decade ago. A Focus agency opinion poll this month found 55.5% of people disagreed with restricting abortions while 34.6% supported the move. Protesters carrying signs saying “A human is human regardless of size” and “Who kills an unborn child kills the future of the nation” marched in the capital on Sunday demanding a total ban on abortions, including in cases of severe birth defects or rape.  “The life of every human is invaluable, therefore it needs to be protected from conception until natural death,” one of the protest organizers, backed by the Catholic church, said on stage.  The organizers estimated turnout at the protest at about 50,000.   The ruling Smer party has led Slovakia nearly non-stop since 2006 and has built its base by lifting social benefits amid years of economic growth and backing conservative issues.  Ahead of an election next year, the party pledged to back legislation to ban gay marriage and adoption by same-sex couples. Slovak law does not recognize same-sex civil unions. The most recent official census in 2011 found 62% of the country identify as Roman Catholics, while 6% are Protestants.

367,Biden urges investigation into Trump's call to Ukrainian Prez,Former US Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday called for an investigation into reports that US President Donald Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani alleged Biden tried to have Ukraine's top prosecutor ousted in 2016 because of an investigation into a company whose board Hunter sat on.,Reuters,"By Amanda Becker and Jonathan Landay DES MOINES, Iowa/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, on Saturday called for an investigation into reports that President Donald Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. “This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power. To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things … this is outrageous,” a visibly angry Biden said while campaigning in Iowa. “Trump is using this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum and is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden said. Trump’s July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is at the center of an escalating battle over a whistleblower’s complaint reportedly concerning the U.S. leader’s dealings with Ukraine that the administration has refused to give Congress. The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets on Friday said Trump repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Biden, while vice president, threatened to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden’s son was involved was fired. Trump, reports said, urged Zelenskiy, a comedian who had just won election, to speak with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, has promoted the allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter, and acknowledged that he pressed for a Ukrainian investigation. Biden has admitted threatening to withhold aid unless the prosecutor was dismissed, a demand also made by the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases. The news reports about the Zelenskiy phone call have intensified demands by Democratic lawmakers for the House of Representatives to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, and have elevated the controversy to a major campaign issue. Trump denied doing anything improper. He wrote in a series of tweets on Saturday that his conversation with Zelenskiy was “perfectly fine and routine.” He accused the “Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party” of staying “as far away as possible” from the Biden allegations. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko on Saturday denied in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet suggestions that Trump had pressured Zelenskiy. Biden, responding to a reporter’s question at the Polk County Democratic Party’s annual steak fry in Des Moines, denied that he had ever spoken to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine. “You should be looking at Trump. Everybody looked at this and everybody who’s looked at it said there’s nothing there. Ask the right question,” continued Biden. “You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?” Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of Biden’s main rivals in the Democratic primary race, reiterated in Des Moines that she believes Trump’s reported actions should be the subject of impeachment proceedings in the U.S. House of Representatives. “It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now,” Warren said in remarks at the steak fry. At the steak fry, Biden called on voters to oust Trump but did not mention Ukraine. “Above all else we must defeat Donald Trump period and stop his abuse of power,” Biden said. The House Intelligence Committee is demanding it be given the whistleblower’s complaint in line with a finding by the inspector general for the intelligence community that the matter met the legal threshold for transmission to Congress. Acting Director of National Security Joseph Maguire, however, decided against providing the complaint to the committee after he consulted with the Justice Department, and reportedly the White House. Maguire and his top lawyer contended the complaint did not meet the legal guidelines for submission to the committee, prompting Democrats to accuse Maguire of breaking the law. Three House committees already were investigating the Trump-Zelenskiy call in part because the Ukrainian government’s readout of the call appeared to show that he had encouraged Zelenskiy to pursue a Biden investigation.

368,Afghan Taliban meets Chinese Government in Beijing,"A Taliban delegation met China's special representative for Afghanistan Deng Xijun in Beijing on Sunday to discuss the group's peace talks with the United States, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said. ""The Chinese special representative said the US-Taliban deal is a good framework for the peaceful solution of the Afghan issue and they support it,"" Shaheen added.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - A Taliban delegation met China’s special representative for Afghanistan in Beijing to discuss the group’s peace talks with the United States, a spokesman for the Islamist insurgency said. The meeting, on Sunday, comes after U.S. President Donald Trump’s 11th-hour cancellation earlier this month of negotiations with the Taliban, which many had hoped would pave the way to a broader peace deal with the Afghan government and ending an 18-year war. The Taliban’s nine-member delegation traveled to Beijing and met Deng Xijun, China’s special representative for Afghanistan, said Suhail Shaheen, the Afghan group’s spokesman in Qatar, on his official Twitter account on Sunday. Qatar was where the Taliban and the United States held peace talks over the past year. “The Chinese special representative said the U.S.-Taliban deal is a good framework for the peaceful solution of the Afghan issue and they support it,” Shaheen wrote. Mullah Baradar, the Taliban delegation’s leader, said they had held a dialogue and reached a “comprehensive deal”, Shaheen tweeted. “Now, if the U.S. president cannot stay committed to his words and breaks his promise, then he is responsible for any kind of distraction and bloodshed in Afghanistan,” Baradar said, according to Shaheen. Speaking in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed that Baradar and several of his assistants came to China for exchanges in recent days. “China’s relevant foreign ministry official exchanged opinions with Baradar regarding the situation in Afghanistan and promoting Afghanistan’s peace and reconciliation process,” Geng said. Afghanistan will this coming week hold its fourth presidential elections since U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban from power in 2001. Those elections have gained importance since the collapse of the peace talks, as the negotiations could have led to the creation of an interim government, now a more distant prospect. In June, before the peace talks fell apart, another Taliban team went to China to meet with the government. At the time, a foreign ministry spokesman said China supported Afghans resolving their problems themselves through talks, and the visit was an important part of China promoting such peace talks. China’s far western region of Xinjiang shares a short border with Afghanistan. China has long worried about links between militant groups and what it says are Islamist extremists operating in Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur people, who speak a Turkic language. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday called on all countries to resist China’s demands to repatriate ethnic Uighurs, saying Beijing’s campaign in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang was an “attempt to erase its own citizens”.  Geng said Pompeo had slandered China, and that its policies in Xinjiang were fundamentally no different than what other countries had done to guard against extremism and terrorism. U.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the remote Xinjiang region. China, a close ally of Pakistan, has been deepening its economic and political ties with Kabul and is also using its influence to try to bring the two uneasy neighbors closer.

He said that some private online portal organisers were not showing the actual accounts for the sale of tickets and not paying the GST due to the State government.

The film industry too is not against the online sale of tickets by FDC.Talasani said that the State government was studying the new model and discussing with the stakeholders. If the sale of tickets were routed through the FDC site, the accounts would be accurate and the government would get its share of GST. Talasani even had reservations over the faulty accounts being submitted by several sites like Book My Show.The Minister also recalled that the government conducted raids on the race course thus, the betting tax increased from Rs 30 lakh in the past to Rs 3 crore now, per year.

The Essex Eagles, as the T20 team is known, had made it into the finals by beating Derbyshire in the second semi-final. They faced Worcestershire, who defeated Nottinghamshire in the first semi-final.The tournament was filled with excitement and amazing performances from the majority of the players, but the best of the best came from Essex Eagles’ captain Simon Harmer, who starred in both the knockout wins for his team. He had earlier picked 4/19 against Worcestershire in the semis and then managed to one-up himself in the finals, contributing with the bat as well as the ball.AdvertisementWorcestershire had been put in to bat after losing the toss, put on 145/9 with Rikki Wessels and Moeen Ali making scores in the 30s.

The Civil Services Mains exam is one such exam which is written by aspiring bureaucrats who have cleared the prelims for the same. UPSC conducts these exams every year across the country, and this year the mains exam is scheduled from September 20 to 29.In the General Studies Paper 1 given on Saturday morning, candidates were shocked to find a rather controversial question in their paper. The question was on the “challenges” to India's cultural practices “in the name of secularism.” This question, in an exam that looks for the future administrators of India, seemed to insinuate that secularism was an excuse which is posing challenges to the country's existing cultural practices.Commenting on the matter, Kannan Gopinathan – an IAS officer who quit the services recently over the clampdown in Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370, commented on Twitter: ""Indian secularism is a positive concept, taking along and encouraging all the cultural practices while instilling a scientific temper against superstitions and harmful practices."", would have been the first sentence of my answer!”""Indian secularism is a positive concept, taking along and encouraging all the cultural practices while instilling a scientific temper against superstitions and harmful practices."", would have been the first sentence of my answer! https://t.co/MUsCYlh0OZThis question comes as a part of a series of questions which prime candidates to think in a right-wing manner, alleges a student who wrote the exam on Saturday, requesting anonymity. ""A few questions before this one, they had asked, “What makes Indian society unique in sustaining its culture”; and a few questions before that, there was, “Did Indian renaissance play a role in the emergence of national identity” etc.,"" he says.Adding that there have been instances of UPSC doling out controversial questions earlier as well he says, ""Those would be neutrally worded. There is a subtle difference between wording it neutrally and loading it,"" he says.Slamming the UPSC for including such questions, the student said that the Commission needs to be pulled up for this. “I understand that the idea of secularism is under attack. But there is no academic consensus, nor is there a judicial consensus about this. Judiciary still says that secularism is a basic tenet of our Constitution. That is what we need to stick to. UPSC is a Constitutional body, not an independent think tank framing question for their intern. UPSC must stick to Constitutional values and definitely deserves brickbats for this,"" he says.Another student, who also wrote the exam on Saturday, says that the question was unexpected and antithetical to one's understanding of secularism. ""The question has a very limited scope. Apart from conflicts between the morality of a religion and the morality of a nation, there is not much to explain in the answer to this question,"" he says. He adds that this was one of the most difficult questions asked this time. ""This was a loaded question. interpretation of the question is a challenge in itself and then comes winding the arguments around the aspects asked in the question,"" he says.Ramesh Chennithala, former President of Kerala Congress and the present Leader of Opposition in Kerala also commented on the issue on his Twitter account by stating that UPSC is the latest casuality of RSS agenda. One of the most rated exam in the world UPSC,is the new casuality of the RSS agenda of instilling venom of communalism into the democratic institutions.#StopSaffronisingConstitutionalBodies pic.twitter.com/duMZBeSBilIts irony that the UPSC finds the term ""secularism"" which is part of the preamble of our Constitution, as challenging to Indian Culture.#StopSaffronisingConstitutionalBodies",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/loaded-question-upsc-asks-about-challenges-our-culture-name-secularism-109303?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

According to DroidLife, testers received an email about the rollout that says: ""Use Incognito Mode when you don't want your activity -- like the places you search for or navigate to -- to be saved to your Google account.""  The tech giant has been working to bring the feature to its other products for a while, releasing it for YouTube last year.In Maps, you can switch it on by tapping on your profile photo on the right corner of the search bar and choosing ""Turn on Incognito Mode"" from the options that pop up. The app will then confirm your status with a black bar at the top of the screen that says ""Incognito Mode is on."" Coming soon to @googlemaps, when you turn on Incognito mode in Maps, your activity—like the places you search or get directions to—won't be saved to your Google Account. Just tap from your profile picture to easily turn it on or off. #io19 pic.twitter.com/z7GRkkmDbn",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/19/google-incognito-mode-maps-test/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

394,Chinese delegation cancels goodwill visit to US farms,"Chinese officials in the US for trade talks cancelled their goodwill visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska. Reports earlier claimed an interim deal could be reached, involving China resuming purchase of US farm goods. However, US President Donald Trump later said he wants a ""complete trade deal"" and not just an agreement for China to buy American agricultural goods.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S.-China trade deal appeared elusive on Friday after Chinese officials unexpectedly canceled a visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska as deputy trade negotiators wrapped up two days of negotiations in Washington. Chinese officials were expected to visit U.S. farmers next week as a goodwill gesture, but canceled to return to China sooner than originally scheduled, agriculture organizations from Montana and Nebraska said. The United States had removed tariffs overnight from over 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies. The Chinese Embassy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office issued a brief statement characterizing the two days as “productive” and that a principal-level trade meeting in Washington would take place in October as previously planned.  China’s Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described the talks as “constructive”, and said they had also had a good discussion on “detailed arrangements” for the high-level talks in October. “Both sides agreed to continue to maintain communication on the relevant issues,” it added, without elaborating. Trade experts, executives and government officials in both countries say that even if the September and October talks produced an interim deal, the U.S.-China trade war has hardened into a political and ideological battle that runs far deeper than tariffs and could take years to resolve. The Chinese delegation did not present any new proposals on core structural issues including intellectual property protections, forced technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers, said a person briefed on the talks.  “The conclusion from the U.S. side was that we’re not close to an agreement,” the person said. This source and another person familiar with the talks said that the Chinese delegation’s leader, Vice Finance Minister Liao Min, laid out China’s demands that any deal must remove all U.S. tariffs and be balanced so that it is not all concessions from Beijing and none from Washington.  The sources said that a lack of results from deputy meetings is not uncommon as they often are not authorized to make deals or present new offers. The early October meeting will include the top trade negotiators: Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It is expected to determine whether the world’s two largest economies are starting to chart a path out of their 14-month trade war or headed for new and higher tariffs on each others’ goods. Cancellation of the Chinese agriculture visits, which were seen as potentially leading to increased purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork, caused Wall Street’s main stock indexes to fall as early optimism about the talks faded.  Grain and soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade and livestock futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also slumped. China is the world’s largest pork market and the largest importer of soybeans. Before the talks started, some reports had suggested that an interim deal was being considered, involving Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods, some improvements in Chinese market access and an easing of U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd But U.S. President Donald Trump made clear on Friday that purchases would not be enough for him to end his punitive tariffs.  “We’re looking for a complete deal. I’m not looking for a partial deal,” he told reporters, adding that he did not need a deal to happen before the 2020 presidential election. Speaking at a White House meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Trump touted the billions of dollars in U.S. tariff receipts on Chinese imports, adding that the total would soon reach $100 billion. “I will say this: we’re making a lot of progress with China,” the Republican president said. The Trump administration and China’s Communist Party remain far apart on issues that are the basis of their trade dispute, including the U.S. declaring some Chinese state companies national security risks, and Beijing’s refusal to revamp its economic model by eliminating subsidies for state companies. USTR issued three Federal Register notices on Friday to exclude a wide range of products from tariffs in response to requests from U.S. companies, which argued that the levies would cause economic hardship. The 437 exempted products range from printed circuit boards for computer graphics processors to dog collars, laminated wood flooring and miniature Christmas lights. The United States is asking that China substantially increase purchases of American soybeans and other farm commodities, a person with knowledge of the planned discussions told Reuters.

402,Thought selling fashion online was a stupid idea: Jabong Co-founder,"Manu Kumar Jain, who co-founded Jabong in 2011, in a recent podcast said that his first thought on selling fashion online was that it was a ""stupid idea"". He said he was surprised that people were willing to buy shoes and clothes online. He quit Jabong in 2014 and is currently Global VP of Xiaomi and MD of Xiaomi India.",YourStory,"We continue with the #InsightsPodcast series, and on this edition we have with us Manu Kumar Jain, Managing Director of Xiaomi India, a leader in smartphones, televisions, and many other products.Manu walks us through the journey of setting up Xiaomi in India and scaling it to become one of the best mobile phone brands in India in a very capital-efficient way.Revisiting his childhood days, Manu remembers growing up in Meerut in a large family with a business background, where the ultimate aspiration was to set up shop. The larger the shop, the more successful one was.Unlike most of his cousins, Manu decided to pursue engineering from IIT-Delhi and then did his MBA from IIM-Calcutta, after which he worked with Mckinsey for five years before co-founding Jabong. He ran Jabong for two years before moving out and then joined Xiaomi to start their India business.After some persuasion from his co-founders, he was able to take the leap of faith, only to get pleasantly surprised that a lot of people were willing to buy shoes and clothes online. Riding on the wave of mobile-first online consumers, Jabong grew from 1,000 orders a day to 10,000 orders a day, to become a top two player in the online fashion space.Hugely fascinated with mobile as a category and having heard about a Chinese company trying to do things differently by using online as the primary channel for sales, Manu connected with the founders through his network out of pure interest to learn more about the company’s journey. After multiple exchanges between Manu and the founders, sharing learnings with each other on the China and India landscape, Lin Bin, Co-Founder and President of Xiaomi, offered Manu the chance to join them to start their India business.At a time when India had more than 300 smartphone brands, Xiaomi went ahead with an online-only sales strategy when everyone else was spending huge marketing dollars on advertising and sponsorships. From very early on, the expectation from the board was to be profitable and not burn at a day-to-day operations level.“We can’t make more than five percent margin from any of our hardware products by board resolution. We believe in a concept called honest price. We cut down all possible costs like marketing, distribution, working capital, and inventory cost, and pass on that benefit to the user, without keeping a profit margin for ourselves.”The strategy couldn’t have worked better, the phones went out of stock in seconds on launch days, leading ecommerce partner Flipkart’s site to crash. Xiaomi went on to capture almost 50 percent market share in the online channel - that by itself grew from 6 percent to 33 percent of total mobile phone sales in India. By the second year, Xiaomi was able to record billion dollar worth of sales while remaining profitable.In 2017, Xiaomi made its foray into offline through exclusive Mi stores. The focus on profitability continued as Xiaomi opened stores that were not so large that they hurt the store partner’s profitability; most stores achieved profitability in six months of launch. Today, Xiaomi has 6,000 stores across India and the offline channel contributes to 30 percent of their sales.On things that worked for Xiaomi, Manu says hiring smart, young and passionate people irrespective of their background helped. “They were never bogged down by what other people or industry experts were saying. They were willing to take risks and do things differently. If you're looking to disrupt and do things differently then you cannot have the traditional industry mindset.”The culture at Xiaomi is that of encouraging fast decision making, challenging status quo, and giving an equal platform to everyone to voice their opinion. Xiaomi’s journey has not been one without mistakes and that is something they have ingrained into their work culture.Sharing learnings for young entrepreneurs, Manu talks about the importance of having mentors who do not have a vested interest in your company or you, so that the conversations are brutal and honest.Last but not the least, Manu stresses on the importance of investing in the team and ensuring that good performers grow within the company, from both and equity and cash perspective. Spending time with the team has always been one of the top three priorities for Manu.Tune in to the podcast to hear more interesting insights from Manu’s journey of scaling Xiaomi.Anand Daniel is a seed/early stage venture investor with Accel Partners.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)",https://yourstory.com/2019/09/accel-podcast-manu-kumar-jain-jabong-xiaomi-anand-daniel?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Eight of the hostages died, five escaped, and Iran freed four last year.",Reuters,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - An Iranian sailor held hostage by Somali pirates was dying of malnutrition, a former British army officer who helped negotiate his release told Reuters on Sunday. Three other Iranian hostages remain in Somalia.  “This guy was dying – he looked like a skeleton. He was bleeding internally. He had severe malnutrition. I suspect the others are in a similar condition,” John Steed, a retired British colonel, said. Steed has worked in the region for many years trying to free Somali hostages.  Mohammad Sharif Panahandeh was among 21 crew members of a boat hijacked in March 2015. Eight of the hostages died, five escaped, and Iran freed four last year. The hostages had been split up by their captors after arguments over money, said Steed. Panahandeh was released without payment because the pirates thought he would die.  “He was released last weekend but we  had him in (the northern Somali town of) Galkayo trying to get him fit to travel. A week of trying to get him fit to travel. We had to stabilize him,” Steed said. “Nobody wants to pay for these guys because they are Baluchi,” he added. Poverty-stricken Baluchistan straddles the border between Iran and Pakistan and is riven by banditry and insurgency. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Saturday that the United Nations and Steed’s humanitarian group, the Hostage Support Partnership, helped with the release.  Mousavi also thanked authorities in Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland and in Ethiopia for their help in winning the release of Panahandeh, the state news agency IRNA said.  Three Iranians sailors are still being held, Mousavi said. “We are happy to announce we have obtained the release of one of the last hostages of Somali piracy ... 3 more seafarers remain who need our help,” Hostage Support Partnership tweeted.  Piracy off Somalia’s coast spiked in 2012 but then sharply subsided, mainly because shipping firms put better security protocols into place, including posting lookouts, sailing further away from Somalia, and hiring private security.

412,Facebook buys Israeli hybrid chatbot startup Servicefriend,"Facebook has acquired Israel-based hybrid chatbot startup Servicefriend, to reportedly build customer service bots for its planned digital wallet 'Calibra'. Co-founded in 2015 by Ido Arad and Shahar Ben Ami, the startup provides hybrid AI-based bot technology to enterprises for the purpose of customer service. The co-founders have apparently joined Facebook within the Calibra group.",TechCrunch,"As Facebook  prepares to launch its new cryptocurrency Libra in 2020, it’s putting the pieces in place to help it run. In one of the latest developments, it has acquired Servicefriend, a startup that built bots — chat clients for messaging apps based on artificial intelligence — to help customer service teams, TechCrunch has confirmed.The news was first reported in Israel, where Servicefriend is based, after one of its investors, Roberto Singler, alerted local publication The Marker about the deal. We reached out to Ido Arad, one of the co-founders of the company, who referred our questions to a team at Facebook. Facebook then confirmed the acquisition with an Apple-like non-specific statement:“We acquire smaller tech companies from time to time. We don’t always discuss our plans,” a Facebook spokesperson said.Several people, including Arad, his co-founder Shahar Ben Ami, and at least one other indicate that they now work at Facebook within the Calibra digital wallet group on their LinkedIn profiles. Their jobs at the social network started this month, meaning this acquisition closed in recent weeks. (Several others indicate that they are still at Servicefriend, meaning they too may have likely made the move as well.)Although Facebook isn’t specifying what they will be working on, the most obvious area will be in building a bot — or more likely, a network of bots — for the customer service layer for the Calibra  digital wallet that Facebook is developing.Facebook’s plan is to build a range of financial services for people to use Calibra to pay out and receive Libra — for example, to send money to contacts, pay bills, top up their phones, buy things and more.It remains to be seen just how much people will trust Facebook as a provider of all these. So that is where having “human” and accessible customer service experience will be essential.“We are here for you,” Calibra notes on its welcome page, where it promises 24-7 support in WhatsApp and Messenger for its users.Servicefriend has worked on Facebook’s platform in the past: specifically it built “hybrid” bots for Messenger for companies to use to complement teams of humans, to better scale their services on messaging platforms. In one Messenger bot that Servicefriend built for Globe Telecom in the Philippines, it noted that the hybrid bot was able to bring the “agent hours” down to under 20 hours for each 1,000 customer interactions.Bots have been a relatively problematic area for Facebook. The company launched a personal assistant called M in 2015, and then bots that let users talk to businesses in 2016 on Messenger, with quite some fanfare, although the reality was that nothing really worked as well as promised, and in some cases worked significantly worse than whatever services they aimed to replace.While AI-based assistants such as Alexa have become synonymous with how a computer can carry on a conversation and provide information to humans, the consensus around bots these days is that the most workable way forward is to build services that complement, rather than completely replace, teams.For Facebook, getting its customer service on Calibra right can help it build and expand its credibility (note: another area where Servicefriend has build services is in using customer service as a marketing channel).

416,Mu Sigma to pay $2.5 million to settle US visa case,Analytics firm Mu Sigma has agreed to pay $2.5 million in an out-of-court settlement in a visa fraud dispute. It was found that the firm was circumventing US visa regulations by flying in Indian employees on a B-1 visitor visa and misrepresenting the nature of their intended visit to the US. The investigation began in 2013 following a whistleblower's tip-off.,Entrackr,"Advanced analytics service provider MU Sigma has entered into an out of court settlement with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) and paid $2.5 million in fines for B1 visa fraud. In a joint investigation conducted by US ICE, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), it was found that the management consulting firm was circumventing US visa regulations by flying in Indian employees on a B1 visitor visa and misrepresenting the nature of their intended visit to the United States.Mu Sigma, which has its US headquarter in Chicago, Illinois, operates in conjunction with its main delivery centre in Bangalore. The company was found to be employing B1 visitor visa holders under contract within the U.S. Further, the Mu Sigma’s invitation letters for the B1 visa holder employees have falsified information about their nature of the visit to the US. It even went to the extremes of instructing potential B1 business visitors and company handlers how to avoid detection by U.S consular and border officials. However, the company’s shady tactics did not stop there. According to a release by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE),  investigators found out that Mu Sigma’s employees, who were illegally working there were not paid in the US at the standard wage rate their US counterparts get. Instead, the company only paid them in India at a substantially lower India-based wage rate. The company even forced its employees to sign bond contracts that unlawfully sought reimbursement of up to $10,000 of the H-1B visa costs if an employee ceased employment before an agreed-upon date.The company used this unlawful tactic to inflate their profit margins and to be able to bid super low for contracts against US-based companies.The investigation was started back in 2013 after a whistleblower, who was a Mu Sigma employee tipped off US ICE that Mu Sigma managers were violating US government’s H-1B visa regulations by illegally employing B1 visitor visa holders under contact.This company was found to have incurred about 400 potential B1 visa violations and had issued more than 300 illegal visa bond contracts, during the defined period. Special agents also identified that at least 9 Mu Sigma senior executives and managers were actively participating in the wrongdoings. On Aug 28, 2019, HSI’s reached a $2.5 million final global settlement with Mu Sigma for allegations of H1B and B1 visa abuse. Of the $2.5 million settlement, $1.6 million will satisfy the civil allegations, and $900,000 will satisfy the criminal allegations. In addition to the monetary compensation, the non-prosecution agreement includes a compliance and monitoring program.",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/mu-sigma-settlement-2-5million-us-visa-authorities/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The 25-year-old added that OYO accepts the issues and is ready to resolve them and change.",YourStory,"OYO Hotels and Homes founder Ritesh Agarwal’s journey from a college drop out to building a global brand is well known. Ritesh, who left his home to startup when he was just 19, always wanted to be an entrepreneur. According to him, options for comfortable and standardised travel and stay for the middle-class Indian was limited.Ritesh Agarwal, with the OYO TeamAnd in just five years, the Gurugram-based unicorn is the fastest-growing chain of leased and franchised hotels, homes, and living spaces. In a short span, Oyo has grown from 300 cities with 10,000+ hotels, 200,000+ rooms to over 500 cities, with over 18,000 hotels and 270,000 rooms in India. It has also acquired several Indian and European startups. A global brand, it recently announced that it has reached a new milestone in the US, where it has over 100 hotels in over 21 states and 60 cities. The hospitality startup is backed by the SoftBank Group, Greenoaks Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Lightspeed India.In its short life, OYO Hotels and Homes has been variously described as a hotel aggregator, an online travel agency (OTA), and even a Ponzi scheme with an unsustainable business model, but never a hotel chain. And today, the tables have turned, and it is a different story. Oyo is now valued at $5 billion. “In 2015-16, we were locked in a big competitive battle, and there was little bandwidth for us to immediately start on franchising and leasing model because that needs time and effort,” Ritesh recalls. The 26-year-old entrepreneur was referring to the days when OYO controlled and managed just a few rooms in a hotel, and not the entire property. While the ubiquitous red-and-white boards outside announced to the world that the buildings were OYO properties, the reality was that it controlled only a few rooms. Despite the $1 billion in funding it mopped up in 2018 from Softbank, the journey hasn’t been easy. Growing at breakneck speed, OYO faced just about every challenge that a rapidly scaling startup does - complaints about the quality of properties and services, messed-up reservations, and customer complaints going viral on social media. A full-stack franchising and leasing model has given OYO control over the customer experience. But this also means being operationally intensive – hiring, training, monitoring, and retaining service staff. “The vision of creating a better living space for the common man remains even today to what it was five years back.”(Edited by Megha Reddy)",https://yourstory.com/2019/09/turning-point-oyo-hotels-aggregator-ritesh-agarwal?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He wrote that feelings of lakhs of devotees were hurt. Singh has asked his minister son to shift the slaughterhouse to another location.",The New Indian Express,"BHOPAL: Former Madhya Pradesh minister and Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh has written to his minister son Jaivardhan Singh to immediately stop implementation of previous BJP regime’s decision to build a slaughterhouse near a temple on Bhopal’s outskirts. The veteran politician is currently under attack from opposition BJP and right-wing Hindu groups over his recent “rapes inside temples” controversial remark,On Saturday, the septuagenarian Congress leader wrote a letter to his MP urban development minister son Jaivardhan Singh, mentioning that the former BJP government’s decision to build a slaughterhouse near a temple on outskirts of Bhopal has hurt the feelings of lakhs of devotees.In the letter, Singh has mentioned that many pilgrims visit the Kankali Temple during the Navratri. Not only is the temple is close to the Adampur Chhavni, the site of the slaughterhouse, but three more temples, including a Ram Temple and an ISCKON temple are located on the road leading to the Kankali Temple.During the previous BJP regime, a decision was taken to shift the existing slaughterhouse from Subhash Nagar to Adampur Chhavni (close to the Kankali Temple), which was opposed by the Congress workers at that time. The protests by Congress workers had forced then BJP regime to abandon the idea of building the slaughterhouse in Adampur Chhavni.But in 2017, the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) mayor and the then Chief Minister, overlooking the concerns of pilgrims and local residents, had gone ahead with the proposal and cleared the detailed project report (DPR) for building the slaughterhouse at Adampur Chhavni.“I’ve come to know that in pursuance of the previous BJP government’s decision, the BJP-ruled BMC has started the construction of the slaughterhouse, consequently hurting the sentiments of lakhs of devotees and pilgrims who will offer prayers at the Kankali Temple and other nearby temples during the coming Navratri. Lakhs of devotees are hurt by the BJP-ruled BMC to start construction of the slaughterhouse.”In the letter to his minister’s son, Singh has requested to immediately stop the implementation of the decision of the previous BJP regime by the presently BJP-ruled BMC. Further, Singh requested in the letter to shift the slaughterhouse facility elsewhere.The Congress politician’s letter to minister son assumed significance, particularly as it came just a few days after his “rapes happening inside temples” remark had triggered huge political controversy nationally, forcing even the national Congress to distance itself from his statements.On Tuesday, while addressing the Sant Samagam (conclave of Hindu seers) in presence of Chief Minister Kamal Nath in Bhopal, Singh had said “saffron-clad people are selling churan, while some people dressed in saffron robes were committing rapes and the rapes are happening inside temples. Is this our religion? God will not forgive those who have defamed our religion.”His remarks had possibly come after former BJP MP and a minister of the erstwhile Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Swami Chinmayanand, was accused by a 23-year-old student of sexual assault.Anti-Digvijaya Singh posters bearing his pictures had come out outside temples in some areas of Bhopal, appealing that Singh’s entry be banned in temples. ",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/sep/22/digvijaya-singh-writes-to-minister-son-to-stop-construction-of-slaughterhouse-near-goddess-temple-2037175.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

There is still plenty of work to do,” Kuldeep added.He said with Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in fray for Tests, he will have to utilise the limited chances he gets.“When three spinners like Ashwin, Jaddu and I are in the squad, it’s challenging to pick the right combination.

Asked about Pawar’s allegations the BJP-led government was issuing notices to sugar barons and pressurising them into joining the ruling camp, Fadnavis said, “Pawar Sahab used to do this and hence he thinks we also will do so. But there is a big difference between theirs and our brand of politics. We need not play the kind of politics Pawar Sahab played”. He added that Pawar once “made and broke parties”. “It was the charisma of time now that the same thing is happening to his party, the NCP, today.You need not cry foul now. The kind of politics you played, it will resonate and echo somewhere,” the chief minister said. With a string of desertions, the NCP, which was formed in 1999 by Pawar after walking out of the Congress, is facing its worst crisis in the state which it had ruled in allinace with the Congress for three consecutive terms since 2014. The CM said the BJP has inducted leaders/MLAs into his party party fold only after a background check. Leaders from NCP and Congress including Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, Udayanraje Bhosale, Ganesh Naik, Harshvardhan Patil, Shivendrasinh Bhosale, Kalidas Kolambkar, Vaibhav Pichad to name a few, have joined the BJP recently. When asked if he was the “Sharad Pawar of the 21st Century”, Fadnavis said he will rather play his own kind of politics. “The era of Sharad Pawar ji’s politics is over.The kind of politics he would play of making and breaking (of parties and MLAs) is over now. Such politics won’t work, generations have changed. People don’t accept such politics now,” Fadnavis said. The chief minister said leaders today identify themselves with the kind of politics being played by the BJP. “My government never faced any corruption charges unlike previous dispensations led by the Congress and the NCP,” he said, adding that allegations made against some members of the state Cabinet could not be proved.Meanwhile, Fadnavis said he would renounce politics if the allegation against him of transferring bank accounts of state police personnel to a private bank, where his wife holds a senior post, are proved. “The transfer of accounts happened in 2005 when the Congress-NCP combine was in power. I got married to Amruta in November 2005. I challenge any leader to prove charges against me…I will renounce politics if the charges are proved. If not, they should quit politics,” he added.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

474,Last reactor at worst US nuclear accident site finally closed,"American energy company Exelon Corp shut the last reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island power plant, site of the worst nuclear accident in American history on Friday. On March 28, 1979, the plant's second reactor experienced a cooling problem that resulted in the partial melting of the reactor and the evacuation of 14,000 people.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy company Exelon Corp (EXC.N) said it will shut the last reactor at the Three Mile Island power plant, site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, at noon local time on Friday. The company announced in May that it planned to shut the 45-year old unit in September due to inaction in the Pennsylvania legislature on a bill that would have subsidized the continued operation of nuclear power in the state. Paul Adams, a spokesman for Exelon, said the company will issue a statement later Friday on the planned closure. He noted Exelon never owned the unit that suffered the accident in 1979. Exelon said on its website it bought the 837-megawatt (MW) Unit 1 at Three Mile Island about 20 years after accident at Unit 2. Unit 2 is owned by FirstEnergy Corp (FE.N).  One megawatt can power about 1,000 average U.S. homes.  Nuclear services company EnergySolutions Inc said in July it was in negotiations with a unit of FirstEnergy to acquire and complete the decommissioning of Unit 2. In recent years, electricity prices have been depressed by cheap natural gas from shale fields, including the Marcellus in Pennsylvania, and by increased use of renewable power. This has reduced the amount of money power plants can make selling electricity and forced generators to shut several coal and nuclear plants in recent years. Many states, including New York, Illinois, Connecticut, New Jersey and Ohio have already adopted nuclear subsidies to keep their reactors in service to help meet carbon reduction and other goals. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania have considered legislation, but not in time for Three Mile Island. Exelon said it had to decide whether to spend the money to refuel the plant by June 1. In addition to the states, officials in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration have also proposed programs to keep nuclear and coal plants operating longer. Nuclear power plants generated about 39% of Pennsylvania’s electricity in 2018 and have provided over 90% of its zero-carbon power, according to federal and industry data. Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, Exelon operates two reactors at Peach Bottom and two at Limerick, FirstEnergy operates two reactors at Beaver Valley, and Talen Energy owns two at Susquehanna. FirstEnergy’s bankrupt FirstEnergy Solutions unit has said it would shut Beaver Valley in 2021 unless the reactors receive some financial support from federal or state programs.

479,Showing middle finger to women same as outraging her modesty: Delhi court,A court in Delhi has convicted a man for outraging the modesty of a woman after she accused him of showing her the middle finger and making obscene facial remarks. The court ruled flashing middle finger to a woman also amounts to outraging her modesty. The ruling was made in a case of an assault that took place in 2014.,Times Now,"New Delhi: While hearing a case concerning an assault which dates back to 2014, a judge in Delhi recently sentenced a man to jail. His crime, gesturing at a woman with his middle finger apart from making obscene facial expressions. The complainant, in this case, also alleged that the accused passed lewd remarks aimed at her and even slapped her.The matter was first brought to the attention of Delhi Police in May of 2014 by a woman who claimed that her brother-in-law showed her his middle finger apart from passing lewd remarks and physically assaulting her. An investigation into the matter resulted in police booking the accused under sections 509 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which correspond to punishment awarded for word gesture or lewd remarks meant to insult the modesty of a woman.On the basis of the police investigation, the court framed charges against the man on October 8, 2015. According to a report, the accused entered a plea of not guilty and decided to contest the allegations in a court of law. In the course of the trial, the prosecution examined as many as four witnesses, including the complainant. The woman, in her testimony, levelled the same allegations she had stated in her complaint.However, the accused consistently denied all of the allegations and termed them entirely baseless. In his defence, he claimed that the woman accused him of outraging her modesty owing to a property dispute between them. He even called his own sister to testify in his favor.Hearing the case, metropolitan magistrate Vasundhara Azad stated that the actions of the accused amounted to making utterances or gestures intended to outrage the modesty of a woman. She further cited the complainant's medico-legal case (MLC) report. This report showed a ""linear bruise"" on the woman's body. Furthermore, Azad said that the court did not find any evidence of a property dispute as claimed by the defendant. She also said that a conviction, in this case, can be based on the sole testimony of the survivor if the same was ""trustworthy"", ""reliable"" and ""worthy of credence"". Meanwhile, the court rejected the defence witness' testimony since the statements made by her could not be corroborated. The accused is now looking at a maximum punishment of three years in prison along with a fine. However, the quantum of the punishment will be announced on Tuesday.",https://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/society/article/showing-middle-finger-to-woman-amounts-to-outraging-her-modesty-rules-delhi-court/492650?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

PTM alleges extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances of Pashtuns and other ethnic minorities.",Reuters,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Two Pakistani parliamentarians and human rights campaigners were released on bail in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province after four months in detention, their lawyer said on Saturday.     The two lawmakers, Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar, along with several activists of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), were arrested after a deadly clash between troops and activists at a security post in northern Pakistan in May.     “Both the parliamentarians were released from Haripur jail after midnight,” Tariq Afghan, the lawyer for the two leaders told Reuters.     PTM campaigns against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances of Pashtuns and other ethic minorities. It emerged last year after the killing of an ethnic Pashtun man by police in the southern city of Karachi, which led to nationwide protests and turned the issue of alleged state violence against Pashtuns into a national debate. The military has accused the PTM of being funded by foreign intelligence agencies - a veiled reference to arch-foe India and its Afghan allies - to stoke unrest in Pakistan’s Pashtun lands after the Pakistani army defeated Islamist militants there. The PTM denies foreign links. On May 26, soldiers at a security post fired on a group of protesters led by PTM leaders and serving parliamentarians Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir, according to PTM representatives, who said 13 of their supporters were killed. The army said troops exchanged fire with the protesters when they attacked the checkpoint, and that three of the attackers were killed. On his release, Dawar posted a tweet describing the incident as a massacre. “In its aftermath, this State piled up even more violations of human rights, decency in its treatment of Ali and myself,” he said in the tweet on Saturday.

The Houthis have insisted they are responsible for a devastating Sept. 14 assault on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities that initially halved the kingdom’s production, but the United States and Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran.  Tehran, which support the Houthis, has denied any involvement in the attacks.     Speaking on the group’s Al Masirah TV, head of the Houthi political office Mahdi al-Mashat called for a halt to strikes on both sides and for serious talks among all players involved. “I call on all parties from different sides of the war to engage seriously in genuine negotiations that can lead to a comprehensive national reconciliation that does not exclude anyone,” said Mashat. The Saudi-led military coalition did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Houthi announcement. The Western-backed, Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the internationally recognized government in Sanaa in late 2014. Mashat said that the Houthis “would not hesitate to launch a period of great pain” if their call for peace was ignored. In the speech, Mashat boasted of the group’s rapidly improved military capabilities and said “significant advancement” would be seen in the coming period, particularly in air and missile defense. The Houthis said this week they had picked out dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh’s top Arab ally, as possible targets for future attacks.

Both my elder brothers are advocates, but I always wanted to play cricket,” Wasim, who sustained a leg injury when he was just nine, tells CricketCountry after the team was felicitated by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.Hailing from Kashmir, Wasim recalled how the current situation after scrapping Article 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir has affected cricket in the state. “There are no matches and whatever little tournaments that were taking place too have been shut,” the 26-year-old informed.READ: India’s World Series-winning physically disabled team to get cash reward from BCCI“It has affected my game as well, I really struggle hard to practice because there is nobody around.

I have taken plenty of tips from him and he has supported me a lot. Rasikh Salim (who played for Mumbai Indians this year), like my little brother, has also played with me.

Nitin Gadkari saab has asked us to keep performing and they will support us, so Inshaallah, I will keep performing,” he said.He might be passionate about cricket but as far as financial security goes, Wasim hopes to land a government job. “I’ve got a lot of offers from private companies, but if I get a government job, it will be the best.

This distinction became increasingly important as YouTube faced criticism for allowing the spread of hate speech and misinformation, with executives then defending the service as an open platform.So moving forward, YouTube said it would focus on verifying public figures, famous brands and well-known creators — rather than allowing any account with more than 100,000 subscribers to request verification.Been doing Youtube for 5 years, I post 2 videos a week, 950,000 subscribers…. YouTube emails me today that my channel has been “unverified” because the verified badge is only for well known channels with a large following  @TeamYouTube literally no one asked for this — Sierra Schultzzie (@Schultzzie) September 19, 2019As a result of the new policy, numerous YouTube creators (including some with millions of subscribers) were notified they would be losing their verified status. Naturally, they went public with their unhappiness. (The news also led to some false alarms, like complaints that popular YouTuber PewDiePie had lost his checkmark, when he had not.)While it remains to be seen how extensively YouTube will be revising or reversing its plans — and whether creators will be satisfied — this still seems like a clear mea culpa from YouTube leadership.Update, September 21: YouTube offered more details about its new plans, saying that channels with a verification badge will keep that badge without needing to appeal, and that channels with more than 100,000 subscribers will still be able to apply for verification. Due to all the changes, the new verification badge will now roll out next year.Here’s the email sent to creators:YouTube’s Neal Mohan is coming to Disrupt SF",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/youtube-verification-reversal/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

498,Government proposes social security benefits for gig workers,"The government in its draft social security code has proposed providing life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits, and old age protection to gig workers, estimated to be millions in number across India. Gig workers are people who earn from temporary or freelance arrangements outside of the traditional employer-employee relationship, working for the likes of Swiggy, Zomato and Ola.",Entrackr,"The gig economy has been thriving in India. Uber, Ola, Swiggy, Zomato, Rapido, Bounce, Vogo and many others engage over 5 million gig workers altogether. If we include all Internet-based businesses, then the figure may go up to 10 million or even beyond.Since the number of such workers is going to proliferate, the government has recognised them under draft Code on Social Security, 2019. According to a proposal draft made by labour and employment ministry, gig workers will have insurance (life and disability), health and maternity benefits, old-age protection and several other rights.The draft includes people working with marketplaces and any other form of digital intermediaries. It essentially means that people working with Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm without being on their payroll will also be entitled to the rights mentioned above.However, they won’t be entitled to benefits under the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’ State Insurance schemes.As per the draft law, gig workers are defined as people who participate in a work arrangement system and earn livelihood via activities outside the traditional relationship between employer and employees. The term can also be referred to as higher-skilled workers like coders or technology professionals working part-time or as freelancers.In the last few years, the number of these workers has grown. According to human resource consultancy firm Noble House report, close to 70% Indian companies hired gig workers once last year.While the number of gig workers has been going north, there has been no social security system to take care of them in the country.If and when the draft code turns into law, the government will further define the role of firms which hire them.Observers hailed the move but cautioned against overregulation. They raised concern around the implementation of the policy across digital businesses such as taxi aggregators, food apps, and workforce supplier platforms.Over regulations can burden such companies with extra cost, which will indirectly impact gig workers. Recently, the US had approved a similar law for gig workers, giving them wage benefits and protection.The development was first reported by Business Standard.",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/social-security-benefits-gig-workers/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
499,Tesla board must face trial over Musk's high pay package: Judge,"The board of electric vehicle maker Tesla must defend CEO Elon Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package at a trial, a US judge has ruled. A shareholder lawsuit had alleged the package unjustly enriched Musk. The pay deal includes no salary or cash bonuses for Musk, rather setting compensation based on Tesla's market value growing to $650 billion over the next decade.",Reuters,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) board of directors must defend at a trial Chief Executive Elon Musk’s multibillion dollar pay package, which a shareholder lawsuit said unjustly enriched the head of the electric vehicle company. Tesla estimated the 2018 compensation package was worth $2.6 billion when it received stockholder approval in March 2018, although stock analysts at the time said it could be worth up to $70 billion if the company - which has yet to post an annual profit - grew quickly. The compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire Musk, but sets rewards based on Tesla’s market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next decade. On Friday, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled against Tesla’s request to dismiss the lawsuit by shareholder Richard Tornetta at an initial phase in the litigation because of the way the board approved the package. As a result, the board must now defend against allegations that it breached its fiduciary duty in approving the package, and that the package unfairly enriches Tesla’s CEO. The ruling opens the way for additional discovery into the decision-making process. Tornetta had asked that the pay package be rescinded and the board of Tesla be overhauled to better protect investors. The ruling turned on Tesla’s compensation committee, which the company conceded was not independent of Musk, according to Slight’s opinion. Had the package been negotiated by truly independent directors and approved by a majority of shareholders who were unaffiliated with Musk, Slights said he would have dismissed the lawsuit.  “Plaintiff has well pled, however, that the board level review was not divorced from Musk’s influence,” Slights wrote. Musk’s compensation package passed shareholder approval with about 73 percent of votes cast, excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal. The vote result indicated some, but not all, big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company, which has struggled to produce its electric vehicles efficiently and profitably.  At the time, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the compensation, noting that if achieved Musk’s award would surpass anything previously granted to top U.S. executives. Under the award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla’s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder. The package does not require Tesla  to hit profitability metrics.  Musk does not hold a majority of the Tesla’s stock, but in a separate case, Slights determined that Musk’s sway over Tesla made him in effect a controller from a legal standpoint. As a controller, the board is subject to a higher standard of legal oversight for decisions it makes regarding its relationship with Musk. The judge did dismiss Tornetta’s claim that the package amounted to a waste of corporate assets.

509,Cap that gently shocks the scalp could reverse baldness: Study,"A University of Wisconsin-Madison research has found that a cap-like device that would send shocks to the scalp could help reverse baldness. This new hair-growth technology aims to stimulate skin with gentle, low-frequency electric pulses, which would coax dormant hair follicles to reactivate hair production. This could be used as an intervention for people in early stages of pattern baldness.",India.com,"There is good news for people experiencing hair loss as researchers have developed a wearable device that harnesses energy from the wearer and delivers gentle electric pulses to stimulate dormant hair follicles and regrow hair.Because the devices are powered by the movement of the wearer, they do not require a bulky battery pack or complicated electronics.In fact, they are so low-profile that they could be discreetly worn underneath the crown of an everyday baseball cap.“I think this will be a very practical solution to hair regeneration,” said one of the researchers Xudong Wang, Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.In side-by-side tests on hairless mice, the devices stimulated hair growth just as effectively as two different compounds found in baldness medicines, said the study published in the journal ACS Nano.Based on devices that gather energy from a body’s day-to-day motion, the hair growth technology stimulates the skin with gentle, low-frequency electric pulses, which coax dormant follicles to reactivate hair production.The devices do not cause hair follicles to sprout anew in smooth skin. Instead, they reactivate hair-producing structures that have gone dormant.That means they could be used as an intervention for people in the early stages of pattern baldness, but they would not bestow cascading tresses to someone who has been as bald as a billiard ball for several years.Explaining the hair-growth technology, the researchers said that small devices called nanogenerators passively gather energy from day-to-day movements and then transmit low-frequency pulses of electricity to the skin. That gentle electric stimulation causes dormant follicles to “wake up.”“Electric stimulations can help many different body functions,” Wang said.“But before our work, there was no really good solution for low-profile devices that provide gentle but effective stimulations,” Wang said.",https://www.india.com/lifestyle/grow-hair-on-bald-head-with-this-new-wearable-device-read-on-3779460/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The mice were injected with a virus to block ApoE.",ANI,"Washington D.C. [USA], Sept 20 (ANI): Researchers have found that a few proteins which are more prevalent in older people prevent the fractured bones from healing.Duke Scientists hope this discovery will lead to new treatments to help people heal after injuries or surgeries.""When we decreased the protein level, aging was reversed,"" said senior author Gurpreet Baht, Ph.D. and assistant professor in the Duke Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. ""Not only was there more bone and healing happened faster, but it was also structurally more sound.""Baht's team confirmed that older people have more Apolipoprotein E, ApoE for short, than younger people, reported the study published in JCI Insight.They wanted to figure out if and how ApoE affects the multi-step process of bone healing.When you break a bone, your body sends signals through the bloodstream to recruit cells to fix it.At last a different kind of cell eats up the cartilage scaffolds and osteoblasts fill those holes with bone.""Over time, this cartilage will continue to be resorbed and osteoblasts will continue to deposit new bone,"" Baht explained. ""After a few months of your arm or leg healing, there will be almost no cartilage anymore. And if you were to look at it five years out, there'd be no sign of an injury anymore.""That's if the bone healing process works perfectly. But the researchers found that if they added ApoE to a petri dish with skeletal stem cells, fewer cells developed into osteoblasts and the osteoblasts were worse at building bones.""We wanted to see if the cell population was more or less capable of becoming osteoblasts,"" Baht said. ""[Normally,] you put these cells down in a petri dish for about a month and the dish becomes so hard that you can't even scratch the surface because they've made two-dimensional bone there. ApoE-treated cells are still able to do this, they just don't do it as much or as well.""Next, the researchers created an intervention by injecting a virus which keeps mice from making Apolipoprotein E. Circulating ApoE levels dropped by 75 per cent and the healed bones contained one and a half-times more strong, hard bone tissue than bones of untreated mice.The research was supported by the Duke Centre for the Study of Aging and Human Development and Claude D.

While a lot of people are stressed with over speeding and not wearing helmets, Ola and Uber drivers in Delhi are stressed over carrying condoms. The cab drivers operating in the Delhi-NCR region have become cautious to ensure that a challan is not issued to them for not carrying condoms.

Similarly, if someone has a fracture, a condom can be tied around the area until he reaches a hospital. There are non-medical benefits of condoms as well. It can hold up to three litres of liquid.

There have been several conspiracy theories related to Area 51, most importantly those pertaining to the US government's cover-up of secrets related to UFOs and aliens.",Reuters,"RACHEL, Nev. (Reuters) - UFO enthusiasts drawn by alien-themed festivities poured into rural Nevada on Friday near the Area 51 U.S. military base, but fears of a mass raid on the remote site or a public safety crisis proved unfounded, with only five people arrested. More than 3,000 out-of-towners ventured on Thursday and Friday to the desert region around Area 51, a secretive U.S. Air Force installation long rumored to house government secrets about extraterrestrial life and spaceships. The pilgrimage and two festivals welcoming the visitors were organized after a Facebook user jokingly exhorted readers to “storm” Area 51 on Sept. 20 “to see them aliens.” The date chosen for the gathering was never explained.      Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said the region’s guests were largely well behaved, with just a few exceptions. “I don’t want to jinx myself, but so far it’s gone pretty well,” he said on Friday afternoon. Three people were arrested on suspicion of trespassing onto the grounds of Area 51, Lee said. Another was arrested for indecent exposure after urinating near an entrance to the base, and a fifth for an alcohol-related incident, Lee said. A steady stream of cars continued rolling into the county on Friday for events that were scheduled to run through the weekend. The arrests were reported after a group of about 150 UFO fans and curiosity-seekers gathered outside the heavily guarded entrance to Area 51 around 3 a.m. on Friday, the date and time set by the social-media invitation that went viral. One man wore an orange space suit and some sported tin foil hats and alien masks. A sign among the gathering read “Free E.T. from the government.” “A bunch of random people in weird costumes standing outside of a government base, why would you want to miss that?” said a YouTube personality who goes by the name Atozy. “That’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.” One young woman ducked under a protective gate and was momentarily detained by authorities and released. Most showed no interest in crossing the barrier, according to law enforcement officials keeping watch over the crowd. “They’re just here to see what’s going on,” said Sergeant Orlando Guerra of the Nevada Department of Public Safety Investigation Division. “They’re here to have fun.” The Air Force had issued a stern warning to the public not to trespass on the installation, which it said is used to test aircraft and train personnel. Area 51 had long been shrouded in mystery, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of its alien crew from a supposed unidentified flying object crash in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The U.S. government did not confirm the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes.  The documents, however, did not end suspicion about space aliens there. Area 51 sits about 12 miles (19 km) from the tiny town of Rachel, a community of about 50 year-round residents north of Las Vegas that hosted a music festival to entertain those traveling to the region.  Some residents had urged the public to stay away for fear the town would be overwhelmed with unruly tourists.   As of early Friday, about 3,000 people had pitched camp in town, most of them outside the Little A’Le’Inn, an alien-themed motel and restaurant that is Rachel’s only business. Another 250 attended a separate event 40 miles away in Hiko that featured musicians and ufologists. Ed Callahan, 49, who drove from Victorville, California, to Rachel, described the atmosphere as “just chill.”  “It’s not this big, wild thing,” said Callahan, who sported a cowboy hat covered in tin foil and silver tentacles. “When they said 40,000 people, I didn’t want it to be that. If a few more people show up, it’d be all right.” Connie West, the Little A’Le’Inn co-owner who scrambled over three months to mobilize for an influx of alien fans, said she was gratified that chaos failed to ensue. “I’m relieved the naysayers were proven wrong,” she said.

517,"China a threat to the world, building military rapidly: Trump","Expressing concern over China's growing military might, US President Donald Trump has said the country is a threat to the world. Blaming his predecessors for not stopping China from stealing US' intellectual property to strengthen its defence capabilities, Trump further said the two countries were very close to having a trade deal.",The Quint,"Expressing concern over China's growing military might, US President Donald Trump has said the Communist nation is a threat to the world and blamed his predecessors for not stopping it from stealing America's intellectual property to bolster its defence capabilities.China has hiked its military spending by seven per cent to USD 152 billion as Beijing aims at countering America's push into the disputed South China Sea.""Obviously China is a threat to the world in a sense because they are building a military faster than anybody and frankly they are using US money,"" Trump, who was accompanied by visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, told reporters here on Friday.Trump said the US Presidents before him allowed China to take out USD 500 billion a year and more than that.""They have allowed China to steal our intellectual property and property rights and I'm not doing that,"" he said.According to the president, the two countries were very close to having a trade deal.""We work very closely, had intellectual property, all of the tough things work negotiated and then at the last moment, they said we cannot agree to this,"" he alleged, referring to the abrupt collapse of the trade deal with China early this year.""I said that's all right we are charging you 25 per cent tariffs and then it's going up and it will continue to go up. Frankly we are making so many hundreds of the numbers that we are taking in to our treasury...Look at the great reports that came out two days ago on retailing, on consumers, on numbers that nobody believes,"" he added.The world's two largest economies are locked in a trade war since Trump in March last year imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 per cent on USD 250 billion of Chinese goods. In response, China, the world's second largest economy after the US, imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on USD 110 billion of American goods.The two countries have resumed their trade negotiations.Trump has said that he will enter into a trade deal with Beijing only if he is confident that it is good for the US.""We are taking hundreds of millions potentially over a short period of time, hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of money is coming in from China that never came in before so China wants to make a deal, I think we want to make a deal,"" Trump said.""We will see what happens, but I view China in many different ways, but right now I am thinking about trade. But you know trade equals military because if we allow China to take USD 500 billion out of the hide of the United States that money goes into military and other things,"" said the US president.Responding to a question from reporters, the visiting Australian prime minister appeared to have a different view on China.""We have a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. We work well with China. But as we've spoken many times, we need to ensure that as countries develop and realise their potential, they come onto a whole new level, and that means there can be special rules around that,"" Morrison said.""We have a great relationship with China. China's growth has been great for Australia, but we need to make sure that we all compete on the same playing field. This is something that the United States and Australia have been very consistent on, that we need to move into this new world where economies are changing,"" he said.""China is a big economy, not as big as the United States, but it's a big economy, and that means we've all got to get on the same page with how the rules work. That's what we're working to achieve,"" Morrison said.Trump said the US was making a lot of progress with China.""They're having a bad year. Worst year in 57 years. Their tariffs aren't coming into us. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs. They are devaluing their currency, which means the tariffs are not costing us probably anything, but certainly not very much. They're also adding a lot of money into their economy. They're pouring money into their economy, but were taking in many billions of dollars,"" he said.""At some point in the not-too-distant future, it'll be over USD 100 billion. We've never taken in 100 cents from China. It was always the other way around. With that, they lost over 3 million jobs there. Supply chain is crashing, and they have a lot of problems. And want to make a deal. So, we'll see what happens,"" Trump said.(This story was auto-published from a syndicated feed.

518,US signs deal to send asylum seekers to El Salvador,"The US signed a deal with El Salvador on Friday to help the Central American nation give refuge to more asylum seekers. Individuals arriving at the US-Mexico border through El Salvador should be able to seek protection there even if they intend to apply for asylum in the US, US' Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States and El Salvador on Friday agreed to attempt to reduce the flow of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border by strengthening El Salvador’s capacity to provide for asylum seekers, but did not detail any concrete actions. “The core of this is recognising El Salvador’s development of their own asylum system and committing to help them build that capacity,” Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told reporters in Washington after signing documents with El Salvador’s minister of foreign affairs, Alexandra Hill. “Individuals crossing through El Salvador should be able to seek protections” in the Central American country even if they were intending to apply for asylum in the United States, he added. Neither official said when the arrangement would take effect or provide details on how it would be administered. It was unclear how such a deal would work, given that most migrants from other countries take routes that avoid crossing the small, poverty-stricken El Salvador.         “We are going to work out operational details. This is just a broad agreement,” Hill told Reuters upon leaving the signing ceremony. The agreement represents the latest effort by McAleenan to seal immigration deals with the Northern Triangle countries of Central America - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - from where many immigrants arriving at the U.S. southern border set out. U.S. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a centrepiece of his administration and is pushing to staunch the flow of migrants - many of them families - crossing into the United States. Border crossings reached record highs earlier this year, frustrating Trump.  Guatemala has signed a so-called ‘safe third country’ deal with the United States that requires asylum seekers who travel through Guatemala on the way to the U.S.-Mexico border to ask for refuge in Guatemala first, instead of in the United States. The Guatemalan Congress, however, has not ratified the deal.  The United States has a similar safe third country agreement with Canada.    Honduras, meanwhile, held talks with the United States over migration this week that will continue into next, Honduras’ foreign ministry and the U.S. Embassy said in a joint statement on Friday.  Among the topics under discussion is the possibility of requiring Cuban migrants to seek asylum in Honduras rather than the United States. Citing fears that the United States could retaliate against Honduran exports, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told local television on Thursday that there was a need for a region-wide agreement with Mexico, Guatemala and the United States, given increasing numbers of migrants from Cuba and Africa traversing Central America to reach the United States. “So we believe that Honduras should also become a safe country to avoid the situation becoming more complicated,” Hernandez said.  Immigration advocates have criticized the deals, saying Central American countries where many people are fleeing from violence, poverty and endemic corruption, do not have the capacity to process more asylum claims and cannot assure safety for vulnerable migrants.  “The real goal of the United States is to make sure these (asylum) claims are never heard in a U.S. court,” said Douglas Rivlin, spokesman for Washington-based pro-immigration group America’s Voice, following the U.S.-El Salvador agreement. El Salvador, which has 6.6 million people, is one of the world’s most violent nations, largely due to criminal gangs involved in drug trafficking and extortion.  As the U.S. government has pursued the deals, the Department of Homeland Security in parallel issued a rule that would bar most migrants from gaining U.S. asylum if they had not sought safe haven in any country they first transited through.  The rule accomplishes virtually the same thing as the agreements, but it has faced legal challenges. A federal court initially blocked the rule from taking effect, but the Supreme Court on Sept. 11 allowed it to be implemented while the court challenges are ongoing.

The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party fears the debts to China could run as high as $3 billion. China provides what help it can to the Maldives with no political pre-conditions, Wang added.",Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Maldives are not “mired in a Chinese debt trap”, the Chinese government’s top diplomat told the visiting Maldivian foreign minister, amid fears in the Indian Ocean country of debts as high as $3 billion owing to Beijing. The Indian Ocean island chain has been caught in a battle for influence between India and China, which invested millions of dollars during the rule of the pro-China former leader Abdulla Yameen as part of China’s Belt and Road plan, designed to improve its global trade reach. The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party, which won a landslide in the archipelago’s parliamentary election in April, fears the debts to China could run as high as $3 billion and risk sinking the economy. Meeting Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid in Beijing, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi said China’s cooperation with the Maldives would not be affected by the change of government, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Friday. “China’s cooperation with the Maldives aims to promote the well-being of the Maldivian people, without political intentions and without seeking geopolitical interests,” the ministry cited Wang as saying.  China provides what help it can to the Maldives without attaching political preconditions, and does not interfere in the its internal affairs, Wang added. “It is totally without basis to say that ‘the Maldives is mired in a Chinese debt trap’,” he said. The Chinese statement quoted Shahid as saying no country in the world had been as generous to helping the Maldives, pointing to the building of infrastructure and “provision of a large amount of aid and loans”. “In this regard, there is absolutely no so-called ‘debt trap’. To say that is complete nonsense.” China has been stung by criticism, mostly from Western countries, that it loads up poor, developing nations with unsustainable debt they have no hope of paying back, and that it is seeking to use this to leverage political influence. China says its loans are much welcomed and much needed, and points out that it provides them with no political pre-conditions and gives funds to places that Western donors ignore.

The Friday episode of the show welcomed Ruma Devi, who is the president of the Gramin Vikas Evam Chetna Sansthan and has empowered over 22,000 women across 75 villages in Barmer making them financially independent. To support her on the quiz reality show, Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha graced the hot seat and tried helping Ruma Devi with several questions that were asked by Big B. While Ruma and Sonakshi together managed to win a total of Rs. 12 lakh 50 thousand, one specific question that the two were asked has grabbed everyone's attention.The question that was asked to Ruma Devi was, ""According to the Ramayana, Hanuman fetched the Sanjeevani herb for whom?"" While Ruma did not know the answer to the question, Sonakshi was confused thinking that Sita might be the correct answer. The two, however, decided to use a lifeline and it was the expert advisor who informed Sonakshi and Ruma that Lakshmana was the right answer. Soon after the two were informed about the right answer, Big B trolled the Dabangg actress for not knowing the answer since the names of almost all her family members have a connection to Ramayana. While her uncles and father go by the names Ram, Lakshmana, Bharat and Shatrughan Sinha, the actress' brothers are named Luv and Kush. Amitabh Bachchan also jokingly told Poonam Sinha that she shouldn't let her husband watch this episode.

But Pulwama attack changed the entire situation,” Pawar said, adding that he was witnessing similar anger against the Devendra Fadnavis government in the state. “Only another Pulwama attack-like situation can changepeople’s mind,” he said.Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, both ruled by the BJP, are due in October and November. The Election Commission is likely to announce the poll dates soon.Talking about prospects of an alliance of Opposition parties to take on the BJP-Shiv Sena combine, Sharad Pawar said Samajwadi Party and other smaller parties are already in support of the Congress-NCP alliance. He said the NCP was ready to join hands with Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), however, the Congress raised an objection to it.The 78-year-old leader also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ‘misuse’ of central agencies like the CBI and ED. During Modi government’s tenure people learnt about (existence of) agencies like ED and CBI. I have worked with many prime ministers, but such misuse (of agencies) wasnot seen earlier,” news agency PTI quoted Sharad Pawar, as saying.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

550,"Iran says new US sanctions target Iranians' access to food, medicine","Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday denounced renewed US sanctions against its central bank as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine. ""When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under maximum pressure has failed,"" he said.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will pursue any aggressor, even if it carries out a limited attack, and seek to destroy it, the head of the elite Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday, after attacks on Saudi oil sites which Riyadh and U.S officials blamed on Tehran.    “Be careful, a limited aggression will not remain limited. We will pursue any aggressor,” the head of the Guards, Major General Hossein Salami, said in remarks broadcast on state TV. “We are after punishment and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.”  U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia’s air and missile defences after the Sept. 14 attacks. Iran denies involvement in the attack, which was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran and currently fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen’s civil war. Trump’s move drew fire in Washington on Saturday from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it his “latest outrageous attempt” to circumvent Congress.  “These unacceptable actions are cause for alarm,” Pelosi said in a statement accusing Trump of turning “a blind eye” to Saudi violence against innocent Yemenis, human rights abuses and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “The United States cannot enable more brutality and bloodshed,” she added. “Congress will do our job to uphold the Constitution, defend our national security and protect the American people.”   Meanwhile, Amirali Hajizadeh, who heads the Revolutionary Guards’ aerospace branch, said any attacks on Iran would receive “a crushing response”, the official news agency IRNA reported. Hajizadeh was speaking at a public exposition called “Hunting Vultures”, where remains of drones which were downed in Iran or crashed there were displayed, along with the Iranian air defence system which shot down a U.S. military drone in June.  The exposition is part of annual events commemorating the start of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, which also includes air and naval displays in the Gulf and military parades on Sunday.        Iran’s foreign minister meanwhile denounced renewed U.S. sanctions against its central bank following the Saudi attacks as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine, and said the move was a sign of U.S. desperation. The United States on Friday imposed more sanctions, targeting the Central Bank of Iran, which was already under U.S. sanctions, the National Development Fund of Iran - the country’s sovereign wealth fund - and an Iranian company that U.S. officials say is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases. “This is a sign of U.S. desperation ... When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under ‘maximum pressure’ has failed,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in remarks shown on state television. “But this is dangerous and unacceptable as an attempt at blocking ... the Iranian people’s access to food and medicine,” Zarif said, speaking after arriving in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly next week. Separately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi rejected what he called “unreal and repetitious accusations by certain Saudi officials” about the attacks, state media said. A senior Saudi official said earlier that Riyadh would wait for the results of a probe before responding to the attacks on its oil facilities, for which it believes Iran is responsible.  Zarif said he would on Wednesday meet foreign ministers of the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was agreed with Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia as well as the United States.   “As we have said before, the United States can only attend if it returns to the (nuclear accord) ... and ends its economic war against Iran,” Zarif said. The United States withdrew from the accord last year and re-imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran. After reports on social media of a cyber-attack on some  petrochemical and other companies in Iran, a state body in charge of cyber security denied there had been a “successful” attack. “Based on our observations ... there has not been a successful cyber-attack on oil facilities and other critical infrastructure,” said an official statement carried by IRNA. NetBlocks, an organisation that monitors internet connectivity, earlier reported “intermittent disruptions” to some internet services in Iran starting on Friday evening.  The group said the impact was limited, affecting only specific providers, and the cause was unclear. “Data are consistent with a cyber-attack or unplanned technical incident on affected networks as opposed to a purposeful withdrawal or shutdown incident,” it said in a tweet.  NetBlocks Director Alp Toker said they saw four Iranian networks falling offline over a three hour period on Friday evening. This began when the first reports emerged and ended shortly afterwards. The networks have been stable since.

Aramco is shipping equipment from the US and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities.",Reuters,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has emerged from attacks on its oil facilities “stronger than ever”, Chief Executive Amin Nasser told employees in a message, adding that full oil production would resume by the end of this month. The Sept. 14 attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais plants, some of the kingdom’s biggest, caused raging fires and significant damage that halved the crude output of the world’s top oil exporter, by shutting down 5.7 million barrels per day of production. “The fires that were intended to destroy Saudi Aramco had an unintended consequence: they galvanized 70,000 of us around a mission to rebound quickly and confidently, and Saudi Aramco has come out of this incident stronger than ever,” Nasser said in the internal message, on the occasion of the Saudi national day, to be celebrated on Sept. 23. “Every second counts in moments like these, and had we not acted quickly to contain the fires and undertake rapid restoration efforts, the impact on the oil market and the global economy would have been far more devastating.” Six days after the assault, which hit at the heart of the Saudi energy industry and intensified a decades-long struggle with arch-rival Iran, the state oil giant Aramco invited reporters on Friday to observe the damage and the repair efforts. Thousands of employees and contractors have been pulled from other projects to work around the clock to bring production back. Aramco is shipping equipment from the United States and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities, Aramco officials told reporters. Aramco already brought back part of the lost production and will return to pre-attacks level end of September, Nasser said. “Not a single shipment to our international customers has been missed or cancelled as a result of the attacks, and we will continue to fulfil our mission of providing the energy the world needs,” he said in the message, seen by Reuters.     Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had used its reserves to maintain oil supply flows to customers abroad and inside the kingdom. Yemen’s Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran. Tehran, which support the Houthis, has denied any involvement in the attacks. Saudi Arabia says 18 drones and three missiles were fired at Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil processing facility, while the Khurais facility was hit by four missiles.  No casualties were reported at either site even though thousands of workers and contractors work and live in the area.

552,Taiwanese companies considering India as alternative to China,"Taiwanese firms are looking to invest in India's tech, renewable energy, auto and farm sectors, Taiwan External Trade Development Council's Vice Chairman Shih-Chung Liu said. Trade war encouraged Taiwanese firms with operations in China to look for newer markets, he added. About 120 Taiwanese information and communications technology firms are setting up operations in Bengaluru, an official said.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwan is pitching India as a potential business destination to its tech, auto, renewable energy and farm sector firms as the United States’ trade war with China has pushed its companies to look for newer markets, two officials said on Friday. More than 10,000 Taiwanese companies, including Apple suppliers Foxconn and Wistron have massive operations in China, thanks to its tax incentives, organised supply chain and logistics, efficient business parks as well its cultural ties to the island. But a trade war between Washington and Beijing has led to higher tariffs on goods worth tens of billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, prompting companies to look at other countries to escape higher tariffs. “This trade war has encouraged more Taiwanese companies to figure out other options. So India and also other ASEAN countries are the alternative markets,” Shih-Chung Liu, vice chairman of Taiwan External Trade Development Council, told reporters. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional block comprising ten nations in Southeast Asia, which promotes economic, political and military ties between members. Beijing maintains that Taiwan, an island 110 miles (177 km) off the Chinese mainland, does not qualify for formal diplomatic ties with any country. And though India has no formal relation with Taiwan, Taipei runs an Economic and Cultural Center in capital New Delhi, which operates as a de facto embassy. Taiwanese firms are looking to invest in India’s technology, renewable energy, electric vehicle and farm sectors, Liu said. “India is among the most important markets, among those 18 new southbound policy countries.”. Taiwan’s southbound policy focuses on strengthening ties in the areas of culture, tourism, education and trade with 18 southeast and south Asian countries. It has opened four trade offices in India in the last few years and bilateral trade with Asia’s third-biggest economy stood at $7 billion in 2018. Trade between India and Taiwan will likely touch $10 billion over the next few years, said Chung-Kwang Tien, the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre. Helping that trade are about 120 Taiwanese information and communications technology firms, which are setting up operations in India’s southern technology hub Bengaluru, Tien said. “These companies have already put in $100 million,” he added.

This comes weeks after Facebook was fined $5 billion by US FTC and a separate $100 million by US SEC over its privacy scandals.",TechCrunch,"Facebook  has suspended “tens of thousands” of apps connected to its platform which it suspects may be collecting large amounts of user profile data.That’s a sharp rise from the 400 apps flagged a year ago by the company’s investigation in the wake of Cambridge Analytica, a scandal that saw tens of millions of Facebook profiles scraped to help swing undecided voters in favor of the Trump campaign during the U.S. presidential election in 2016.Facebook did not provide a more specific number in its blog post but said the apps were built by 400 developers.Many of the apps had been banned for a number of reasons, like siphoning off Facebook user profile data or making data public without protecting their identities, or other violations of the company’s policies.Despite the bans, the social media giant said it has “not confirmed” other instances of misusing user data beyond those about which it has already notified the public. Among those previously disclosed include South Korean analytics firm Rankwave, accused of abusing the developer platform and refusing an audit; and myPersonality, a personality quiz that collected data on more than four million users.The action comes in the wake of the since-defunct Cambridge Analytica and other serious privacy and security breaches. Federal authorities and lawmakers have launched investigations and issued fines from everything from its Libra cryptocurrency project to how the company handles users’ privacy.Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, said this was not an “accident” as Facebook has claimed.“Facebook put up a neon sign that said ‘Free Private Data,’ and let app developers have their fill of Americans’ personal info,” he said. “The FTC needs to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible.”Facebook said its investigation will continue.Mark Zuckerberg is ‘proud’ of how Facebook handled its scandals this year",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/facebook-suspends-apps-hoarding-data/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

566,Sex abuse case against former Sequoia Capital Partner dismissed,"A 2016 sexual abuse case against venture capitalist Michael Goguen, which led to his exit as a Partner from Sequoia Capital after nearly 20 years, has been dismissed. The plaintiff, Amber Baptiste, sought $40 million as compensation for the alleged abuse and sexual infection contracted from Goguen. Baptiste failed to undergo medical examinations and produce necessary documents.",TechCrunch,"Three-and-a-half years ago, a lawsuit hit the San Mateo, Calif. county courthouse that briefly attracted the attention of the worldwide venture capital community, given its salacious nature. The defendant: longtime VC Michael Goguen, who’d spent 20 years with Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. The plaintiff: Amber Baptiste, a former intimate who described him through the filing as a “worse predator than the human traffickers.” She said in the filing that she would know, having become a “victim of human trafficking” at age 15 when she was “brought to America in 2001,” then “sold as a dancer to a strip club” in Texas, which is where she says she first encountered Goguen.What she wanted from the lawsuit was money that she said was owed to her by Goguen: $40 million over four installments that the lawsuit stated was for “compensation for the sexual abuse and [a sexual] infection she contracted from him.” According to her suit, Goguen agreed to these terms, paying Baptiste a first installment of $10 million before refusing to make further payments.At the time, Goguen called the allegations “horrific” and suggested Baptiste was a spurned lover, saying they’d had a “10+ year romantic relationship that ended badly.” He also filed a cross-complaint alleging extortion.Today, that cross-complaint lives on, but Baptiste’s case against Goguen was just dismissed by arbitrator Read Ambler, a retired judge who served 20 years with the Santa Clara County Superior Court and who wrote in a ruling filed yesterday in San Mateo that Baptiste’s failures to undergo medical examinations doomed her case, as did her failure to produce documents necessary in the discovery process.“The record presented further establishes that Baptiste’s’ failures were willful,” Ambler writes. “Baptiste appears to believe that the information responsive to the discovery at issue is either not relevant, or with respect to the medical examinations, not permitted by law. While Baptiste is free to believe what she wants to believe, the orders are binding on Baptiste, and her failure to comply with the orders is unacceptable.”Baptiste doesn’t currently have legal representation, though four sets of lawyers have represented her over time.Patricia Glaser, a high-powered attorney, originally took on Baptiste’s case (and later agreed to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein), but she asked to be relieved from the case five months later, citing “irreconcilable differences.” More recently, an LA-based couple that operates the Sherman Law Group filed a motion to be relieved as Baptiste’s counsel, citing “irreconcilable differences and a breakdown in communication.”Goguen’s attorneys say he will continue to pursue his counterclaims against Baptiste and looks forward to “complete vindication.”Though Ambler never remarked on the merits of Baptiste’s claims, Goguen’s attorney Diane Doolittle further said today in a statement that: “Amber Laurel Baptiste’s sensationalized lawsuit against Silicon Valley venture capitalist Michael Goguen  collapsed under the weight of its own falsehood yesterday, when a judge dismissed the case because of Baptiste’s repeated, egregious and willful misconduct. Over the course of this case, Baptiste perjured herself, concealed, destroyed and falsified key evidence, and demonstrated her contempt for the legal system by systematically violating numerous court orders.”Baptiste could not be reached for comment.Baptiste’s lawsuit against Goguen prompted Sequoia to part ways with him almost immediately. Later the very day that TechCrunch broke news of the suit in 2016, a Sequoia spokesman told us that while the firm understood “these allegations of serious improprieties” to be “unproven and unrelated to Sequoia” its management committee had nevertheless “decided that Mike’s departure was the appropriate course of action.”Goguen, who sold an $11 million home in Atherton, Calif., in 2017, has spent much of his time in recent years at another home in Whitefish, Mont., where he has seemingly been wooing locals.An August story about Goguen in The Missoulian about a separate case describes him as “known locally for philanthropic ventures.”The piece dutifully continues on to note that: “Such donations have funded Montana’s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and a Flathead group teaching girls to code. Two Bear Air, [Goguen’s] northwestern Montana search and rescue outfit free to anyone who has needed it, has performed well over 500 missions and 400 rescues, according to executive director and chief pilot Jim Pierce. Goguen has personally completed 30 rescues, the Daily Inter Lake reported in February.

Moreover, Justice Vineet Kothari, the senior-most judge of the Madras High Court, has been appointed as the acting Chief Justice of the court till further orders.",The News Minute,"Days after the Chief Justice of Madras High Court submitted her resignation after her controversial transfer to the Meghalaya High Court, President Ram Nath Kovind accepted her resignation on Friday. Justice Vineet Kothari, the senior-most judge of the Madras High Court, will be the acting Chief Justice of the Madras High Court till further orders.The Supreme Court collegium had, in the last week of August, recommended swapping the Chief Justices of two high courts in the country – the Madras High Court and the Meghalaya High Court. According to the decision of the collegium, Justice AK Mittal, the present Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court was to be posted as the Chief Justice of Madras High Court, while Justice VK Tahilramani was to take over AK Mittal’s post in Meghalaya.The decision had sent shockwaves within the fraternity. While it could have been construed as an advancement for Justice AK Mittal, since the Madras High Court is one of the oldest high courts in India and is the fourth largest one in the country in terms of number of judges, Justice VK Tahilramani was slated to head a court that was set up in 2013 with only three judges.Though Justice VK Tahilramani had requested the collegium to reconsider its decision, the collegium had refused to do so. Protesting the collegium’s decision, Justice Tahilramani submitted her resignation to the President of India and the Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi in the first week of September.Justice Tahilramani was sworn in as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court on August 12, 2018, after she was transferred from the Bombay High Court where she served as acting Chief Justice three times between 2015 and 2017. Justice Tahilramani had presided over many important and controversial cases during her term in the Bombay High Court. On May 4, 2017, she upheld the life imprisonment of 11 convicts in the gang rape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of her family during the 2002 Gujarat riots. She also set aside the acquittal of seven persons in the case including 5 police officers and 2 doctors, convicting them under sections 201 (tampering of evidence) and 218 (not performing duties) of the Indian Penal Code. ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/justice-tahilramani-s-resignation-accepted-vineet-kothari-act-cj-madras-hc-109252?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
573,US to deploy troops to Saudi after drone attacks on oil sites,"The US has announced plans to send forces to Saudi Arabia in the wake of attacks against the country's oil infrastructure. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said the deployment would be ""defensive in nature"". Total troop numbers have not yet been decided. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attacks, however, both the US and Saudi have blamed Iran.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia’s air and missile defenses after the  largest-ever attack on the kingdom’s oil facilities, which Washington has squarely blamed on Iran. The Pentagon said the deployment would involve a moderate number of troops - not numbering thousands - and would be primarily defensive in nature. It also detailed plans to expedite delivery of military equipment to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Reuters has previously reported that the Pentagon was considering sending anti-missile batteries, drones and more fighter jets. The United States is also considering keeping an aircraft carrier in the region indefinitely.  “In response to the kingdom’s request, the president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature and primarily focused on air and missile defense,” U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said at a news briefing. “We will also work to accelerate the delivery of military equipment to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to enhance their ability to defend themselves.” The Pentagon’s late Friday announcement appeared to close the door to any imminent decision to wage retaliatory strikes against Iran following the attack, which rattled global markets and exposed major gaps in Saudi Arabia’s air defenses.  Trump said earlier on Friday that he believed his military restraint so far showed “strength,” as he instead imposed another round of economic sanctions on Tehran.   “Because the easiest thing I could do, ‘Okay, go ahead.  Knock out 15 different major things in Iran.’ ... But I’m not looking to do that if I can,” Trump told reporters at the White House. But the deployment could further aggravate Iran, which has responded to previous U.S. troop deployments this year with apprehension. It denies responsibility for the attack on Saudi Arabia. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition that includes the UAE, has claimed responsibility for the strikes. Relations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated sharply since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports. For months, Iranian officials issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran were blocked from exporting oil, other countries would not be able to do so either. However, Iran has denied any role in a series of attacks in recent months, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and strikes claimed by the Houthis. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have  fingered southwest Iran as the staging ground for the attack, an assessment based at least in part on still-classified imagery showing Iran appearing to prepare an aerial strike.  They have dismissed Houthi claims that the attacks originated in Yemen. One of the officials told Reuters the strike may have been authorized by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.    The United States is wary of getting dragged into another conflict in the Middle East. It has troops positioned in Syria and Iraq, two countries where Iranian influence is strong and Iran-backed forces operate openly.  U.S. officials fear Iran’s proxies might attempt to strike American troops there, something that could easily trigger a broader regional conflict. Saudi Arabia has said it was attacked by a total of 25 drones and missiles, including Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and “Ya Ali” cruise missiles. U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said officials were still hammering out the best array of capabilities to defend Saudi Arabia, noting the difficulty combating a swarm of drones. “No single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like that, but a layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk of swarms of drones or other attacks that may come from Iran,” Dunford said.

575,Saudi reveals damage caused by drone attacks on oil facilities,"Saudi Arabia on Friday took media on a tour of the oil facilities damaged by the recent drone attacks and showed melted pipes and burnt equipment. At Abqaiq, the world's largest oil processing plant, reporters saw a punctured and blackened stabilizer tower. ""We are working 24/7...This is a beehive,"" an official of state oil giant Aramco said.",Reuters,"ABQAIQ, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Friday took media on a tour of oil facilities damaged by attacks that Washington and Riyadh blame on Iran, showing melted pipes and burnt equipment, as Tehran vowed wide retaliation if heightened tensions boil over into hostilities. The kingdom sees the Sept. 14 strikes on its Khurais and Abqaiq facilities — the worst attack on Gulf oil infrastructure since Iraq’s Saddam Hussein torched Kuwaiti oilfields in 1991 — as a test of global will to preserve international order. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the United States was imposing sanctions on Iran’s central bank over the attack. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the bank was Tehran’s last source of funds. Asked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility. Iran denies involvement in the attack, which initially halved oil output from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest petroleum exporter. Responsibility was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen’s four-year-old conflict. At Abqaiq, one of the world’s largest oil processing plants, reporters saw a punctured, blackened stabilizer tower that Khalid Buraik, Saudi Aramco vice-president for southern area oil operations, said would have to be replaced. As reporters examined a shattered separator dome draped with a red tape labeled “Danger”, Buraik said 15 towers and facilities had been hit at Abqaiq, but it would regain full output capacity by the end of September. At Khurais oilfield to the west, which the Saudi defense ministry says was hit by four missiles, Reuters reporters were shown repair work under way, with cranes erected around two burnt-out stabilization columns, which form part of oil-gas separation units, and melted pipes.  “We are confident we are going back to the full production we were at before the attack (on Khurais) by the end of September,” Fahad Abdulkarim, Aramco’s general manager for the southern area oil operation, told reporters. “We are working 24/7...This is a beehive.”  Workmen wearing red high visibility jackets and white helmets moved through the site, a large compound the size of several football stadiums containing interconnected structures of piping and towers. A mound of blackened debris lay on the ground. An executive said the scorched mess once covered much of the surface of the facility but now only a small mound is left.  Some workers sprayed what appeared to be water on the ground. Mobile cranes and water trucks stood near the crumpled, mangled remains of a fire-damaged stabilization tower.  The Sept. 14 attacks intensified a years-long struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a sometimes violent contest for influence in several flashpoints around the Middle East. Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Thursday the attacks were an “extension of the Iranian regime’s hostile and outlawed behavior”. Iran has warned the United States against being dragged into a war in the Middle East and said it would meet any offensive action with a crushing response. Tehran amplified that message on Friday when a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said Iran would respond from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean against any U.S. plots. “If the Americans think of any plots, the Iranian nation will respond from the Mediterranean, to the Red Sea and to the Indian Ocean,” said General Yahya Rahim-Safavi, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, state news agency IRNA reported. Lebanon’s Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement warned Saudi Arabia against betting on a war against Iran “because they will destroy you,” its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said. “Your house is made of glass and your economy is made of glass. Like the glass cities in the UAE,” he said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had called the attacks an “act of war” but on Thursday he said Trump, who has ordered more sanctions on Iran, wants a peaceful solution to the crisis.  Iran’s foreign minister on Friday questioned Pompeo’s remarks and listed repeated Iranian diplomatic initiatives. “Coalition for Peaceful Resolution?,” Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter, and listed eight diplomatic initiatives by Iran since 1985, including a peace plan for Yemen in 2015. He later said Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates seemed to wish to “fight Iran to the last American”. Oil prices were on track for their biggest weekly jump since January, lifted by rising Middle East tensions after the attack. Brent crude was up more than 7% from last Friday’s close at $64.69 a barrel, U.S. West Texas Intermediate was $58.47. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Saudi King Salman in a phone call that China condemned the attack and called on all parties to avoid escalating the situation, Xinhua reported. Despite being a relatively low-profile diplomatic player in the Middle East, China has close economic and energy relations with both Saudi Arabia and Iran. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said groundless accusations against Iran over the attacks were inflaming tensions, Interfax news agency reported.

A Bengaluru-based chef, who visited Hampi, has been sent to judicial custody in connection with the incident. The incident came to light after officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) noticed Nagaraj, a 45-year-old resident of Yelahanka in Bengaluru, near the pillars. While Nagaraj maintains that he accidentally toppled the pillars while taking a selfie, officials informed security personnel who immediately nabbed Nagaraj and turned him over to the police. He was charged under sections of the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958, the Times of India reported.According to police, Nagaraj admitted that he had caused the pillars to topple. “Since it had been raining for the last few days, the ground holding the historical pillars on the protected heritage site got loose. When the accused pushed one of the pillars, it collapsed onto another pillar, which also fell to the ground. Though it was unintentional, we have booked a case after the ASI lodged a complaint. We have to respect the heritage monuments and the law in force to protect them,” CK Baba, Superintendent of Police, Ballari, told The Hindu. This comes seven months after four men were arrested for vandalising stone pillars at a temple in Hampi.

I think India should be looking ahead,"" he said.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - The time has come for India’s long-serving wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni to bow out of international cricket - and he should go before he’s pushed, batting great Sunil Gavaskar said. Former captain Dhoni has been the subject of intense speculation among fans, ex-players and pundits over when he will retire from international cricket since India’s semi-final exit from the World Cup. The veteran of 350 one-dayers, who quit playing tests at the end of 2014, has not provided any hint of what his plans are.  However he made himself unavailable for India’s tour of the West Indies and instead opted to spend 15 days with India’s territorial army, a reservist force that draws on civilians who can do short stints to assist the military. Dhoni was also a notable omission from India’s Twenty20 squad for the ongoing three-match series against South Africa. “Nobody knows what’s in MSD’s mind. Only he can clarify what he thinks his future with Indian cricket is,” former India captain and opening batsman Gavaskar told India Today.  “But he’s now 38, by the time the next T20 World Cup comes he will be over 39 years old. I think India should be looking ahead.” Dhoni captained India to the World Twenty20 crown in 2007, and the 50-over World Cup title at home four years later, and enjoys cult status in the cricket-mad country. At his prime Dhoni was widely considered the best “finisher” in the game but his electrifying ability to put bowlers to the sword to the end of innings has waned of late, while he has also struggled to make solid starts. Dhoni’s glovework, however, still remains top class. The next 50-over World Cup is still four years away but the World Twenty20 will be held in 2020 and Dhoni enjoys unwavering support from India captain Virat Kohli who has publicly backed him on numerous occasions. “His value to the side is always going to be fantastic. It’s not just the runs he will score or the catches and the stumpings he will effect,” said Gavaskar, who once held the record for most test runs and centuries in the longest format of the game.  “His overall presence is so calming on the field, it’s fantastic for the captain because the captain gets the benefit of his views. So that’s a huge plus. “But I think the time has come. Everybody has a shelf life,” he added. “He should be going without being pushed out.

He further called it the ""lowest moment"" in his cricketing career.",CricTracker,"Gautam Gambhir retired from all forms of cricket back in December 2018 after representing Delhi in one of the matches in the Ranji Trophy at the Feroz Shah Kotla. Albeit he wasn’t a regular member of the national team in the last few years, he would still be remembered as someone, who played two match-winning knocks in the final of the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 World Cup.However, the retirement could’ve come way back in 2007. The southpaw made his ODI debut back in 2003, but couldn’t make the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. The Delhi-born was around 25 years old at that time and the rejection got to him, so much so that he wished to bid adieu to the sport.Advertisement“In 2007, when I missed the 50-over World Cup, that was the lowest moment in my cricketing career. I had given up on cricket. Before that, I had missed both U-14 and U-19 World Cups. In 2007 I thought I was the closest to play the World Cup, but when they did not include me in the squad, I had given up on cricket,” Gambhir was quoted as saying in India Today.Just when Gambhir felt down and out, he was in for a surprise. The left-hander was picked in the Indian squad for the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa. He didn’t make a great start and got out for a duck to Mohammad Asif in the first match against Pakistan at the Kingsmead in Durban.But the rub of the green went his way and he ended the tournament as the leading run-scorer. India defeated Pakistan in the final at the Wanderers in Johannesburg and Gambhir churned out a masterful 75 off 54, though he didn’t get the Man of the Match.“Then I was chosen in Twenty-20 World Cup in 2007 and I got dismissed for a duck in the first match against Pakistan. But as fate has it, I finished as the leading run-scorer in the World Cup and we ended up winning the tournament so one should never give up,” the veteran added.From thereon, Gambhir didn’t look back and made a name for himself in all three formats. With 20 centuries and 63 half-centuries, Gautam was one of the most reliable batters at the top of the order. He was once also the ICC’s number one Test batsman back in 2009.",https://www.crictracker.com/had-given-up-on-cricket-gautam-gambhir-after-2007-world-cup-snub/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Saturday that the sanctions against the Iran's Central Bank are “nothing new, but same old bans in different form”. He called on the US to “accept that the policy of sanctions is a failed one.”The US government has imposed a wide range of sanctions since it abandoned the nuclear pact it had signed in 2015, along with Iran and several other world powers.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section",https://www.rt.com/business/469251-trump-sanctions-iranian-bank/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

598,YouTube updates criteria for channel verification,"YouTube has announced changes to its eligibility criteria for channel verification starting late October. Unlike the present criteria of channels with over 1,00,000 subscribers receiving verification, YouTube will verify them based on their ""authenticity"" and ""prominence"". It also announced a ""new look"" for the verified symbol, swapping the checkmark with a grey-coloured swipe across channel name.",TechCrunch,"YouTube’s  verification program is getting a massive overhaul, the company announced today, which will likely result in a number of less prominent creators losing their verification status. Previously, YouTube allowed any channel that reached 100,000 subscribers to request verification. That limit is being removed, with a change to the verification program that rolls out in October. Going forward, YouTube will focus its efforts on verifying channels that have more of a need to prove their authenticity — like those belonging to a brand, public figure, artist or another creator who might be subject to impersonation, for example.YouTube says the earlier verification system was established when the site was smaller, but its ecosystem has since grown and “become more complex.”Instead of looking at a number of subscribers — a metric than can be gamed by bots — the new system will have more murky requirements. YouTube says it’s about “prominence,” which it defines in a number of ways.For starters, YouTube will determine if the channel represents a “well-known or highly searched for creator, artist, public figure or company.” It will also consider if the channel is widely recognized outside of YouTube and has a strong online presence, or if it’s a channel that has a very similar name to many other channels.We understand YouTube will use a combination of human curation and algorithmic signals to make these determinations. When asked, the company declined to discuss the specifics, however.There were several reasons YouTube wanted to change its system, beyond raising the threshold for verification.The company had run into a similar problem that Twitter once faced — people mistook the verification badge as an endorsement. On Twitter, that issue reached a tipping point when it was discovered that Twitter had verified the Charlottesville rally organizer. Twitter stopped verifying accounts shortly afterward. Its system today is still being fixed, but the project has been put on the back burner.Similarly, YouTube’s research found that over 30% of users misunderstood the verification badge’s meaning, believing the checkmark indicted “endorsement of content,” not “identity.”This is problematic for YouTube for a number of reasons, but mainly because the company wants to distance itself from the content on its platform — content that is often racist, vile, false, dangerous, conspiracy-filled and extremist. YouTube wants to be an open site, with all the troubles that entails, but doesn’t want to be held accountable for the terrible things posted there — like the 14-year-old girl who grew to online fame by posting racist, anti-Muslim, anti-LGBTQ videos, or the high-profile star who made repeated racist comments, then gets honored by YouTube with special creator rewards. There were other issues with the prior system, as well.Some creators would fake their verification status, for instance. Before the changes, a verified channel would display a checkmark next to its channel name. This could be easily forged by simply adding a checkmark to the end of a channel name.Plus, the checkmark itself only really worked when people viewed the channel’s main watch page on desktop or mobile. It didn’t translate as well to interactions in live chats, on community posts or in stories.By revamping the verification system, YouTube is clarifying that the verification isn’t an endorsement — it’s a neutral statement of fact. It’s also less difficult to forge, and works everywhere the creator interacts with fans.The updated verification system drops the checkmark in favor of a gray swipe across the channel name (see above).This applies to both channels and artists. With regards to the latter, it will replace the music note.The system will roll out in late October, YouTube said, and the new criteria will apply for all channels.Those who meet the new requirements won’t need to apply — they’ll automatically receive the new verified treatment. Others who didn’t qualify for re-verification will be notified today and will have the option to appeal the decision before the changes take place.Information on the appeals process will be available in YouTube’s Help Center.Update, 9/19/19, 1:26 PM ET: Here’s the letter YouTube creators are receiving. Note it refers to a timeframe of “early” instead of “late” October for the changes.Here’s the email if you stay verified (thanks @thiojoe) –This is the one you get if you stay verified pic.twitter.com/uBpiIGdAE1— ThioJoe (@thiojoe) September 19, 2019",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/youtube-overhauls-its-problematic-verification-program/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Patients share their prescription with Digi-Prex through WhatsApp and the startup’s workers then deliver the medication to them on a recurring cycle.Delivery is not the only thing Digi-Prex is trying to provide. It helps patients better track when they need a new supply of medicine, and checks if they are seeing improvements. The startup has amassed thousands of customers in Hyderabad, Samarth Sindhi, founder of Digi-Prex, told TechCrunch in an interview.Digi-Prex just closed its seed round from a range of highly-influential VC firms. It’s also one of the largest seed financing rounds for an Indian startup.The startup has raised $5.5 million from Khosla Ventures,  Vedanta Capital, Y Combinator, Quiet Capital, and SV Angel. Justin Mateen,  a founder of Tinder, also participated in the round, said Sindhi.“Instead of trying to acquire customers online, we work with physicians and pharmacies to serve customers,” said Sindhi, an alum of Brown University who worked with a healthcare firm in the U.S. before returning to India. The startup shares some margin with physicians and pharmacies, but more importantly, it says this arrangement works for everyone because it is able to serve customers who are living at distant neighborhoods.Digi-Prex works directly with medicine distributors to secure supplies at lower costs. It then undercuts the pricing of over-the-top counters, providing medicines to its customers at discounted rates.Sindhi said the startup will use the fresh capital to expand its business to 10 cities in India, and find ways to be more useful to the patients. Some of the things that Digi-Prex is working on includes providing patients with access to better physicians and offering them more information about their disease.It’s not surprising why Digi-Prex is using WhatsApp as a distribution platform. “When I returned to India, I was fascinated by how nobody was texting anymore. Everyone was doing everything on WhatsApp,” he said.WhatsApp, which is already the most popular app in India, is increasingly finding business applications in the country.

The global climate strike is being led by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Students from several schools joined protests throughout the day in Mumbai, with thousands of events having been planned in more than 130 countries.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Millions of young people flooded the streets of cities around the world on Friday to demand political leaders take urgent steps to stop climate change, uniting in a worldwide protest inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Alarmed by images of the Greenland ice sheets melting and the Amazon rain forests burning, students and workers abandoned schools, shops and offices in nearly every corner of the globe, aiming to stop what they see as a looming environmental catastrophe. The protests started in the Pacific islands, where rising sea levels threaten a way of life, and followed the sun across Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and on to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. The coordinated student “strike” culminated in New York’s Wall Street, where some investors have embraced the fossil fuel industry. Massive crowds overwhelmed the streets of lower Manhattan, chanting “Save our planet!” while anticipating an address by Thunberg, an international figure who sailed across the Atlantic in an emissions-free yacht ahead of next week’s climate summit at the United Nations. “Right now we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action, then we will,” Thunberg told tens of thousands of people gathered at a park with a view of the Statue of Liberty. Once she took the stage, the crowd chanted her name, then went silent to hang on her every word. As she paused between sentences, people erupted into applause. “If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you. Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not,” she concluded. Demonstrators in Paris raised a painting of Thunberg as the Virgin Mary, a halo around her head reading, “Our house is on fire.”    “She’s like the icon of our generation,” New York protester Fiamma Cochrane, 17, said, highlighting the leadership role of young people in the international movement to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. Four million people participated worldwide including 300,000 in New York, organizers with the anti-fossil fuels group 350.org said. Reuters could not verify the crowd sizes. Concern has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the international Paris Accord on climate change and took a series of steps to dismantle environmental protections, including moving on Thursday to block stricter vehicle emissions standards in California. Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are among the world’s only national leaders who publicly question the science of climate change, and they are not taking part in next week’s U.N. climate summit. Thousands gathered across Brazil to take aim at Bolsonaro, who they say is allowing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest to clear space for soy beans and cattle ranching. In August, fires there surged to their greatest level since 2010.  “The policy of the Bolsonaro government is the policy of environmental destruction and deepening the climate crisis ... this is why we’re on strike,” said Marcela Pimentel Miranda, an organizer for Youth for Climate’s affiliate in Brasilia. One protester in Sao Paulo held up a picture of Bolsonaro and Trump beneath the hand-written “Abolish fossil fools!”  Demonstrators in Thailand stormed the environment ministry and feigned death, while activists in Berlin and Munich stood on  melting blocks of ice with nooses around their necks to symbolize the earth’s fate when the polar ice caps melt.     Protesters in Warsaw staged a performance of people drowning in a sea of plastic waste. “The planet is getting hotter than my imaginary boyfriend,” read a poster held by a teenager in Thailand. “Make love, not CO2” signs were spotted in Berlin and Vienna. While Europeans filled the streets, students in the Solomon Islands gathered at the rising ocean water’s edge wearing traditional grass skirts. The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels. Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, according to scientists. “There is no Planet B,” read a sign hoisted by a young woman in London. In Kenya, around 500 activists marched to demand that the government cancel plans for a coal plant and investigate corruption in hydropower dams. “In Samburu there is a lot of heat, the grass has dried up, there is little water,” said Francis Lentel, a young herdsman in traditional beads, holding a picture of the Earth weeping. The protest movement is putting increasing pressure on governments and companies to respond.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a new climate protection package thrashed out by parties in her coalition during all-night talks. Private industry has also responded. Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos on Thursday pledged to make the largest U.S. e-commerce company net carbon neutral by 2040. Hundreds of workers from Google, Amazon and other technology companies on Friday criticized their industry for being slow to tackle climate change and joined marches in San Francisco and Seattle calling for action.

615,China lured it with planes: Taiwan as Kiribati switches ties to China,Taiwan has said that China offered airplanes and ferries to lure the Pacific island nation of Kiribati after it severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in order to establish relations with China. Kiribati's decision came only four days after the Solomon Islands cut ties with Taiwan in favour of China. Only 15 countries now have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.,Reuters,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - China offered airplanes and ferries to lure the Pacific island nation of Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations, Taiwan said on Friday, as the self-ruled island lost a second ally to Chinese pressure in less than a week. The switch, just days after the Solomon Islands cut ties, deals a fresh blow to President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January, as it takes to seven the tally of allies lost to China since she took office in 2016. Taiwan has terminated diplomatic ties with Kiribati and will immediately shut its embassy there, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters. “According to information obtained by Taiwan, the Chinese government has already promised to provide full funds for the procurement of several airplanes and commercial ferries, thus luring Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations,” he added. China was trying to “suppress and reduce Taiwan’s international presence” and “ultimately destroy Taiwan’s sovereignty,” Wu said. “It is blatantly obvious that the Chinese government, by creating these diplomatic incidents, seeks to manipulate public opinion in Taiwan, influence Taiwan’s upcoming presidential and legislative elections, and undermine its democratic processes.” The Kiribati president’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China “highly appreciated” Kiribati’s decision to re-establish ties with Beijing, severed in 2003 when Tarawa recognised Taipei. Asked how much money China was offering Kiribati, Geng said principles and trust could not be bought but added that Kiribati would have “unprecedented development opportunities” with China by its side. China claims Taiwan as its territory, and says the democratic island has no right to formal ties with any country. Friday’s switch leaves Taiwan with formal relations to just 15 countries.  “They have chosen to give up a sincere friend and become a chess piece for China. We think it’s a huge mistake,” Tsai told reporters, warning of more “Chinese intimidation” ahead of the vote in January.  “They have one single goal - to reverse the presidential campaign. They are trying to tell Taiwanese that we can’t buy jets, we can’t support Hong Kong and that we can only elect a president who bows to pressure from China.” Since Tsai took office, China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan, by flying regular bomber patrols around the island, for example. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan’s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Aid requested by Kiribati from Beijing includes loans and a Boeing 737 aircraft, said a senior official in Taiwan with direct knowledge of the matter who sought anonymity. Citing intelligence gathered by Taipei, the source said China aimed to peel away more of Taiwan’s allies before the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1. “That worries several countries in the region, including the United States and Australia,” said the official, citing fears over China’s growing influence in the Pacific.  Kiribati is the seventh country to drop Taiwan as a diplomatic ally since 2016, following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, El Salvador and the Solomon Islands. Taiwan’s main opposition, the China-friendly Kuomintang party, urged Tsai’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to review its policy towards Beijing.  “The DPP should examine the real cause behind the breaking of ties and propose a practical solution,” it said in a statement. “It should not continue to shift the responsibility to the former ally, the mainland authorities or the opposition party.”   A spokesman for Taiwan’s presidential office said, “With the breaking of ties, China is forcing Taiwan to accept ‘one country two systems,’” referring to an arrangement that guarantees certain freedoms to the Chinese-ruled city of Hong Kong.    “The more Taiwan shows that it’s not being intimidated, the more it frustrates China’s scheme,” added the spokesman, Yun-kung Ting.

620,"People want to see batsmen in T20s, bowlers spoil party: Shamsi","South African spinner Tabraiz Shamsi has said that he feels T20 is a batsman's game and bowlers are just there to ""spoil the party"". ""People obviously are coming there to see batsmen hit fours and sixes. They're not there to see you bowl a maiden over,"" he added. He further said people's expectations from batsmen put more pressure on them.",Cricket Country,"South Africa’s left-arm wristspinner Tabraiz Shamsi feels that T20 is a batsman’s game in which bowlers like him “spoil the party”. Shamsi, 29, returned figures of 1/19 in three overs during the second T20I in Mohali and is now looking forward to drawing the series level at the Chinnaswamy Stadium which used to be his “home ground” until a couple of seasons back, when he used to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore.ALSO READ: Tabraiz Shamsi signs with Hampshire for final four Blast games“I feel it puts all the more pressure on the batsman to go out there and do what people want to see. So as bowlers, we are just there to spoil the party and make sure that we execute our plans well,” Shamsi, who has played 17 ODIs and 15 T20 Internationals for the Proteas, told PTI in an interview.“Chinnaswamy is a small stadium and I mean it’s a T20 series, so people obviously are coming there to see batsmen hit fours and sixes. They are not there to see you bowl a maiden over and that’s what it’s all about,” he said.Shamsi’s stint at RCB has helped him grow as a cricketer with the likes of Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle offering him useful tips.“Definitely, it helps when you are around speaking to world-class players like Virat, Gayle and Shane Watson. The world of cricket is shrinking in the sense that everyone is ready to share knowledge,” he said. “You will find senior South African fast bowlers imparting knowledge to Indian fast bowlers and vice-versa. Being familiar with surroundings while playing for RCB will certainly help.”Over the years, South Africa had Imran Tahir at their disposal but with the legspinner not around, Shamsi has a golden opportunity to lay a strong case for himself and cement a place as his team’s premier wristspinner.“I don’t see this as an additional responsibility. When Immy was there in the team, my job was to do what’s best for the team and obviously with him not being there, I am the only wrist spinner in the team. But I have not shied away from challenges and India is another one of those,” he said.“Being a legspinner myself, I know guys tend to help each other out as it’s a small club and we know how tough our art is. I found spending a lot of time with Tahir but I have found all the leg-spinners in the other teams easy-going.”In terms of idols, Shamsi draws inspiration from Australia chinaman bowler Brad Hogg.“Hogg, I used to watch his bowling a lot during my growing up years. He was the only left-arm wrist spinner playing the game then. But if you see knowledge is everywhere and you just have to be open-minded and to be able to pick things that works for you and leave things that don’t work for you,” Shamsi said.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/bowlers-like-me-spoil-the-party-for-batsmen-in-t20s-tabraiz-shamsi-893587?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
621,Twitter tests 'Hide Replies' feature in US and Japan,"Twitter has announced it is testing the 'Hide Replies' feature in the US and Japan, after initially testing the same in Canada. The feature lets a Twitter user hide any reply to their tweet, which they deem irrelevant, abusive or offensive. Hidden replies can be seen by the users who choose to click on a dedicated icon to view them.",TechCrunch,"Twitter’s  controversial “Hide Replies” feature, aimed at civilizing conversations on its platform, is launching today in the U.S. and Japan after earlier tests in Canada. The addition is one of the more radical changes to Twitter to date. It puts people back in control of a conversation they’ve started by giving them the ability to hide those contributions they think are unworthy.These replies, which may range from the irrelevant to the outright offensive, aren’t actually deleted from Twitter. They’re just put behind an extra click.That means people who come into a conversation to cause drama, make inappropriate remarks or bully and abuse others won’t have their voices heard by the majority of the conversation’s participants. Only those who choose to view the hidden replies will see those posts.Other social media platforms don’t give so much power to commenters to disrupt conversations. On Facebook and Instagram, for example, you can delete any replies to your own posts.But Twitter has a different vibe. It’s meant to be a public town square, where everyone has a right to speak (within reason.)Unfortunately, Twitter’s open nature also led to bullying and abuse. Before today, the only options Twitter offered were to mute, block and report users. Blocking and muting, however, only impact your own Twitter experience. You may no longer see posts from those users, but others still could. Reporting a tweet is also a complicated process that takes time. It’s not an immediate solution for a conversation rapidly spinning out of control.While “Hide Replies” will help address these problems, it ships with challenges of its own, too. It could be used as a way to silence dissenting opinions, including those expressed thoughtfully, or even fact-checked clarifications.Twitter believes the feature will ultimately encourage people to better behave when posting to its platform.“We already see people trying to keep their conversations healthy by using block, mute, and report, but these tools don’t always address the issue. Block and mute only change the experience of the blocker, and report only works for the content that violates our policies,” explained Twitter’s PM of Health Michelle Yasmeen Haq earlier this year.Since launching in Canada in July, Twitter said that people mostly used the feature to hide replies they found were irrelevant, abusive or unintelligible. User feedback was positive, as well, as those who used the tool said they found it was a helpful way to control what they saw, similar to keyword muting.In a survey, 27% of those who had their tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future, Twitter said. That’s not a large majority, but it’s enough to make a dent. However, it’s unclear how representative this survey was. Twitter declined to say how many people used the feature or how many were surveyed about its impacts.The system will now also ask users who hide replies if they also want to block the account, as a means of clarifying that “hiding” is a different function.“These are positive and heartening results: the feature helped people have better conversations, and was a useful tool against replies that deterred from the person’s original intent,” explained Twitter in a blog post, shared today. “We’re interested to see if these trends continue, and if new ones emerge, as we expand our test to Japan and the U.S. People in these markets use Twitter in many unique ways, and we’re excited to see how they might use this new tool,” the post read.Despite the expansion, Twitter says “Hide Replies” is still considered a test as the company is continuing to evaluate the system, and it’s not available to Twitter’s global user base.The new feature will start rolling out at 2 PM PT in both the U.S. and Japan and will be available across mobile and web clients.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/twitter-launches-its-controversial-hide-replies-feature-in-the-u-s-and-japan/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

637,US sanctions-hit Huawei launches phone without Google apps,"Chinese smartphone maker Huawei has launched its latest high-end smartphone without American technology giant Google's apps pre-installed on it. This comes over the US' move to put Huawei under its 'Entity List', restricting it from carrying out any business with US firms. ""Today because of the US ban we can't pre-install Google's applications,"" Huawei's consumer business group head said.",Times Now,"Chinese tech giant Huawei launched its latest high-end smartphone in Munich on Thursday, the first of its mobile devices not to carry popular Google apps because of US sanctions.""Today because of the US ban we cannot pre-install"" Google's applications, said Richard Yu, who heads Huawei's consumer business group, as he unveiled the group's latest Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro models.But heading off fears that a phone without popular apps like Whatsapp, YouTube or Google Maps could not succeed, he stressed that the equivalent platform by the Chinese giant offered a choice of 45,000 apps through the Huawei App Gallery.Yu added that the Chinese giant was investing US$1 billion (900,000 euros) into its Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) core software ecosystem, as he urged app developers to bring their creations to the system.Huawei, targeted directly by the United States as part of a broader trade conflict with Beijing, was added to a ""blacklist"" in Washington in May.Since then, it has been illegal for American firms to do business with the Chinese firm, suspected of espionage by President Donald Trump and his administration.As a result, the new Mate will run on a freely available version of Android, the world's most-used phone operating system that is owned by the search engine heavyweight.While Mate 30 owners will experience little difference in the use of the operating system, the lack of Google's Play Store -- which provides access to hundreds of thousands of third-party apps and games as well as films, books and music -- could be unsettling.Household-name services like WhatsApp, Instagram and Google Maps will be unavailable.The tech press reports that this yawning gap in functionality has left some sellers reluctant to stock the new phones, fearing a wave of rapid-fire returns from dissatisfied customers.With the trade conflict with the US unlikely to be resolved imminently, Huawei has little choice but to ramp up the development of its own ""ecosystem"" of devices, apps and services that would bind-users more closely to it.The world's second-largest smartphone maker after Samsung, Huawei earlier this month presented its proprietary operating system HarmonyOS, a potential replacement for Android.The Mate 30 will not yet have HarmonyOS installed.But it could make for a new round in the decades-old ""OS wars"" between Microsoft's Windows and Apple's Mac OS, then Android versus Apple's iOS.Meanwhile, Eric Xu, current holder of Huawei's rotating chief executive chair, has urged Europe to foster an alternative to Google and Apple.That could provide an opening for Huawei to build up Europe's market of 500 million well-off consumers as a stronghold against American rivals.""If Europe had its own ecosystem for smart devices, Huawei would use it... that would resolve the problem of European digital dependency"" on the United States, Xu told German business daily Handelsblatt.He added that his company would be prepared to invest in developing such joint European-Chinese projects.",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/huawei-launches-first-sanctions-hit-phone-without-google-apps/491899?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
638,Elon Musk-backed startup Stripe to get $250 mn at $35 bn valuation,"US digital payments startup Stripe is raising $250 million in funding at a pre-money valuation of $35 billion, a 56% surge from its previous valuation. The round saw participation from investors including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst. Founded in 2010, Stripe is backed by investors including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Google's venture arm CapitalG, among others.",TechCrunch,"After a week of launching new services to bring payments giant Stripe into the areas of lending and credit, the company is announcing another big step forward to fuel its growth: it’s raising another $250 million in funding at a pre-money valuation of $35 billion, money to fuel more international expansion, launching more products and targeting larger enterprise-sized businesses.This is a huge jump in valuation for the company: Stripe  was valued at $22.5 billion earlier this year when it raised $100 million.The startup said that General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia are all in the round already. We’ve also heard that SoftBank had been considering an investment. “It was a big miss when SoftBank didn’t invest two years ago,” one source close to the VC said to TechCrunch. But we’ve confirmed also with John Collison — the president of Stripe who co-founded the company with his brother Patrick (who is the CEO) — that SoftBank is not in this round.Nor will there be any corporate strategics involved in this round. Of note, Collison today confirmed that the bank providing the financial backing for its new cash advance and corporate card services is Celtic Bank, based in Salt Lake City. But the bank is not taking a strategic investment in the company as part of that deal.Although the round is not yet closed, Collison said the $250 million size is unlikely to change. The round should close in the next several weeks, he added.Stripe has long been reluctant to talk about when it might consider going public, and this round will put that prospect off even further. “We are still very happy as a private company,” Collison said today. “Our emphasis remans on the long-term opportunities.”Stripe spent the first several years of its life slowly building up its payments business — which primarily consisted of providing an API to e-commerce businesses so that they could easily integrate a payments option in their apps or websites. But in more recent years, it’s started to accelerate its growth with a significantly larger range of financial services — notably, now it describes its business as a “Global Payments and Treasury Network.” The latest products — cash advances and credit cards — are coming on the heels of other services that include incorporation services, fraud protection and and more. All this means not only that the company can diversify its own revenues, but it can differentiate itself from (or, in some cases, offer the same services as) its competitors. Others offering similar services to Stripe’s include PayPal and Adyen on the payments front, but as it adds more services, it’s also opening new competitive fronts with other rivals, now including Square, Brex and Clearbanc.While the U.S. remains Stripe’s main market, especially for new launches, it’s getting increasingly global. The company last week expanded its payments out to eight more countries and that is set to expand again to total 40 in the coming months. The company says it processes “hundreds of billions of dollars a year for millions of businesses worldwide,” although it declines to give specific numbers. Wayfair, Airbnb, Twilio, GitHub and The RealReal are among the kind of “enterprise” customers that it hopes to target more. Indeed, as startups in e-commerce grow into huge businesses, they are turning from being the kinds of small companies that Stripe used to target into the big companies that it now wants to target.“This comes in the context of the fact that we feel strongly about Stripe’s role in the growing internet economy,” Collison said. As we have pointed out before, the internet economy, for all its seeming ubiquity, is still a small part of all commerce, which is one reason brick and mortar is likely to be another target for Stripe in the long run, building on the point-of-sale services it already provides — even as the company continues to reap the rewards of its traction in the digital universe.“Even now, in 2019, less than eight percent of commerce happens online,” said John Collison, president and co-founder of Stripe, in a statement announcing the round. “We’re investing now to build the infrastructure that’ll power internet commerce in 2030 and beyond. If we get it right, we can help the internet fulfill its potential as an engine for global economic progress.”Updated with comments from John Collison, the co-founder of Stripe",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/stripe-is-raising-another-250m-at-a-35b-pre-money-valuation/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Sometimes cut-throat competition and aspiration for scale also force entrepreneurs to compromise with ethics. The Indian startup ecosystem has witnessed the ugly fight between several direct competitors, including OYO-Zo Rooms and Meru-Uber.OYO had levelled data theft allegation on Zo Rooms and dragged the Tiger Global-backed firm in the court. Making similar allegations, Meesho has slapped legal notices to nine ex-employees for joining its competitor GlowRoad.The notices alleged that ex-employees had stolen confidential data and GlowRoad had actively poached these employees to utilise the data to their benefit. The Facebook-funded company also initiated a case against GlowRoad and nine of its ex-employees in Bangalore civil court. In a blogpost, Meesho claims that GlowRoad has been engaged in unlawful and unethical business practices, methodically poaching employees and accessing the data that was generated by the company.

He further questioned the timing of the legal notices, as they are served after six months or a year employees left the company.Just because we are doing better than them in growth aspects, they are resorting to harassing our employees, added Sahu. In a Linkedin post, he said that Meesho legal notices to its employees are against freedom of choice.“We will strongly reply to these frivolous legal notices sent to some of our employees by Meesho so that this case can be set as a landmark example for any company that tries to take freedom of employees away, “he said.Both Glowroad and Meesho compete in the social commerce space.In the last two years, GlowRoad has raised $24.3 million. The company claims to have more than 6 million resellers currently. Whereas Meesho has raised more than $200 million and claims to have over 10 million resellers on its platform.",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/meesho-slaps-notices-to-ex-employees-glowroad/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
640,UN urged by own staff to look at its carbon footprint,"More than 1,000 United Nations employees have called on the global body to reduce its carbon footprint. ""Let us look at our own impact and take bold steps to address the climate emergency,"" the letter by the employees said. The UN emitted 1.86 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017, according to its own data.",Reuters,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Close to 2,000 United Nations employees have called for the global body to reduce its carbon footprint, including through curbs on their own diplomatic perks like business-class flights and travel handouts, a letter obtained by Reuters showed. The United Nations calls climate change the “defining issue of our time” and is hosting a New York summit on it next week. But reformers within say in the letter addressed to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that it needs more radical change to get its own house in order. “Our commitments need to be more ambitious and at least as concrete as those of the UN Member States and non-party stakeholders attending the UN Climate Action Summit,” said the letter, signed by at least 1,950 employees. It was organized by a group called Young UN, an internal network committed to ensuring the organization embodies the principles it stands for. “As Greta Thunberg just sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and young people across the world continue to strike every Friday, let us look at our own impact and take bold steps to address the climate emergency,” the letter said, referring to the Swedish teenager who has inspired global climate strikes. The United Nations emitted 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018, according to its own data which includes both the 44,000 secretariat staff present in more than 60 countries as well as tens of thousands of interns, contractors and peacekeeping troops deployed worldwide.  That equates to a carbon footprint larger than several of its member states, including Malta and Liberia, according to statistics from the Global Carbon Atlas for 2017. Among 10 issues identified by Young UN are travel allowances, which the letter said needed to be cut or scrapped “in order to disincentivize travel by UN employees and UN meeting participants motivated by financial gain”. Allowances, or per diems as they are known internally, are intended to cover travel costs including food and accommodation, and can exceed $400 a day for some locations such as New York, according to the International Civil Service Commission website. The letter also suggested that staff should be rewarded for downgrading from business class, where a spacious seat generates several times the emissions of an economy class ticket.  Travel accounts for nearly half the United Nations’ emissions, its data show. Last year, under pressure from member states, the head of the U.N. Environment Programme, Erik Solheim, stepped down amid criticism of his travels. Other reforms recommended in the letter include a complete divestment of the more than $60 billion U.N. pension fund from fossil fuels and creating offices run entirely on renewable energy. Young UN did not respond to requests for comment. Guterres is seeking to combat climate change from within in order to boost sustainability. “The Secretary-General welcomes the initiative of Young UN on climate action in the UN system,” Guterres’ office said in a statement to Reuters on Friday. “The Secretary-General is committed to lead by example and calls for transformative action to address the climate crisis, including on the part of the UN system and Secretariat itself,” it continued. The employees’ letter welcomed Guterres’ internal strategy but said it “misses the urgency of the crisis we are facing”.  The United Nations has also launched a “Greening the Blue” initiative which measures the U.N. system’s greenhouse gas emissions, waste disposal, fresh-water use, and environmental management. According to its latest report issued on Friday, 55 of its entities, or 95 percent, including the Secretariat, were climate neutral in 2018, against just over a third the previous year. But the letter raises doubts about U.N. offset mechanisms, a method that works through purchases of U.N.-certified carbon credits from approved green projects and is widely used by organizations and businesses to tout their green credentials.  This echoes criticism from NGOs about the contribution of offsets to sustainable development. Isabella Marras, Sustainable UN Coordinator, whose team produces the Greening the Blue report and was a signatory to the letter, said she saw scope for the United Nations to give even greater attention to environmental considerations. “What we are missing is the aggressive integration of environmental issues into our programs like the UN has done for women,” she told Reuters. But she stressed some of the pragmatic challenges in regions where environmental standards are less strong than in Western countries. Marie-Claire Graf, a 23-year-old Swiss climate activist visiting the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva, said the number of U.N. vehicles in vast carparks overlooking the lake and mountains was surprising. “The UN is doing some amazing things on environment but I am shocked by so many SUVs and the amount of travel,” said Graf, who was selected along with 100 young climate leaders to attend the U.N. Youth Climate Summit on 21 September. “The UN needs to lead on this transformation.” Additional reporting by Maggie Fick in Nairobi; Editing by Stephanie Nebehay, Catherine Evans and Mark Potter",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-un-document/u-n-urged-by-own-staff-to-look-at-its-climate-footprint-idUSKBN1W50YH?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

648,"Condom sales in Argentina fall amid recession, falling currency","Condom sales in recession-hit Argentina have fallen by 25% over recent months amid rising inflation and currency devaluation. Because of a weaker currency, condom prices have risen 36% since the start of the year as raw materials are imported, a manufacturer said. The peso currency has lost over 65% of its value against the dollar since the start of 2018.",Reuters,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In South America’s capital of romance, Argentine lovers are cutting back on one important cost: contraception. Amid a biting recession, a sharp currency devaluation and painful inflation, sales of condoms and birth control pills have tumbled, pharmacists and manufacturers say. “The devaluation of the peso is killing me,” actor and comic Guillermo Aquino jests in one viral video, in which a young man apologizes to a potential partner, saying he has only one condom left until the end of the year. “I love you, it’s not you, it’s the socio-economic situation,” adds the humorist. Underneath the comedy is a bleaker reality. South American’s No. 2 economy is expected to shrink 2.6% this year and is grappling with 50%-plus annual inflation. The peso currency has lost two thirds of its value against the dollar since the start of 2018, hammering imports and consumption. Domestic sales of cars, wines and meat have dipped as wallets have been squeezed. Industry sources estimated condom sales are down 8% since the start of the year compared to 2018, and have fallen by a quarter over recent months as the economic crisis has worsened. Most condoms, or the materials needed to make them, are imported, so a weaker currency has an immediate impact on the price, up some 36% since the start of the year, said Felipe Kopelowicz, president of Kopelco, manufacturer of Tulipán and Gentleman condom brands. Sales of birth control pill sales are also down - 6% for the year and by a fifth more recently, pharmacists said. Isabel Reinoso, president of the Argentina Pharmaceutical Confederation, told Reuters price rises meant thousands of women were going off the pill. “It’s around 144,000 women who have stopped taking contraceptives each month,” she said. Public health experts said the issue could aggravate levels of sexually transmitted disease. “When you’re just thinking about getting by day to day, health is often relegated and sexual health, which is still taboo and has little support, even more so,” said Mar Lucas, program director at Fundación Huésped, an Argentine non-profit organization fighting HIV. The government does distribute free condoms in public hospitals, but few know about it, she said. “We know they are rarely used, misused and used inconsistently. And so we keep having a lot of sexually transmitted infections,” added Lucas. Argentina’s Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Emiliano Di Ilio, a pharmacist working in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, told Reuters that steep inflation had caused sales of condoms and contraceptive pills in his pharmacy to fall by 20% and 25% respectively in the last two months. “People come, ask the price, and then just leave,” he said.

653,Pharmacy startup Generico raises $14 million led by Lightbox,"Mumbai-based pharmacy retail startup Generico has raised $14 million in a Series A funding round led by venture capital firm Lightbox Ventures. The startup's existing investors Tomorrow Capital and Whiteboard Capital also participated in the round. Founded in 2017 by IIT alumni Siddharth Gadia and Girish Agarwal, Generico runs an offline pharmacy retail chain focussed on generic medicines.",YourStory,"When IIT Bombay batchmates and friends Siddharth Gadia and Girish Agarwal delved deeper into the unorganised pharma segment for their second startup idea, the duo discovered a problem - generics.While significantly cheaper medicines with the same effects and composition were abundantly available, the end consumer wasn't getting the required benefits. This led to the birth of Generico. The duo opened their first store in Mulund, Mumbai in 2017. At present, it has over 41 stores. Siddharth Gadia and Girish AgarwalBut this wasn't their first rodeo. In 2015, Siddharth and Girish had launched Workcell, a B2B pharma platform that solved the retail issues plaguing the pharma industry on the B2B side. It acted as a discovery platform connecting pharmas to distributors.The startup helped reduce the bounce rate of prescriptions, turning out to be quite a hit and by 2016, the duo had onboarded over 20,000 pharma companies. After graduating from IIT in 2009, Girish joined P&G. In 2011, he was bitten by the startup bug and founded GVS, a project management consulting firm for medium scale firm.On the other hand, Siddharth was working in the metal refining space when he, too, realised that entrepreneurship was what he wanted to do. He founded Triptainment, a cloud tech platform that let people watch travel content without the internet. Soon, he also realised that it was a limited market. Eventually, the two decided to team up and started to brainstorm.Thus came Workcell in 2015 followed by Generics in 2017. Girish explains that the two felt the need to shift their focus from B2B to B2C was because healthcare, as a segment, has the maximum impact on the end consumer.“And that is where our focus needs to be,” he adds.The duo chose the offline pharma route because they felt that pureplay tech wasn’t the answer. “The people who use most of the medicines for chronic illnesses aren’t mobile or tech first,” says Siddharth. The startup has built a network of retail outlets to create awareness and build the needed trust.“We focussed on small store setups and began with three stores with a strong operating model,” Siddharth says. The stores, he adds, were in non-prime locations as the biggest challenge in going offline is managing rentals. But, there is some amount of tech, especially in reducing manual intervention. Generico has integrated with distributors and suppliers to make the ordering process simple. The team claims to be doing close to 200,000 transactions a month, and says it has made gross sales of over Rs 100 crore in two and a half years. Siddharth explains there is a significant push of branded generic medicines, which are primarily marketed by doctors. Hence, generics are largely neglected. He explains the market for traded generics is four to five percent of the $19 billion branded generic medicine. This, in turn, causes a large gap. Medicines take up a large chunk of all healthcare expenses and this was a space the co-founders believed needed strong attention. The startup raised Series A funding of $14 million led by Lightbox Ventures, Whiteboard Capital, an angel investor, and Tomorrow Capital. The team plans to use the funds towards expanding its retail footprint from 41 to 150 stores, enter more cites, build capabilities on the supply chain, technology, and data front.Generico is also building a disease management solution for chronic patients.On why Lightbox decided to invest in this pharma startup, Sandeep Murthy, Managing Partner at Lightbox Ventures, says,Sandeep adds that Generico has been able to establish trust with its customers by knowing medicines and sourcing the right ones at the right time.

The smartphones will arrive as successors to OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro which were launched at the beginning of this year. Ahead of the launch, OnePlus has already confirmed that it is making 90Hz display standard on its flagships this year. The company showed the design which confirmed that it will have a circular rear camera module. Apart from design and display, OnePlus is also planning big changes to charging capabilities.OnePlus has now announced that its next flagship smartphones will come equipped with Warp Charge 3T. It will apparently charge the devices at 23 percent faster speeds. “We believe that Warp Charge 30T offers the best charging solution for real-world usage. You can charge the phone at 23% faster speeds, even while using the device,” OnePlus CEO Pete Lau told TechRadar. The existing OnePlus 7 supports 20W fast charge while OnePlus 7 Pro supports 30W Warp Charge.OnePlus 7T official renders confirm triple rear camera setup with circular camera bump“We’re not going to introduce something for the sake of being first,” Lau said about new fast charging feature. “We took time to refine and iterate, continuously testing until we were able to achieve something we were proud to provide to our fans.”OnePlus has also confirmed that users will be able to use the same 30W Warp Charge charging brick with their new phone. Lau also revealed that Warp Charge 30 handles the power management inside of the power brick instead of inside the phone. This allows the phone to remain cool even when the device is charging at a faster rate and even when it is in use. “Our latest Warp Charge delivers 6A at 5V to attain 30W,” Lau told TechRadar.Even Apple has added fast charging to new iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max.

We have also arrested three people over extortion threats to Swami Chinmayanand.”The DGP also stated that charges of rape have also been added to the complaint against the BJP leader (see video above at 1:17).However, after local reporters questioned this, The Quint was able to confirm that no charges of rape have actually been added by the SIT.The Quint accessed a report of the SIT which shows that, in addition to the original offences of kidnapping and criminal intimidation alleged by the survivor’s father, the SIT has added offences under Section 376C and Section 354D of the IPC.Supreme Court advocate Vrinda Grover strongly criticised this move by the SIT, saying that this was a “very clear dilution of the offences and a weakening of the case.”Section 376C of the IPC deals with sexual intercourse by a position in authority, which does not amount to rape. It is punishable with rigorous imprisonment of five to ten years.According to Grover, the correct provisions of law that were attracted in this case were under Section 376(2) of the IPC, which deals with ‘aggravated rape’, and is punishable with at least ten years’ life imprisonment, if not life imprisonment. Specifically, she said the complaint disclosed offences under sub-clausesGrover was of the view that the failure to add Section 376(2) to the FIR showed that there “is a very, very clear dilution of the offences and a weakening of the case.” She pointed out that this provision is more serious as“has a corresponding section in the Indian Evidence Act. These aggravated rapes are circumstances where the rape is committed in a situation where the woman is in a coercive circumstance. And therefore, you cannot plead consent. The presumption shifts to the accused if the woman says that she did not consent and that sexual intercourse is proved.”She therefore believes this constitutes a “clear effort to shield the accused”.The Quint tried to contact DGP OP Singh for a response, but he was unavailable for comment.Pooja Singh, the lawyer representing Chinmayanand told ANI that the BJP leader was arrested from his residence, when his health was critical. He was under the observation of doctors when the police arrived, she added, saying that she was not allowed to meet him.He has been taken for medical examination to a government hospital, she said.Singh said the SIT took signatures of Chinmayanand's relatives on the arrest memo but no arrest-related documents, including a copy of the FIR, were given to them.As Chinmayanand was taken to the hospital for medical check-up, patients had to face a tough time as they were not allowed to enter the premises, according to PTI.Teams led by senior police officials have been deployed at the court premises and the hospital. A team of police officials is also patrolling the area to ensure there is no disturbance, a senior official said.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said the government took action against Chinmayanand only after the woman, who accused him of rape, threatened self-immolation.Taking to Twitter, she said it was the strength of the public and journalism that Chinmayanand had to be arrested.""The BJP government is so thick skinned that it did not take action till the rape survivor said that she will self immolate herself. This is the strength of the public and of journalism that the SIT had to arrest Chinmayanand,"" she said.""The public has ensured that 'Beti Bachao' does not remain in mere slogans but becomes a reality on the ground,"" she added.The 23-year-old woman, a student at a law college that Chinmayanand runs, has alleged that Chinmayanand sexually exploited her for a year after helping her with admission into his college.Inspector General Naveen Arora, who heads the SIT, said a mobile phone and a pen drive given by the student have been sent for forensic examination.The pen drive contains 43 video clips which the student says support her allegations, PTI reported.Police has registered a case of criminal intimidation and abduction against Chinmayanand on a complaint lodged by the woman's father. Later, the student also accused him of rape and ""physical exploitation"".Also Read : Chinmayanand Examined by Doctors After Complaining of UneasinessChinmayanand, who was admitted to the medical college in Shahjahanpur on Wednesday, was referred to King George's Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow.But he chose to return to his residence on Thursday and get ayurvedic treatment there, according to his counsel Om Singh.He underwent several tests at the Shahjahanpur hospital where a team of four doctors monitored his condition, a spokesperson told PTI.The student had earlier threatened self-immolation if the police do not arrest him.(With inputs from PTI, ANI, NDTV and The Hindu)(The Quint will no longer be on WhatsApp, owing to changes in its policies regarding news publishers.

674,Indonesians oppose law criminalising consensual sex outside marriage,"Indonesians have signed a petition opposing a law that criminalises consensual sex outside marriage. A maximum one-year prison term can be applied to a person who has sex with someone who is not their spouse. There would also be a maximum four-year prison term for women who have an abortion, applicable if there is no medical emergency or rape involved.",Reuters,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is poised to pass a new penal code that criminalizes consensual sex outside marriage and introduces stiff penalties for insulting the president’s dignity - a move rights groups  criticized as an intrusive assault on basic freedoms. Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim majority country and has substantial Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities, but has seen a recent trend towards deeper religious piety and conservative Islamic activism. The new criminal code is due to be adopted in the next week after parliament and the government agreed a final draft on Wednesday, four parliamentarians told Reuters. Lawmakers told Reuters that the new penal code, which would replace a Dutch colonial-era set of laws, was a long overdue expression of Indonesian independence and religiosity.     “The state must protect citizens from behavior that is contrary to the supreme precepts of God,” said Nasir Djamil, a politician from the Prosperous Justice Party. He said leaders of all religions had been consulted on the changes given that Indonesia’s founding ideology was based on belief in God.  Under the proposed laws, unmarried couples who “live together as a husband and wife” could be jailed for six months or face a maximum fine of 10 million rupiah ($710), which is three months’ salary for many Indonesians.  A prosecution can proceed if a village chief, who heads the lowest tier of government, files a complaint with police, and parents or children of the accused do not object. Parents, children and spouses can also lodge a complaint. The inclusion of the new power for village chiefs was warranted because “the victim of adultery is also society”, another lawmaker, Teuku Taufiqulhadi, said. The Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, an NGO, said millions of Indonesians could be ensnared by the new laws. It noted a study indicating that 40 per cent of Indonesian adolescents engaged in pre-marital sexual activity. “Across the board, this is a ratcheting up of conservatism. It’s extremely regressive,” said Tim Lindsey, director of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Indonesian Law, Islam and Society. A maximum one-year prison term also can be applied to a person who has sex with someone who is not their spouse and a close family member lodges a complaint. The law also impacts homosexuals as gay marriage is not recognized in Indonesia. The code also establishes prison terms for those found to commit “obscene acts”, defined as violating norms of decency and politeness through “lust or sexuality”, whether by heterosexuals or gay people. The new laws will also apply to foreigners. However, asked whether tourists in Indonesia could face jail for extramarital sex, Taufiqulhadi said: “No problem, as long as people don’t know.” There would also be a maximum four-year prison term for women who have an abortion, applicable if there was no medical emergency or rape involved. The code further introduces fines for some people who promote contraception, and a six-month prison term for unauthorized discussion of “tools of abortion”. In addition, local authorities would get greater freedom to introduce punishments for breaches of customary laws not covered in the penal code. There are more than 400 local regulations that activists say impinge civil rights, such as the mandatory wearing of a hijab, an Islamic headscarf for women. Meanwhile, parliament has reintroduced the offence of “attacking the honor or dignity” of Indonesia’s president and vice president. A similar law was struck down by the Constitutional Court in 2006, and the new version is likely to be challenged by rights activists as well. Insulting the government and state institutions also carries a prison term.

She had also spoken about the abuses suffered by Pakistani women, including forced marriages and honour killings. Ismail is accused of ""anti-state activities"" and ""inciting violence"".",ANI,"Washington DC [USA], Sept 20 (ANI): Gulalai Ismail, the Pakistani rights activist who has been accused of treason by Islamabad, has revealed that she has escaped to the US via Sri Lanka.In an interview with Afghan journalist Bashir Ahmad Gwakh of Mashaal Radio, Ismail said she was hiding in Pakistan for nearly six months and said she travelled to Sri Lanka with the help of her friends before leaving for the US.Ismail took the baton to highlight incidents of sexual abuse by Pakistani security forces. Following her crusade against the atrocities committed on country's women, she was slapped with treason charges.The 32-year old rights activist managed to slip through the dragnet last month and is now staying with her sister in Brooklyn in New York. She has also applied for political asylum in the US.Even though she has been able to escape to America, she is still worried about her parents and people who helped her during the days of hiding.""Pakistan thinks that the US Department of State will force me to leave the US along with my family. But, I will continue my struggle in the US,"" Ismail told Mashaal Radio.In a country like Pakistan, where criticism of the military is frowned upon, Ismail campaigned vigorously for women's rights, bringing attention to rapes, disappearances and other abuses that she and many others say have been committed by the country's security forces.Ismail became a fugitive in May in her country, soon after she posted accusations on social media against Pakistani soldiers. In her posts on Facebook and Twitter, she had accused soldiers of raping and sexually abusing Pakistani women on her Facebook and Twitter pages in January this year.The woman right activist also took part in the ethnic Pashtun movement. The movement headed by Manzoor Pashteen has now become another headache for the Pakistani Army, whose heavy-handed techniques to crush the movement has failed miserably.""There are misconceptions about Pashtuns in America that needs to be fixed. From there, I will be fighting and the world will know that Pashtuns are the victims of war,"" said Ismail.Human rights defenders believe that the charges of treason against her were false and that she was being targeted for pointing out the blatant abuses committed by the Pakistani military.Ismail has been barred by the Pakistani government from leaving the country.In November last year, Pakistan-based media outlet Dawn reported that the Islamabad High Court was informed that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had recommended putting Ismail's name on the Exit Control List (ECL) for her alleged anti-state activities abroad.However, the court had ordered the removal of her name from the list following a petition by Ismail challenging the government's decision to put her name on the ECL. But, the court allowed the interior ministry to take appropriate action, including confiscation of her passport, in the light of recommendations made by ISI.

The vacation rental company today took the rare step of announcing in a press release that it plans to go public next year, in 2020. The startup, which first launched in 2008, has grown to become a $30 billion company, with more listings than the eight largest hotel groups in the world, combined.The company yesterday published an optimistic update on its future. ""As our community has grown, our business has thrived. In the second quarter of 2019, Airbnb recognized substantially more than $1 billion in revenue. The second quarter of 2019 marked the second quarter in our history in which Airbnb revenue exceeded $1 billion.""The initial plan was for Airbnb to go public as soon as this year, along with Uber and Lyft.

That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019,"" said Blecharczyk in an interview with Business Insider.As a publicly traded company, Airbnb still may have an uncertain trajectory ahead. Lower than expected market debuts for Lyft and Uber may lower the confidence of investors. WeWork, another Silicon Valley startup that aimed to go public this year, postponed plans after being unable to secure enough funding.But unlike other startups, Airbnb has turned a profit. The company said revenue topped $1 billion in the second quarter of 2019, the second time it has done so. It also acquired both HotelTonight and travel company Urbandoor this year.

Meanwhile, Arsenal defeated Eintracht 3-0 in their Europa League opener.",Reuters,"MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Seventeen-year-old striker Mason Greenwood scored his first senior Manchester United goal and saved his side’s blushes in a 1-0 win over Kazakhstan’s Astana in their Europa League Group L opener at Old Trafford on Thursday. The prodigy slotted home through the keeper’s legs at the near post in the 73rd minute to make history in only his second start as the first player born in the 2000s to score a senior goal for the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s youthful line-up had earlier struggled to dominate their weakest opponents in the group despite having plenty of possession. United made nine changes to the side that started against Leicester City in the Premier League last weekend, with Nemanja Matic taking the captain’s role in the absence of Ashley Young and goalkeeper David De Gea. They came close to scoring after three minutes when Fred’s powerful long-distance strike from smacked off the top of the crossbar. Marcus Rashford missed another great chance 10 minutes later with a close-range shot straight at the goalkeeper. “We made it hard for ourselves,” said Solskjaer, relieved at least to be leading Group L after Partizan Belgrade and AZ Alkmaar drew 2-2 in Serbia. “It’s pleasing, though, that we got three points, got off to a decent start. “In and around the box he (Greenwood) is one of the best finishers we’ve got and I’m happy he got his goal. I’m sure he’ll go home tonight and be happy with that one.” While he partnered 21-year-old regular Rashford up front, teenagers Angel Gomes and Tahith Chong made their full debuts before being replaced by Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard respectively. Lingard hit the post in the 80th minute and Diogo Dalot missed a sitter in front of 50,000 fans as United raised the tempo after going ahead but still looked short of creativity. “It was a hard game. First half we tried to open the game and to score a fast goal but they had a solid defence,” Matic told BT Sport. “It’s good for the (young players) to have the opportunity to play these games. They have to use that, to work hard to get more chances.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond",https://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-europa-mun-ast-report/greenwood-grabs-first-goal-for-man-united-in-1-0-win-over-astana-idINKBN1W42YM?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Ben Ali came to power in 1987 after overthrowing then-President Habib Bourguiba in a coup. He took over as head of military security in 1964 and as head of national security in 1977.",Reuters,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia’s Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, whose overthrow in a 2011 uprising triggered the “Arab Spring” revolutions, died in exile in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, days after a free presidential vote in his homeland.  His funeral will take place on Friday in Saudi Arabia, his family lawyer, Mounir Ben Salha, told Reuters. “It is the end of dictators like him. We cannot forget that he destroyed our country ... he gave orders to kill civilians in protests in 2011,” said Imad Layouni, an unemployed 26-year-old in a Tunis coffee shop.  Ben Ali fled Tunisia in January 2011 as his compatriots - many of them angered after a vegetable seller set himself on fire a few weeks earlier in protest at the police - rose up against his oppressive rule in a revolution that inspired other uprisings in the Middle East and led to a democratic transition at home.  On Sunday, they voted in an election that featured candidates from across the political spectrum, sending two political outsiders through to a second round vote unthinkable during Ben Ali’s two decades in power. However, while Tunisians have enjoyed a much smoother march to democracy than citizens of the other Arab states that also rose up in 2011, many of them are economically worse off than they were under Ben Ali.  While almost all the candidates in Sunday’s election were vocal champions of the revolution, one of them, Abir Moussi, campaigned as a supporter of Ben Ali’s ousted government, receiving 4% of the votes.  “It is a sign of the intolerance in country, which claims to be a democracy, that he died in Saudi Arabia,” said Salwa Riahi, a doctor in Tunis.  A former security chief, Ben Ali had run Tunisia for 23 years, taking power when, as prime minister in 1987, he declared president-for-life Habib Bourguiba medically unfit to rule.  In office, he sought to stifle any form of political dissent while opening up the economy, a policy that led to rapid growth but also fuelled grotesque inequality and accusations of brazen corruption, not least among his own relatives.  During that era, his photograph was displayed in every shop, school and government office from the beach resorts of the Mediterranean coast to the impoverished villages and mining towns of Tunisia’s hilly interior.  On the few occasions his rule was put to the vote, he faced only nominal opposition and won re-election by more than 99%.  On Sunday, by contrast Tunisians chose between 26 candidates including both Ben Ali’s own former supporter Moussi and an ex-political prisoner running for the Islamist Ennahda party, which he banned.  Ben Ali’s rise began in the army after Bourguiba won Tunisia’s independence from France in 1956. He was head of military security from 1964, and of national security from 1977.  After a three-year stint as ambassador to Poland, he was called back to his old security job in 1984 to quell riots over bread prices. Now a general, he was made interior minister in 1986 and prime minister in 1987.  It took him less than three weeks to arrange a new promotion to the top job, bringing in a team of doctors to declare Bourguiba senile, meaning he would automatically take over as head of state.  His first decade as president involved a big economic restructuring - backed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank - and an annual growth rate slightly over 4% a year.   Wedged between Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya and an Algeria thrust into civil war between the army-backed government and Islamist militants, Ben Ali’s Tunisia followed the post-independence path of secularism and openness to the outside.  But within, critics said it was a police state where few dared challenge an all-powerful government. In a country where many had experienced life under democracy elsewhere, Ben Ali’s oppressive state was reason to chafe.  Meanwhile, the elite were accumulating wealth in their extravagant seaside villas. The lavish lifestyle of Ben Ali’s wife, Leila Trabelsi, and her clique of rich relatives, came to symbolise the corruption of an era.  Out in the provinces, in the shabby towns of the south and the rural villages without running water, anger was growing, leading to a small protest movement in 2008, sometimes called “the little revolution”.

Tunisians often complain that living standards have dropped since the revolution, and speak of life under Ben Ali as more materially comfortable. But few speak with nostalgia of his style of rule, or say they want an end to democracy.  For Ben Ali, the sudden end came when a desperate vegetable seller in the humble town of Sidi Bouzid set himself alight in December 2010 after police confiscated his barrow.  Mohammed Bouazizi’s funeral was attended by tens of thousands of furious people, sparking weeks of ever bigger protests in which scores of people were killed.

728,It'll not take Smith long to be the captain again: Ponting,"Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said that once the captaincy ban of batsman Steve Smith ends, it'll not take long for him to be named as the team's captain again. ""I don't know what the Australian public might think about that,"" he added. Steve Smith was banned for two years from captaincy for his role in the 2018 ball-tampering scandal.",Times Now,"Steve Smith is being hailed as a phenom following his astounding effort with the willow in the recently concluded Ashes 2019. The Aussie batsman piled up as many as 774 runs in just seven innings at an average of more than 100 as he helped Australia retain the Ashes for the first time since 2001 on English soil. While Smith has returned to the Australia squad as just a player, not captain, former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting has backed Smith to take the captain’s armband sooner or later.However, Ponting was unsure of how things would be taken in Australia if Smith is made the captain of the team once again. The 30-year-old was sacked from captaincy following his involvement in the infamous sandpaper ball-tampering scandal in 2018 which rocked Australia cricket.Smith was handed out a 12-month ban along with David Warner while Cameron Bancroft was given a nine-month ban. In addition to the ban, it was stated by Cricket Australia that Smith won’t be considered for a leadership role for a year after the ban finishes.""Steve Smith – I think he will captain again. I don't know what the Australian public might think about that,"" Ponting said at an event at Australia House in London.""So to me that seems like Cricket Australia has left the gate open ... so if Cricket Australia thinks it's OK then I'm happy with [it,]"" Ponting added.The former Aussie skipper said Smith knows his role in the team even without the captain’s armband. Ponting reckoned that it won’t be too long until Smith is back being the captain of the team once the ban is lifted.""I think he knows his role now. But once that ban is lifted, I don't think it will be too long until he's captain again,"" Ponting said.Tim Paine’s captaincy came under the scanner during Ashes 2019 following glovesman's repeated failure of successfully taking DRS. It was a DRS mistake by Paine and Australia which had cost them the Headingley Test.Paine’s batting form has also been a talking point for quite some time now. Since October 2018, Paine has managed to score just two half-centuries in Test cricket and such things may play a role if he is to be removed from captaincy role in future. However, it will be interesting to see how the Australian fans react if Smith is given the captain’s armband once again.",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/i-think-he-will-captain-again-ricky-ponting-backs-steve-smith-to-become-australias-captain/491372?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
730,UP progressing at bullock-cart speed: Akhilesh Yadav,"After Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath claimed that the state has seen development during his tenure so far, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said UP is developing at snail's pace. ""The pace of development is not that of a double-engine machine but of a bullock cart,"" he added. ""The UP government is making false claims and celebrating,"" Yadav further said.",The Financial Express,"Opposition parties Thursday contested Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s claims on development and law and order during the first half of his term, with the Samajwadi Party saying Uttar Pradesh is moving at the speed of a bullock cart.“The UP government is making false claims and celebrating the completion of two-and-a-half years. People thought that with a double engine the state’s progress will gain momentum, but it is moving ahead at a snail’s pace,” SP president Akhilesh Yadav said.The “double engine” was a reference to the BJP’s earlier claim that the state will develop quicker with the same party in power in Lucknow and at the Centre.“The pace of the state’s development is not that of a double-engine machine but of a bullock cart,” Yadav said.The opposition attack followed Adityanath’s press conference here on his government reaching the mid-point of its five-year term. Adityanath had claimed that the perception about the state has changed during his term and the “improvement” in law and order had played an important role in this.“There has not been a single incident of riot in the state in the past two-and-half years,” Adityanath said, referring apparently to large-scale communal clashes. The Opposition parties disagreed.“The chief minister’s claims on law and order are far from truth. The reality is that during his tenure crime against girls has hit an all-time high,” Yadav said.“So many murders never took place in the past,” he claimed. “UP has surpassed other states in incidents of loot, rape and murder.”Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar said, “The law and order scenario in the state is grim.”“There is fear in the minds of the people. Incidents of rape are being reported from different parts of the state. Atrocities committed on women and murders are taking place at busy locations in the state capital,” Babbar alleged.Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said the BJP government’s record in the state so far has been “disappointing”.“This government has failed badly particularly on law and order and controlling crime,” she tweeted in Hindi.Congress spokesman Anshu Awasthi said the government’s “only achievement” has been saving “rapist MLAs” and leaders associated with it.Rashtriya Lok Dal spokesperson Anil Dubey also referred to crime against women and the notices served by the National Human Rights Commission to the state.The remarks were an indirect reference to the rape accusation against former Union minister Swami Chinmayanand in Shahjahanpur and a similar charge against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Unnao.Though the Shahjahanpur woman recorded her statement before a magistrate on Monday, an FIR mentioning the rape charge is yet to be lodged in the state.The police, however, say they are following procedure and will submit a report to the Supreme Court after completing their probe by September 23.During his press meet, Adityanath said the prosecution in sexual assault cases against minors has been speeded up.He gave an example from Auraiya, in which a life imprisonment sentence has already been pronounced for a rape committed in the first week of August.Akhilesh Yadav claimed the BJP government is patting itself on back over farm loan waiver but the farmers are still committing suicide.Congress spokesperson Awasthi asked, “What happened to the promise to the youth on providing jobs?”“This government has, however, been successful in organising big events by spending a lot of money, claiming investment of over Rs 4.28 lakh crore through the investors’ summit. But what is the result? They lack the right intention of seeing these development projects become a reality,” he said.RLD’s Dubey claimed the Adityanath government has failed to keep its promises not only on law and order, but also on issues concerning farmers, youth and women.“Inflation, power tariff hike and unemployment are glaring issues but the government has remained busy in just patting its back without caring for the problems of the common man,” Dubey added.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

734,Many options short of war with Iran: Trump after Saudi attacks,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said there were many options short of war with Iran after drone attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities. Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said were used in the attacks, describing them as evidence of Iran's involvement. Trump recently ordered the US Treasury to ""substantially"" increase the sanctions on Iran.",Reuters,"LOS ANGELES/JEDDAH (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday there were many options short of war with Iran after U.S. ally Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said were used in a crippling attack on its oil sites that was “unquestionably sponsored” by Tehran.  “There are many options. There’s the ultimate option and there are options that are a lot less than that. And we’ll see,” Trump told reporters in Los Angeles. “I’m saying the ultimate option meaning go in — war.” The president struck a cautious note as his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during a visit to Saudi Arabia, described the attacks as “an act of war” on the kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter. Trump said on Twitter that he had ordered the U.S. Treasury to “substantially increase sanctions” on Iran, which denies carrying out the attacks, and told reporters the unspecified, punitive economic measures would be unveiled within 48 hours. Trump’s tweet followed repeated U.S. assertions that the Islamic Republic was behind Saturday’s attacks and came hours after Saudi Arabia said the strike was a “test of global will”. Iran again denied involvement in the Sept. 14 raids, which hit the world’s biggest crude oil processing facility and initially knocked out half of Saudi output. Saudi Arabia is the world’s leading oil exporter.  Responsibility was claimed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which on Wednesday gave more details of the raid, saying it was launched from three sites in Yemen.  In a remark that may further strain a tense political atmosphere in the Gulf, the Houthis said they had listed dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh’s top Arab ally, as possible targets for attacks. To bolster its assertion that Iran was responsible, Saudi Arabia showed drone and missile debris it said amounted to undeniable evidence of Iranian aggression.  A total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks sponsored by Iran but not launched from Yemen, Defense Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told a news conference.”The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,” he said, adding Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were used in addition to cruise missiles. An investigation into the origin of the attacks was still under way and the result will be announced later, he said. The attack exposed gaps in Saudi air defenses despite billions spent on Western military hardware. Proof of Iranian responsibility, and evidence that the attack was launched from Iranian territory, could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response. Both nations, however, were stressing the need for caution.  Trump has previously said he does not want war and is coordinating with Gulf and European states. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, said the strike was a “real test of the global will” to confront subversion of the international order. His envoy to London, Prince Khalid bin Bander, told the BBC the attack was “almost certainly” Iranian-backed: “We’re trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.” The Islamic Republic dismissed the allegations. “They want to impose maximum ... pressure on Iran through slander,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said.  “We don’t want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?” he added, blaming Washington and its Gulf allies for the war in Yemen. Yemen’s Houthi movement, battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition for more than four years, said it used drones to assault state oil company Aramco’s sites. U.S. officials, however, have said the attack was not launched by the Houthis. The raid exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure and threw down a gauntlet to the United States, which wants to curb Iranian influence in the region. “The attack is like Sept. 11th for Saudi Arabia. It is a game changer,” said one Saudi security analyst. Visiting Jeddah, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attacks would be a major focus of next week’s annual U.N. General Assembly meeting and suggested Saudi Arabia could make its case there. “It was an act of war against them directly, and I’m confident they will do that,” he told reporters before meeting the Saudi crown prince, later tweeting that the United States supports Saudi Arabia’s right to defend itself.         The two men “agreed that the Iranian regime must be held accountable for its continued aggressive, reckless, and threatening behavior,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement after their talks. U.N. officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were also heading to Saudi Arabia to investigate. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a major confrontation in the Gulf would have “devastating consequences” for the region and globally.  France, which is trying to salvage an international nuclear deal with Iran that Washington quit last year, said it wanted to establish the facts before reacting. A U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday the strikes originated in southwestern Iran. Three officials said they involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating more complexity and sophistication than initially thought. Saudi Arabia’s finance minister told Reuters the attack had no impact on revenues and Aramco was continuing to supply markets without interruption. U.S. efforts to bring about a U.N. Security Council response looked unlikely to succeed as Russia and China have veto powers and were expected to shield Iran. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has offered to sell  defense systems to Riyadh, called for a “thorough and impartial” probe during a phone call with Prince Mohammed. IRAN-U.S. CONFLICT The 2015 nuclear deal ushered in a brief detente in long hostile relations between Iran and the United States. But antagonism returned when Trump pulled out of the pact, reached before he took office, and reimposed sanctions, severely damaging the Iranian economy. Iran has ruled out talks with Washington unless it returns to the pact.   Trump said he is not looking to meet Rouhani at the United Nations next week. Rouhani and his foreign minister may not attend the annual General Assembly at all unless U.S. visas are issued in the coming hours, Iranian state media reported. Washington and its Gulf allies want Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, as well as to put more limitations on its nuclear and missile programs.

740,Smith is a better Test batsman than Indian skipper Kohli: Panesar,"Spinner Monty Panesar has said that Australia batsman Steve Smith is a better Test batsman than Virat Kohli. ""But if you take an overall package, especially limited-overs, Virat stands out. He is overall a world-class batsman. Virat is the best batsman in the world. Smith is the best Test batsman in the world,"" Panesar added.",CricTracker,"There’s very little doubt that Steve Smith and Virat Kohli are two of the best batsmen in world cricket currently. Smith made a staggering comeback to the Australian team in the recently concluded Ashes series. While most experts are divided and aren’t too sure who is the better amongst the two, many are backing Steve Smith in Tests.Former England off-spinner Monty Panesar is also of the opinion that Smith is the better of the two batsmen. Smith has twenty-six centuries to Kohli’s twenty-five centuries. As an overall package, he is a tad behind Kohli but only when it comes to crowning the best in the longest form of the game, the Indian skipper comes second best.Advertisement“Steve Smith is a better Test batsman than Virat Kohli,” Panesar told The Times of India (TOI) in an exclusive interview. “But if you take an overall package, especially limited-overs, Virat stands out. He is overall a world class batsman. Virat is the best batsman in the world. Smith is the best Test batsman in the world,” said Panesar.Monty Panesar who played fifty Tests for England claiming 167 wickets praised India’s premier batsman even more by saying that with his consistency and ability he surely will beat Sachin Tendulkar’s record of hundred international centuries.The left-arm spinner also had some ravishing words of praise to share about India’s speed sensation Jasprit Bumrah. Bumrah has changed the landscape of Indian fast bowling according to Panesar. He felt that the pacer would go on to achieve more laurels for the country and said that his stint under Sachin Tendulkar with the Mumbai Indians led to his growth.“I am sure Sachin has played a crucial role in Bumrah’s development. He has a huge influence on him. What length to bowl, how to swing, how to judge a batsman- all these things he has learnt so quickly. How you think about the game and how you tactically take the right decisions- all these things Bumrah has learnt so fast under the able guidance of Sachin,” Panesar stated.Monty Panesar does make some valid observations. Steve Smith is probably the best in Test cricket now, the way in which he made a stunning, almost unbelievable comeback to the team post a one-year ban speaks volumes about his physical and mental strength. Overall, definitely India’s crown Virat Kohli would rank ahead of Smith and it won’t be too surprising to see him overtake Sachin Tendulkar’s coveted record of 100 international centuries.",https://www.crictracker.com/steve-smith-is-a-better-test-batsman-than-indian-skipper-virat-kohli-reckons-monty-panesar/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

We’ve got the best bowling attack in the world and the basis for a great batting line-up.”Australia retaining the Ashes was built on the back of an incredible series by former skipper Steve Smith, who scored 774 runs in just seven innings, and an impressive bowling attack led by Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.Paine called Smith “a freak” while also praising Marnus Labuschagne as having “a huge future” after he too enjoyed a stellar tour with the bat. But he revealed the last Test was a struggle for himself and fast bowler Peter Siddle.“My thumb was broken towards the end of that Test but it is not displaced, so I should be right to get back into training early,” said Paine, while praising workhorse Siddle who was battling a hip injury.“He has copped a bit of criticism for not bowling as well as… we know he can, but the team knows just how heroic he was. A lot of other people wouldn’t have bowled again in the match, but he pushed on because he didn’t want to leave Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to do extra work.”Coming off a long overseas tour and with five home Tests starting from November 21, Paine said he needs to rest and will not play the domestic Big Bash League Twenty20 competition this season.“Being captain is draining and I think I should take every chance to recharge my batteries,” he said.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/australia-have-got-the-best-bowling-attack-in-the-world-tim-paine-893114?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

750,US drone strike accidentally kills 30 pine nut farmers in Afghanistan,"A US drone strike intended to hit an Islamic State hideout accidentally killed at least 30 pine nut farmworkers in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, officials said. The strike came as the farmers were resting after having finished collecting pine nuts. Around 150 workers were there for harvesting, with some missing after the strike, the owner of the pine nuts field said.",Reuters,"JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A U.S. drone strike intended to hit an Islamic State (IS) hideout in Afghanistan killed at least 30 civilians resting after a day’s labour in the fields, officials said on Thursday. The attack on Wednesday night also injured 40 people after accidentally targeting farmers and labourers who had just finished collecting pine nuts at mountainous Wazir Tangi in eastern Nangarhar province, three Afghan officials told Reuters. “The workers had lit a bonfire and were sitting together when a drone targeted them,” tribal elder Malik Rahat Gul told Reuters by telephone from Wazir Tangi.  Afghanistan’s Defence Ministry and a senior U.S official in Kabul confirmed the drone strike, but did not share details of civilian casualties. “U.S. forces conducted a drone strike against Da’esh (IS) terrorists in Nangarhar,” said Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. “We are aware of allegations of the death of non-combatants and are working with local officials to determine the facts.” About 14,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, training and advising Afghan security forces and conducting counter-insurgency operations against IS and the Taliban movement. Haidar Khan, who owns the pine nut fields, said about 150 workers were there for harvesting, with some still missing as well as the confirmed dead and injured. A survivor of the drone strike said about 200 labourers were sleeping in five tents pitched near the farm when the attack happened. “Some of us managed to escape, some were injured but many  were killed,” said Juma Gul, a resident of northeastern Kunar province who had travelled along with labourers to harvest and shell pine nuts this week. Angered by the attack, some residents of Nangarhar province demanded an apology and monetary compensation from the U.S. government. “Such mistakes cannot be justified. American forces must realise (they) will never win the war by killing innocent civilians,” said Javed Mansur, a resident of Jalalabad city.  Scores of local men joined a protest against the attack on Thursday morning as they helped carry the victims’ bodies to Jalalabad city and then to the burial site.  Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor said the aerial attack was meant to target IS militants who often use farmlands for training and recruitment purposes, but had hit innocent civilians.     Jihadist IS fighters first appeared in Afghanistan in 2014 and have since made inroads in the east and north where they are battling the government, U.S. forces and the Taliban. The exact number of IS fighters is difficult to calculate because they frequently switch allegiances, but the U.S. military estimates there are about 2,000. There was no word from IS on the attack.  There has been no let-up in assaults by Taliban and IS as Afghanistan prepares for a presidential election this month. In a separate incident, at least 20 people died in a suicide truck bomb attack on Thursday carried out by the Taliban in the southern province of Zabul. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting across Afghanistan after the collapse of U.S.-Taliban peace talks this month. The Taliban has warned U.S. President Donald Trump will regret his decision to abruptly call off talks that could have led to a political settlement to end the 18-year-old war. The United Nations says nearly 4,000 civilians were killed or wounded in the first half of the year.

754,"People will target Sindhu at Olympics, they've year to plan: Coach","Badminton coach Pullela Gopichand has said that PV Sindhu, who recently became the first Indian to win a gold at the World Championships, will be a strong contender for the gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. ""There is competition...it...just gets more for Sindhu because she will be the target, people have a year to plan against her,"" he added.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Pusarla Sindhu will be a strong contender for the women’s gold medal at next year’s Tokyo Olympics but the 24-year-old’s recent World Championship triumph will also make her a target, India’s national coach Pullela Gopichand said. Sindhu won India’s first-ever title at the world badminton championships when she defeated Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara 21-7 21-7 to win the women’s singles in Basel last month. It was also an end to Sindhu’s frustrating near-misses, having finished runner-up at the 2016 Olympics, last year’s Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and the previous two world championships finals. With her silver from Rio, Sindhu is already India’s most successful female Olympian but the latest triumph also boosted the nation’s hopes of a medal in Tokyo next year. “I think it would be fair to say that she would be one of the big contenders for the gold medal,” Gopichand told Reuters in an interview. “But having said that, there is competition, and it just gets more for Sindhu because she will be the target, people have a year to plan against her.  “So, of course she needs to train, she needs to evolve, she needs to add new thinking to the armoury and that’s very important.” While India’s field hockey team have won eight Olympic titles, shooter Abhinav Bindra remains the only individual gold medallist for the country of 1.3 billion, who are starved of top sporting success outside cricket. In the world championships semi-finals, an aggressive Sindhu dismantled China’s Chen Yufei 21-7 21-14 while it took her just 38 minutes in the final to see off Okuhara with the Japanese player wilting under a barrage of smashes from her opponent.      Gopichand was delighted with Sindhu’s aggression and termed the manner of her championship win as “very special”. He, however, warned her ward to continue to evolve ahead of Tokyo. “It will not be fair to say that there is no competition,” Gopichand said.  “I think players like (current Olympic champion) Carolina Marin, Tai Tzu-Ying, Ratchanok (Intanon), the Chinese girls, I think there are a lot of players who will be competition and it’ll be disrespectful to write off competition.  “Having said that, I think Sindhu has a good chance and hopefully will come with the better medal than last time.” Badminton’s popularity has grown by leaps and bounds in the country with Saina Nehwal’s bronze in women’s singles in the London Olympics setting a success path. While the country was toasting the success of Sindhu, the men’s sport also got a significant boost when B. Sai Praneeth won bronze in Basel. It was the first world championship medal for a male shuttler since Prakash Padukone won a bronze medal in 1983. The likes of Nehwal, Sindhu and Sai Praneeth are all products of the Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad where they have prospered under the watchful eyes of the former All England champion. “Sai Praneeth did a very important thing. Sai’s performance was something I am really happy with,” Gopichand said. “Sai’s medal got eclipsed by Sindhu’s phenomenal performance.  “I think what Sai has achieved for men’s badminton and the men to actually win a world championship bronze medal is a good starting point to do even better in the future.” Gopichand, however, does not agree that India was badminton’s new China, which has been the dominant force in the sport for decades. “I don’t think we can say that unless we win team events, unless we have depth in all our events and a good bench strength.” Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman",https://in.reuters.com/article/badminton-india/badminton-pv-sindhu-primed-for-tokyo-gold-says-coach-idINKBN1W418F?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Netanyahu's Likud stood at 31 seats. ""During the elections, I called for the establishment of a right-wing government, but, sadly, the results of the elections have shown that this is not possible,"" said 69-year-old Netanyahu, pointing out that the nation did not definitively side with either bloc.ALSO READ| Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to skip UNGA session after polls setback""The Right cannot form a coalition and there should be as broad a unity government as possible. Therefore, there is no choice but to establish a wide unity government as wide as possible that's made up of all the officials that Israel called on,"" The Jerusalem Post quoted Netanyahu as saying.Netanyahu also asked Gantz, 60, to meet with him as soon as possible to start the process. ""I call on you MK Benny Gantz. Benny, it's on us to establish a wide unity government today. The nation expects us, the both of us, to work together. Let's meet today. At any time, at any moment. In order to begin this process that is demanded of us at this time. We cannot and have no reason to go to a third election. I oppose it. The call of the hour is to form a broad unity government today,"" said Netanyahu.Netanyahu recalled the unity government between Shimon Peres and his Likud rival Yitzhak Shamir that was created in the 1980s when the election results were similarly deadlocked. ""When there was no clear outcome from the Knesset elections, Shimon chose national unity. He and Yitzhak Shamir agreed to cooperate - to navigate Israel's path to safety,"" the Likud leader said.He called on Gantz to follow in Peres' footsteps, so that together they could similarly navigate Israel to safety, the paper said. His statement about the Peres-Shamir cooperation was seen as a reference to a possible rotation in the Prime Minister's Office. The paper added that Peres and Shamir rotated as prime ministers from 1984 to 1988. Blue and White rejected the offer as ""spin.""Meanwhile, the leaders of all the parties in the right-wing religious bloc on Thursday signed a document to recommend Netanyahu as the next prime minister and vowed to enter a coalition only as a single unit.

Netanyahu called the snap election after failing to form a governing coalition with a viable majority after April's vote.His victory in the April 9 polls securing him a record fifth term proved temporary in the face of a logjam between potential coalition partners over a military conscription bill governing exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students.With no clear winner, some analysts here see the chances of a coalition government coming in place quite bleak at the moment. Netanyahu, who has been premier for a total of more than 13 years, faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three cases.Israel has always had a coalition government and never seen a single party rule since its independence.

The Taliban, who have been carrying out nearly daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks with the United States this month, said the target was a nearby building of the government’s intelligence department in Qalat, the capital of Zabul province. “The bomb was huge and it was carried by a mini-truck,” said a senior defense ministry official in the capital, Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media. The militants wanted to target a training base for Afghanistan’s powerful National Directorate of Security, but parked the vehicle laden with explosives outside a hospital gate nearby, said another defense ministry source.  Twenty bodies and 95 wounded people had been evacuated from the blast site, said Haji Atta Jan Haqbayan, a member of the provincial council in Qalat. “The number of casualties may rise as rescue teams and people are still searching for bodies under the rubble,” he added. Several women, children, health workers and patients in the hospital were critically injured in the blast. There has been no let-up in Taliban attacks across Afghanistan as it prepares for a presidential election this month. The Taliban has warned that its fighters will step up their campaign against the Afghan government and foreign forces to dissuade people from voting in the Sept. 28 election. More than 9 million Afghans are expected to vote in the presidential election, during which the government has committed more than 70,000 security forces across Afghanistan to protection duties. U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly ended talks this month with the Taliban for a deal on the withdrawal of thousands of American troops from Afghanistan, in exchange for security guarantees from the hardline Islamist group. The talks, which did not include the Afghan government, were intended to lead to wider peace negotiations to end the 18-year-long war in Afghanistan.

Credit : wiki commonsThe company’s website says that it is looking at opportunities in design thinking and artificial intelligence (AI). Design thinking, as a term, was a big part of Sikka's narrative at Infosys. After Infosys, Sikka spent more than a year formulating the idea of how AI can help organisations scale business. There is a lot of value to be derived from AI. Larry Ellison, Chairman of Oracle, has been promoting it. In fact, Sikka recently made a presentation about the benefits of AI and about Vianai Systems at Oracle's Open World. The global business value derived from AI is projected to total $1.2 trillion in 2018, an increase of 70 percent from 2017, according to Gartner. AI-derived business value is forecast to reach $3.9 trillion in 2022.The Gartner AI-derived business value forecast assesses the total business value of AI across all the enterprise vertical sectors covered by Gartner. There are three different sources of AI business value: customer experience, new revenue, and cost reduction.""One of the biggest aggregate sources for AI-enhanced products and services acquired by enterprises between 2017 and 2022 will be niche solutions that address one need very well. Business executives will drive investment in these products, sourced from thousands of narrowly focused, specialist suppliers with specific AI-enhanced applications,” he added.AI business value growth shows the typical S-shaped curve pattern associated with any emerging technology. In 2018, the growth rate is estimated to be 70 percent, but it will slow down through 2022. After 2020, the curve will flatten, resulting in low growth over the next few years. And this is perhaps the reason why Sikka believes AI is going to change the future.

Beijing also released 2,400 tonnes of beef and 1,900 tonnes of mutton from state reserves this month, according to a statement published on the ministry’s website. Pork prices have jumped sharply recently and demand for the meat has fallen, the ministry said.  Graphic: China to release more meat from reserves to ensure supplies & cool pork prices     tmsnrt.rs/31za5sn The ministry said it would continue to monitor supplies and pork prices while coordinating with other government departments to release meat from state reserves as required to guarantee supply in the market. With a significant increase in meat imports and as the volume of frozen meat in reserves remains high, supplies are secured, it added. Thursday’s auction was seen by analysts as a symbolic gesture, however, and unlikely to cool pork prices. Those eclipsed 40 yuan ($5.64) per kilogramme in early September, almost 80% higher than a year earlier. “Our consumption is 12,000 tonnes a day,” said Ma Chuang, partner at Beijing-based consultancy Boyar. “It’s just a signal that the state is paying attention to the problem.” But Ma agreed that there was plenty of frozen meat in storage, with high prices being driven by the shortage in freshly slaughtered meat - much preferred over frozen in China - not a lack of meat overall. China celebrates its National Day on Oct. 1 with holidays lasting a whole week.  “During the holidays lots of people go travelling and eat out. The restaurants mainly use frozen meat so there won’t be a big impact,” said Ma, but he added that high prices were a longer-term concern. Pork prices in the world’s top consumer hit record levels after an epidemic of African swine fever that has reduced the hog herd by around 40%.

795,"Google to launch tokenised cards for Indian debit, credit card users","Google on Thursday announced that it's bringing tokenised cards to Indian debit and credit cardholders to allow them to pay for things using a digital token instead of their actual card number. The feature will be rolled out to Google Pay users in the coming weeks. It will start with Visa cards for HDFC, Axis, Kotak and Standard Chartered banks.",TechCrunch,"Google  said today it is bringing its mobile payments app — Google Pay — to businesses in India as the Android-maker rushes to maintain its payments lead in one of its key overseas markets before its global rival Facebook sets off a similar play in the nation.Even as more than 400 million users in India are online today, most businesses in the nation remain unconnected, Google executives said at their annual event in New Delhi. Google, which has previously launched a handful of tools in India to help businesses build some presence on the web, is having another crack at it.“India has more than 60 million small and medium-sized businesses, however only a fraction of them support digital payments. Imagine the transformation that is possible if more of these merchants could access payments online,” said Ambarish Kenghe, director and product manager for Google Pay.One of the big challenges that is preventing these businesses to support online payments is the tedious process that is currently required for them to on-board a digital payments solution. “An agent is supposed to come to your shop and then they do the verification for you,” he said. Google has figured out a better way to address this challenge.The company today unveiled Google Pay for Business, a standalone app that will enable businesses to accept online payments without having to deal with an agent. “Merchants will now be able to support digital payments at their own convenience through a remote video process within minutes,” he said.The company also unveiled a software platform called Spot that will allow businesses to easily create their own branded commercial fronts that will be accessible to customers through Google Pay app. So for instance, if a restaurant has built its store front, users will now be able to see their offerings in the Google Pay app itself. The company said several businesses in India like UrbanClap, Goibibo, MakeMyTrip, RedBus and Eat.Fit are already making use of this feature.“We hope these initiatives will help merchants adopt digital payments with more confidence, and help contribute the long-term growth of online financial services for the benefit of every Indian,” said Kenghe.The company has also developed Spot codes, which are like QR codes, that a business could use to allow people in its store to quickly scan and pick the items from the store they wish to order and pay for it. “A customer can come back later and pick up their orders without waiting in long lines,” explained Arjita Madan, a product manager at Google.The company is also bringing a feature that will enable users to discover entry-level and white-collar jobs through the Google Pay app. “Jobs will be available as a Spot on Google Pay to help job seekers find and prepare for entry-level positions that fit their needs,” said Caesar Sengupta (pictured above), VP of Next Billion Users Initiative and Payments at Google.He said Google is using machine learning to better understand its users, so that it recommends the right kind of jobs to them. A user only needs to provide two sets of information to get started with the feature: What kind of job are they looking for? And, how soon they want to land the job.About two dozen companies, including Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo in delivery and logistics and 24Seven and Healthkart in retail are early partners of Google to use Pay’s jobs discovery feature, the Mountain View giant said.Google launched its payments app Google Pay (called Tez then) in 2017. Pay is built on top of Indian government-backed UPI payments infrastructure and rivals Flipkart’s PhonePe app for the tentpole position. The company said today Google Pay has amassed 67 million monthly active users in India and has processed transactions worth $110 billion in the last year.The payments market in India — which is projected to be worth $1 trillion by 2023, according to Credit Suisse — is becoming aggressively crowded and competitive. Google today competes with PhonePe, Amazon Pay and Paytm, the country’s most popular mobile wallet app, whose parent company has raised more than $2.3 billion from investors.Google also announced that it is bringing tokenized cards for debit and credit cardholders in India, which will allow them to pay for things using a digital token instead of their actual card number. The company said it will roll out the feature to Google Pay users in the coming weeks, starting with Visa cards for HDFC, Axis, Kotak and Standard Chartered banks. The feature also will support Mastercard and Rupay at a later stage.The addition of new features is crucial for Google Pay, which prior to today’s announcements did not have many differentiating elements. It is also racing against time as Facebook’s WhatsApp, which has over 400 million users in India, is set to expand its UPI-based payments service to all its users by the end of the year.In the meantime, Paytm is working to expand its reach in the nation, too. The company, which posted a yearly loss of over $500 million last year, said earlier this month it intends to invest another $3 billion into its business in the next two years.Google is bringing Assistant to people without internet access",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/google-pay-job-business-india/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""Because I was using it, they've taken it away,"" he said.",The Wire,"New Delhi: A special CBI court on Thursday extended former finance minister P. Chidambaram’s judicial custody till October 3.The 74-year-old senior Congress leader, who was arrested by the investigative agency last month in connection with the controversial INX media case, was sent to judicial remand for 14 days on September 5.Chidambaram’s time in Tihar jail was supposed to end today.On Thursday afternoon, however, the CBI moved an application seeking an extension of judicial custody before the special court at the Rouse Avenue Court Complex.Senior advocate Abishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Chidambaram, argued that “reasonable grounds” must exist for extending judicial custody and that it should only be for four more days if granted.Singhvi also requested the court to order a medical examination of the former finance minister, who has reportedly lost weight over the last two weeks.Responding to these claims, solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that the health of any inmate at Tihar Jail is a concern and that medical care could be given as per the provisions of the law.Chidambaram also told that the court that he had “developed back pain” as he neither had a chair nor a pillow in his cell. While his lawyers were arguing for his release, Chidambaram interrupted to add, “There were chairs outside the room, I used to sit there during the day, now that too is withdrawn. Because I was using it, they have taken it away, now even the warden is without a chair.”Even as Singhvi added that he had a chair “three days ago, now there is no chair, no pillow either”, Mehta called it “a small issue”.“No need to sensationalise it. It’s a petty issue. There was no chair in his room from beginning,” he added.After deliberating over the matter, however, the court decided to extend Chidambaram’s judicial custody until October 3. The senior Congress leader will be allowed to meet his family on a regular basis in this time.Chidambaram’s bail hearing in this matter is expected to be heard by the Delhi high court next week.",https://thewire.in/law/inx-media-case-chidambaram-tihar-jail-october-3?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

A special CBI court had remanded Shivakumar to judicial custody till October 1 on Tuesday.",The News Minute,"Congress leader DK Shivakumar, who has been accused in a money laundering case, was sent to Tihar jail on Thursday. The senior party leader was undergoing treatment at RML Hospital and was taken to Tihar after being discharged from the hospital.On Tuesday, the CBI court in New Delhi remanded the senior leader to judicial custody until October 1. In the meantime, Lakshmi Hebbalkar the Karnataka Congress MLA from Belagavi, appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Delhi after she was summoned for questioning in connection to the case.The ED had been probing accusations of money laundering registered against DK Shivakumar since August 2017 when a cash amount of Rs 8.86 crores was found in the his New Delhi residence. He was arrested on September 3 after being accused of setting up hawala networks to launder money. A day later, he applied for bail which the ED rejected stating that Shivakumar would “influence witnesses.”KM Nataraj, the Additional Solicitor General representing the ED, stated that Shivakumar and his family members held more than 300 bank accounts altogether and had accused him of laundering over Rs 200 crore in cash.As part of the probe into the case back in 2017, the Income Tax Department found that some transactions made by the party leader were linked to Lakshmi Hebbalkar. Further, when the raids first took place on August 2, 2017, Shivakumar had made a phone call to Lakshmi.She had earlier been issued a summons by the ED to appear on September 14, but was unable to do so. The summons date was then pushed to September 19.Prior to this, DK Shivakumar’s daughter Aisshwarya appeared before the ED on September 12 and was questioned for seven hours in connection to the case. At the time, officials from the ED stated that she was being questioned about a trust fund set up in her name. The ED also interrogated her regarding the increase in her wealth between 2013 and 2018.

810,Woman held for daughter's death after giving her heroin to help sleep,A 33-year-old woman has been arrested in the US in connection with the death of her one-year-old daughter for allegedly giving her small doses of heroin over the course of two months to help her sleep. Kimberly Nelligan had also given heroin to her two older children in the past. She's been charged with child endangerment and possession of drugs.,Times Now,"New Delhi: Police in Maine, United States of America, have arrested a woman for allegedly giving her infant daughter small doses of heroin in order to help the child sleep. It is being reported by various media affiliates that these doses of heroin over a period of two months led to the baby's death. Based on statements from eyewitnesses, police have booked 33-year-old Kimberly Nelligan, the deceased child's mother.Nelligan has been charged with child endangerment and possession of drugs. At present, she is facing up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $2,000 for endangering the life of a child and up to 180 days in jail along with $1,000 fine for possession and use of drugs. The woman from Maine continued to showcase remorse even during her visits to the courthouse for the hearing. She was eventually granted bail but ordered to stay away from her husband and any children below 18 years of age.In his statement to the police, Nelligan's husband said that she rubbed heroin residue on their daughter's gums about 15 times over the course of the past two months. According to the medical examiner's office, acute fentanyl intoxication led to the child's death on October 10 of last year. The infant likely digested the drug that killed her, said a report. A potent synthetic opioid prescribed during the treatment of severe pain, fentanyl is also used for capital punishment in America.The Maine mom initially told police officers that she never consumed the drug. However, she later confessed to snorting heroin from time to time around the months surrounding her daughter's death. In addition, Nelligan also told officers probing the matter that she used the drug to put her other children to sleep in the past. The accused's husband confirmed that she rubbed their daughter's gums about 15 times with heroin residue.The mother in her affidavit wrote that she did not hurt her daughter on purpose. However, trouble for Nelligan could rise further with the investigation into the case still underway and police likely to frame more charges against her. District Attorney Marianne Lynch said that laws are not exactly designed to deal with serious and difficult cases such as this. Lynch added that prosecutors are confident of going ahead with the current charges for now and will act accordingly if new allegations emerge against Nelligan.",https://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/crime/article/mother-gives-heroin-to-calm-1-year-old-daughter-arrested-after-child-dies/491553?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

816,Britain heading for a no-deal Brexit: EU,"European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday warned that Britain was headed for a no-deal Brexit. The issue of Irish border, on whether to return to a hard border with security checks and tariffs with the European Union or not, remains unsolved. British PM Boris Johnson has insisted on leaving the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.",Reuters,"STRASBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union warned on Wednesday that Britain was headed for a damaging no-deal Brexit, with London’s ideas for solving the contentious issue of the Irish border still unlikely to unlock a deal just six weeks before Britain is due to leave. Addressing EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him on Monday that London still wanted a deal, but would leave with or without one on Oct. 31. “There is very little time left ... The risk of a no-deal is very real,” said Juncker, his comments weighing on sterling. Pro-Brexit lawmakers cheered and applauded in the Strasbourg chamber.  “It’s time for a clean-break Brexit,” said Brexit campaigner Matthew Patten. Other pro-Brexit EU deputies tried to shout down pro-EU British colleagues, shouting “You lost!” and “Rubbish!” A majority of EU lawmakers later voted for an extension to Britain’s scheduled departure date in a resolution that is not binding but which has political weight. EU leaders will meet for a make-or-break summit in Brussels on Oct. 17-18, just a fortnight before Brexit is due to materialise more than three years after Britons voted to leave. Britain is not likely to present a complete set of detailed, written proposals of how it would want the text of the existing - but stalled - Brexit deal changed before the end of the month, UK and EU sources said. “If that is the case, the summit will end with nothing,” an EU diplomat dealing with Brexit in Brussels said. “If there is to be a deal, it must be prepared to a large extent in advance. It is too technical to leave to the leaders at the last minute.” In a worst-case scenario, a no-deal Brexit could mean severe disruption to trade, supplies of medicines, fresh foods and  possible public disorder, according to the British government’s contingency plans. Such a sharp break in economic ties, ending four decades of EU membership, “might be the United Kingdom’s choice, but never the choice of the EU,” Juncker said, highlighting how the bloc wants to avoid blame if Britain crashes out. Juncker said London must present realistic proposals to replace the Irish backstop arrangement in the Britain-EU divorce agreement, which former premier Theresa May agreed with EU leaders but which was rejected by the British parliament. “I am not emotionally attached to the Irish backstop,” Juncker said. “I have asked the prime minister to make, in writing, alternatives,” he said, calling it a safety net to avoid a divided Ireland after Brexit.  The backstop would require Britain to obey some EU rules if no other way could be found to keep the land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland invisible. Johnson’s office said in a statement late on Wednesday that the British leader had spoken with Juncker and the president of the European Parliament to reassure them that work was underway to find an alternative to the backstop. “The Prime Minister and President Juncker discussed the positive and constructive conversation they had in Luxembourg on Monday and their shared determination to reach a deal,” a spokesperson for Johnson said. But Juncker’s pessimistic tone on Wednesday was echoed by Finland’s minister for European affairs, Tytti Tuppurainen, who told the parliament that a no-deal Brexit “is a quite likely outcome.” Finland holds the EU’s rotating presidency. However, many EU lawmakers warned against a no-deal, both to avoid an economic shock and because they do not want to see Britain abandon its commitments to EU social and environmental standards and become a low-tax, low-regulation rival. “We will not accept a Singapore on the North Sea,” said former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, a liberal EU lawmaker and a member of the parliament’s Brexit committee. In an at times bad-tempered debate underscoring general weariness on the tortured issue of Britain’s pending departure, senior EU lawmakers took jabs at the noisy contingent of British eurosceptic deputies in the chamber. Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right EPP group, called Brexit “stupid”. He and Verhofstadt took aim at British plans for greater sovereignty at a time when the parliament in Westminster has been suspended by Johnson. British pro-EU deputy Julie Ward called the prime minister “disreputable”.  “Brexiteers claimed Westminster would take back control, but now they shut it down,” Weber, a German lawmaker, said in Strasbourg, as the Supreme Court in London continued hearing arguments on whether Johnson acted unlawfully in suspending the parliament in the run-up to Brexit. The European Parliament formally called on Wednesday for Britain to be granted another extension to allow more time for London to agree the terms of its withdrawal.

823,Google Assistant to be available to Indian users without internet,"At its 'Google for India' event on Thursday, the company announced its virtual assistant will also be available to people who have the most basic cellphone with no internet access. A 24×7 telephone line on Vodafone-Idea telecom networks could be dialled by users to access the service. Google said it's been testing the line in Lucknow and Kanpur.",TechCrunch,"Google  Assistant, the digital assistant from the global search giant, is available to users through their smartphones, laptops and smart speakers. Earlier this year, the company partnered with KaiOS to bring Assistant to some feature phones with internet access. Now Google is going a step further: Bringing its virtual assistant to people who have the most basic cell phone with no internet access. It’s starting this program in India.At an event in New Delhi on Thursday, the company announced a 24×7 telephone line that anyone in India on Vodafone and Idea telecom networks (or Vodafone-Idea telecom network, as Vodafone owns Idea) could dial to have their questions answered. The company said it tested the phone line service with thousands of users across Lucknow and Kanpur before making it generally available.Users will be able to dial 000-800-9191-000 and they won’t be charged for the call or the service. Manuel Bronstein, a VP at Google, said through this program the company is hoping to reach hundreds of millions of users in India who currently don’t have access to smartphones or internet.Even as there are more than 500 million users with access to internet and about 450 million with smartphones in India, more than half of the nation’s 1.3 billion people remains unconnected.India has emerged as one of the last great growth markets for Silicon Valley companies that are looking to find their next billion users worldwide. But to reach these users, companies are required to put in some extra work: build and customize services to address the local challenges.On Wednesday, Amazon said its digital assistant service Alexa now understands and speaks Hindi. Only 10% of India’s 1.3 billion people speak English. There are over half a billion people in India who speak Hindi, however. Google said today that Hindi had already become the second most popular language for its digital assistant service.Google also unveiled a new Google Assistant feature called interpreter mode that will serve as a real-time translator between two people speaking different languages. Google said the feature would support translation between English and Hindi and will roll out in the coming months.Google Assistant, which supports nine Indian languages, now also allows users to ask their commands in a language that is not set as their preferred device language. “Many users often prefer to set the phone language to English, while choosing to speak to their device in their local language. That’s where language decoupling comes in — Indian users can now simply ask to change their Assistant language,” the company said.“Starting today, you can talk to your Assistant in the nine Indian languages for example, for talking in Hindi –you can simply say ‘Hey Google, talk to me in Hindi’ to start using the Assistant in the language, without needing to dig around in settings.”Google chases businesses to maintain its payments lead in India",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/google-assistant-no-internet-india/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
827,"Lyft faces lawsuit that alleges kidnapping at gunpoint, rape","US ride-hailing giant Lyft is facing another lawsuit pertaining to its handling of alleged sexual assaults by drivers on its platform. The lawsuit alleged that the plaintiff's driver kidnapped her at gunpoint and she was raped by the driver and other men. ""Alison remembers the men cheering and high-fiving each other as they continued to rape her,"" the lawsuit claimed.",TechCrunch,"Lyft  is facing another lawsuit pertaining to its handling of alleged sexual assaults at the hands of drivers on its platform. In a suit filed today in the San Francisco Superior Court, Alison Turkos accuses Lyft of 11 counts, including general negligence, vicarious liability for assault with a deadly weapon, sexual assault, sexual battery and breach of contract.The lawsuit describes how the plaintiff’s Lyft driver allegedly kidnapped her at gunpoint and took her across state lines, where the driver and other men took turns raping her, the lawsuits states.“Alison remembers the men cheering and high fiving each other as they continued to rape her,” the lawsuit alleges. “Their attack was so brutal that the next day Alison experienced severe vaginal pain and bleeding. Her body was so exhausted from the attack and resulting trauma that Alison could not even leave her bed or raise her arms.”When the plaintiff reported it to Lyft, the lawsuit alleges Lyft simply apologized for “inconvenience” and gave her a partial refund for the ride. Lyft, however, says the incident was not initially reported as a safety incident, but rather as an indirect route issue. Lyft says it did not become aware of the incident until May 2018, when the Wall Street Journal ran a piece on it.“What this rider describes is awful, and something no one should have to endure,” a Lyft spokesperson told TechCrunch. “The unfortunate fact remains that one in six women will face some form of sexual violence in their lives — behavior that’s unacceptable for our society and on our platform. In this case, the driver passed the New York City TLC’s background check and was permitted to drive.”The spokesperson added, “We constantly work to improve the platform, which is why we have invested in new features, protocols and policies to protect our riders and drivers. This year alone we’ve launched 14 new safety features — including daily continuous background check monitoring, in-app emergency assistance, and mandatory feedback for any ride rated less than four stars.”The plaintiff says she reported the crime to the police, who performed a rape kit that found evidence of semen from at least two men on the clothing she wore that night.The New York Police Department then transferred the case to the FBI, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit states the FBI is now investigating the incident as a human trafficking case. However, Lyft “has been wholly uncooperative” throughout the NYPD and FBI’s investigation, the lawsuit alleges.In May 2018, Lyft says it received a subpoena from law enforcement and worked with law enforcement for over a year during the investigation.The lawsuit seeks special damages, including economic restitution to cover past and future hospital expenses, as well as expenses relating to her profession and loss of earning capacity.“By failing to take reasonable steps to confront the problem of multiple rapes and sexual assaults of LYFT passengers by LYFT drivers, LYFT has acted in conscious disregard of the safety of its passengers,” the lawsuit alleges.This suit comes just weeks after 14 women filed suit against Lyft alleging the company has not addressed complaints pertaining to sexual assault. Both suits recommended Lyft adopt new policies, such as the addition to the app of a surveillance camera that can record audio and video of all rides.Meanwhile, Lyft recently announced new safety features, including trip check-ins if a ride seems to be taking longer than it should and in-app 911 calling.“We’re committed to playing a significant role in connecting our communities with transportation, and we understand the responsibilities that come along with that,” Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer wrote in a blog post. “We’ve known since the beginning that as part of our mission, we must heavily invest in safety. We continue to welcome accountability and partnership to best protect our rider and driver community.”It’s no coincidence that Lyft announced these safety features in light of the lawsuit on behalf of those 14 women. The company had previously taken some steps to address safety, but at a much slower pace than competitor Uber, which has also faced a number of sexual assault and abuse lawsuits. Between 2014-2018, CNN found 103 Uber drivers who had been accused of sexual assault or abuse of passengers.Over the years, both companies have taken steps to ramp up their respective safety procedures. In April, Uber launched a campus safety initiative while Lyft implemented continuous background checks and enhanced its identity verification process for drivers. Uber, however, implemented continuous background checks about a full year before Lyft, and added an in-app 911 calling feature more than a year before Lyft.“We don’t take lightly any instances where someone’s safety is compromised, especially in the rideshare industry, including the allegations of assault in the news last week,” Zimmer said earlier this month in that same blog post. “The reality is that certain populations carry a disproportionate burden simply trying to get to work or back home after a night out — in the U.S., one in six women will face some form of sexual violence in their lives. The onus is on all of us to learn from any incident, whether it occurs on our platform or not, and then work to help prevent them.”",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/lyft-faces-lawsuit-that-alleges-kidnapping-at-gunpoint-and-rape/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

852,"FB, Instagram to restrict cosmetic surgery, diet product posts","Facebook-owned Instagram has announced that the two platforms have started restricting some cosmetic surgery and diet product posts from September 18. The new rules will result in age restrictions being applied to some posts and other posts being removed entirely. ""This policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel,"" Instagram said.",Engadget,"You'll soon see fewer ads for ""flat tummy"" tea and lip fillers on Instagram. The social media platform announced today that it is tightening restrictions on posts related to diet products and cosmetic surgery. The new rules -- first reported in the London Evening Standard -- will apply to both Facebook and Instagram, and will result in age restrictions being applied to some posts and other posts being removed entirely.The social media platforms will ban posts promoting dubious weight loss products that are linked to a commercial offer (like a discount code). Furthermore, both will restrict users who are under 18 years old from viewing content that promote the use of certain weight loss products and cosmetic procedures.Instagram's public policy manager, Emma Collins, said in an interview with the London Evening Standard that the platform worked with external experts to make this change without ruining the spirit of Instagram. ""We want Instagram to be a positive place for everyone that uses it and this policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel as a result of social media,"" said Collins.Dr. Ysabel Gerrard, a professor at the University of Sheffield and one of the outside experts Instagram consulted prior to the change, tweeted that she worked with a team of academics, activists and practitioners, including actress Jameela Jamil. According to Gerrard, Instagram will remove posts that make a ""miraculous claim"" about a diet or weight loss product. Users will also be able to report posts they believe are in violation of the rules.""Miraculous claims means they aren't sustainable. Products like skinny teas, these have been publicly criticised as they offer short term solutions to something that naturally takes a lot longer.

858,SoftBank CEO took $3-bn loan to invest in Vision Fund: Bloomberg,"SoftBank Group's Founder and CEO Masayoshi Son loaned himself around $3 billion to invest in the Japanese conglomerate's first, $100-billion Vision Fund, Bloomberg reported citing sources. The 62-year-old has pledged 38% of his stake in the Japanese firm as collateral for personal loans from 19 banks, regulatory filings revealed. The loan was swapped for equity in the fund, Bloomberg added.",Bloomberg Quint,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son, who built a $15.2 billion fortune investing in tech startups like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., is betting on himself more than ever, even as his empire shows signs of vulnerability.The SoftBank Group Corp. founder has pledged 38% of his stake in the Japanese firm as collateral for personal loans from 19 banks, including Credit Suisse Group AG and Julius Baer Group Ltd., according to a June regulatory filing. That’s up from 36% at the start of the year and triple the level in June 2013.“It lets him monetize a large share of his wealth without foregoing influence over the firm,” said Michael Puleo, assistant professor of finance at Fairfield University’s Dolan School of Business in Connecticut. “But there’s an elevation of crash risk. If the share price falls low enough, he could get a margin call and that could be pretty costly.”The structure highlights the extent of Son’s exposure to SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund. Shares in the Japanese conglomerate have been rocked recently by the postponement of WeWork’s initial public offering. The delay came after the office-rental unicorn was being marketed at a steep discount to the $47 billion figure that the Tokyo-based conglomerate invested at earlier this year. That’s spooked investors, who’ve sent SoftBank’s shares down 4.6% this week through Thursday as the listing unraveled, knocking about $700 million off Son’s net worth. The stock has still advanced 26% this year.Son, 62, also has leveraged his stake in the Vision Fund, which invests in tech startups. That boosts his returns if things go well, with outsized losses if they don’t. Uber Technologies Inc.’s falling market capitalization and WeWork’s travails are set to dent the 62% return on the fund that SoftBank reported through March.“There is a danger in companies where the founder calls all the shots regardless of whether there are loans,” said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer with the MIT Sloan School of Management in Boston. “And when founders borrow a lot against their shares, they might be more tempted to make riskier decisions,” he said, adding that borrowing against 5% of one’s stake is usually considered prudentd.SoftBank’s compensation plan also involves a lot of debt. Son loaned himself around $3 billion to invest in the first Vision Fund, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Using loans for a private investment compounds Son’s risk because he would be less able to bail himself out if things go south, Pozen said.The loan was swapped for equity in the fund and will generate profits when deals make money -- and losses when they don’t. Vision Fund employees, including high-profile bankers and investors, receive base salaries and bonuses, but only get payouts when profits are booked.It’s unclear how much of this compensation will be reported in SoftBank’s next annual report. Son’s pledged shares, which currently have a market value of $9 billion, are excluded from his net worth calculation by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. SoftBank spokeswoman Hiroe Kotera declined to comment.SoftBank is planning to lend as much as $20 billion to its employees to buy stakes in a second venture capital fund, the people said. Son may account for over half of the employee investment pool, they said.Pledged shares have become an increasingly common way for founders to unlock the value of a stake without selling shares. Larry Ellison has a history of pledging Oracle Corp. stock to fund a lavish lifestyle, which includes trophy properties, America’s Cup teams and the Indian Wells tennis tournament. About 27% of his Oracle shares -- worth more than $16 billion -- are currently pledged. Elon Musk has pledged about 40% of his stake in Tesla Inc., according to a May 2019 filing.Still, the move comes with risks. “If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further,” Tesla warned in a filing.The risk-loving Son, who saw $70 billion wiped from his fortune in the dot-com crash, is unlikely to be fazed. He told shareholders at the company’s June meeting that SoftBank’s investment portfolio could grow 33-fold to 200 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion) in 20 years.©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/softbank-founder-s-leveraged-fortune-vulnerable-to-wework-woes?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Meanwhile, Manchester City defeated Shakhtar Donetsk 3-0, while Juventus were held to a 2-2 draw by Atletico Madrid. On Tuesday, defending champions Liverpool suffered a 0-2 defeat at the hands of Napoli.",Reuters,"PARIS (Reuters) - Angel Di Maria scored twice in a vintage performance to help Paris St Germain outclass Real Madrid 3-0 in their opening Champions League Group A game on Wednesday. In the absence of the formidable attacking trio of Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Edinson Cavani, Di Maria provided two first-half goals as PSG suffocated Real throughout and Thomas Meunier added a third in stoppage time. Real, European champions 13 times and three years in a row from 2016-18, failed to muster a shot on target and suffered their first defeat of the season. PSG lead the standings on three points, ahead of Club Brugge and Galatasaray, who played out a goalless draw earlier on Wednesday. “We lacked intensity, we never got into the game, we created very few chances,” Real coach Zinedine Zidane told a news conference. Although PSG’s win could be seen as a statement, the French champions still have a long way to go before putting three consecutive last-16 eliminations behind them for good including last season’s embarrassing defeat by Manchester United. “We played at a very very high level tonight, but it’s not easy to show this in every game,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. With Neymar suspended and Mbappe and Cavani injured, Argentine Mauro Icardi started up front after playing his first half hour for PSG in a Ligue 1 game against Strasbourg last weekend. He had little impact, though, as Di Maria made sure his compatriot’s lack of match time went unnoticed in PSG’s first European game since a shock 3-1 home defeat by United sent them out of last season’s Champions League.  Eden Hazard started for Real, who eliminated PSG in the last 16 in 2017-18, and they were also without the injured Marcelo, Isco, Luka Modric, Marco Asensio and Fede Valverde as well as the suspended Sergio Ramos and Nacho Fernandez. PSG started fast and were rewarded for their early domination in the 14th minute when Di Maria stabbed the ball past Thibaut Courtois at the near post from Juan Bernat’s cross. It was former Real player Di Maria’s 25th goal in his 100th appearance in European competition. He made it 26 in the 33rd minute, curling a superb shot past Courtois from 20 metres after Idrissa Gueye had cut through the Real midfield. Real forward Gareth Bale found the back of the net shortly afterwards but the goal was ruled out by the VAR for handball. PSG left little space to Real and Di Maria came close to making it 3-0, only for his chip to land on the roof of the net after the Argentine had been sent through by the impressive Gueye. Real striker Karim Benzema beat Keylor Navas from close range in the 77th minute, but the goal was ruled out because Lucas Vazquez was offside. Full back Meunier wrapped up an emphatic win when he scored from close range one minute into stoppage time following a PSG counter-attack.

The application was filed in terms of ""downloadable computer software for use in capturing and recording video"".",Engadget,"You might have rolled your eyes when Apple mentioned that the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro could do ""slofies,"" but the company is taking things slightly more seriously.  Apple has applied to the USPTO for a trademark on the term ""Slofie"" in terms of ""downloadable computer software for use in capturing and recording video.""  Don't worry, it's not trying to own the cultural landscape -- rather, this is largely to prevent app developers and phone makers from 'borrowing' the term for their own features.The company doesn't refer to the clips as ""slofies"" outside of its marketing for the new iPhones.  It's not that heavily invested in the concept, thankfully.  However, the trademark application is something of a hedge.  It doesn't want to be caught off-guard if the term ever catches on.

In a video message, Singh said, ""Six months ago, we had initiated a camp. We had invited Hindus from all over the country. I want to inform that this camp is going very well.""",The News Minute,"BJP MLA Raja Singh from Hyderabad has announced the creation of a vigilante army to ‘deal with’ traitors and ‘send them to hell’. In two videos released on Wednesday, the always-controversial, often-bigoted legislator proudly claimed that he is currently holding a conference discussing the formation of this vigilante army.Raja Singh in his video said, “Six months back, we had planned a camp, decided on a date, and invited Hinduvadi bravehearts and patriots to attend the camp. There’s a great discussion underway at this camp (now). A pledge has been taken at this camp that every youngster in India will be trained to become a soldier; India is safe because of our Army, similarly the Indian youth will be readied like an Army soldier. If India needs it in the coming days, the Indian youngsters should not fall behind. The Army is taking care of traitors on the outside. But there should also be an army to take care of the terrorists inside the house right? So that army is now being readied.”“This army will be created in every corner of India. In the coming days, whichever traitor is hidden inside India, will be dragged out and worn down, and sent outside India – or even directly to Jahannum (hell),” Raja Singh threatened, “This is our pledge, this is our programme.”“This programme will go on for seven more days, and we will continue to have great discussions,” he said, hinting that this diabolical vigilante army was only the beginning of his anti-national activities.In another video released on the same day, he said, “We have a determination/commitment towards Hindu rashtra, for this Hindu rashtra, we need an army. How can this army be formed? All over India, we are forming an army for Hindu rashtra, the protection of dharma and the nation. For this, there's a ten day camp for which we have come to Bengaluru.”While one of the videos was uploaded to his Facebook page, the other was shared through WhatsApp. The exact location of this camp in Bengaluru is unclear. When TNM asked Raja Singh, he refused to divulge the location, but said that 470 people were participating in the event and that the camp would continue till September 24.As per his latest election affidavit, Raja Singh has 43 police cases against him. Recently, the Ghoshamahal MLA tried to stoke communal tensions in Hyderabad, when he tried erecting a huge statue of freedom fighter Rani Avanti Bai at Jumerat Bazar without permission from the authorities. The incident led to tension in the area. Initially the BJP claimed that police lathicharged the BJP supporters, leaving Raja Singh injured. However, a video showing the MLA hitting himself with a stone busted their claim.   ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hyd-bjp-mla-raja-singh-announces-vigilante-army-deal-anti-nationals-109097?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This is my roadmap for PoK,” the governor said.Malik urged the countrymen to treat people from Kashmir with love and respect and said officers have been placed in every state to help Kashmiri students.“There are 22,000 Kashmiri students studying in different states of the country and they should be treated love. People of Kashmir should be treated with love and respect,” he added.Referring to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) registering cases to probe the alleged irregularities in the Roshni scheme, he said it apparently turned out to be a Rs 25,000 crore scam.“The implementation of the scheme has been such that it has proved to be a Rs 25,000 crore scam … When I came here, the first thing I did was to end the Roshni scheme and we handed the Roshni cases to the ACB for investigation,” he said.The Jammu and Kashmir government in 1996 launched the scheme to vest land ownership rights on people who were occupying state land by paying a part of its assessed value towards the public exchequer. The aim of the scheme was to regularise illegal occupants while generating funds for construction of power projects in the state.Malik said the government has taken steps to ensure uninterrupted power supply to Jammu and Srinagar cities from this winter.The governor thanked Union Power Minister R K Singh, who was also present in the function, for his generous support to the power sector in the state.“At my request, he (Singh) has reduced the time for laying of Leh-Nubra transmission line from three years to 18 months,” he added.The governor and the Union minister inaugurated 15 power projects in Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh and laid the foundation stone for another 20 projects in these regions of the state that was bifurcated into two union territories on August 5.#WATCH J&K Governor:Hamare bahaut saare mantri jinko kai bar mauka nahi milta, antarashtriya mamlon pe bolne ka vo PoK pe chadhai kiye hue hain ki vo next target hai.Main kehta hoon agar next target PoK hai toh hum ladai ki bajaye J&K ki taraqqi ke adhaar pe usko le sakte hain… pic.twitter.com/OQR8W11cwI— ANI (@ANI) September 18, 2019Singh, in his address, stressed that the power supply in this winter will be much better than in the past.“We will spend time in Jammu in December and January to experience and observe the situation … our goal is to provide 24 hours electricity supply to all the citizens of the country, including Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh,” he said.Singh said the regions have the potential to generate enough hydel power, not only be self-sufficient but also to export it to other states.“This will enhance the per capita income of the state like it did in Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand,” he added.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

897,Saudi displays evidence of attack by Iran on its oil plants,"Saudi Arabia on Wednesday displayed wreckage of drones and missiles it said were used in the attacks on two of its oil facilities, calling them ""undeniable"" evidence of Iran's involvement in the attacks. A total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks launched from Iran, Saudi Arabia said. Yemen-based Houthi rebels had claimed responsibility for the attacks.",RT,"Speaking to the press on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Saudi Ministry of Defense displayed what he said was wreckage from the projectiles used in the strikes on petrol plants in Abqaiq and Khurais last weekend.The type of weapons used proved that the assault “could not have originated in Yemen,” Colonel Turki al-Maliki claimed. He said the capabilities of the drones and the cruise missiles have been known to Riyadh from previous attacks.Accusing Iran of sponsoring the attack, the spokesman called on other countries to “acknowledge Iran's malign activities in the region.”The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran.He also presented surveillance footage from one of the oil facilities, claiming it depicted a drone in flight, though the UAV was difficult to make out in the video.It wasn’t clear where precisely the attack originated, al-Maliki admitted. He said the government was “working to know exactly the launch point.”The press conference came just as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Jeddah, where he is scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the attacks.Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the drone and missile strikes on Saturday, which caused a severe disruption in global oil markets and sent prices soaring upward by nearly 20 percent. The damaged refinery in Abqaiq was among the world’s largest oil processing facilities, while the Khurais plant sits on the country’s second largest oil field.The missile used in the attack could be a copy of the Soviet-designed cruise missile Kh-55, which Iran acquired from Ukraine and then developed into its own weapon, a military analyst and retired army officer Viktor Murakhovsky told RT.However, this does not qualify as definitive proof that Iran launched such an attack, Murakhovsky said. It is “hardly a secret” that Iran sells weapons to the Yemeni Houthi rebels, he explained, adding that Tehran has spoken in support of Yemen’s right of self-defense.Moreover, it is not difficult for Houthi forces to launch a cruise missile, so their responsibility cannot be ruled out.“You do not need a narrow-focus specialist in order to use this missile. You need to input the launch mission data and carry out the launch, that’s all,” Murakhovsky said.Doubling down on their claim of responsibility, the Houthis on Wednesday said that the strikes were launched from “three positions,” and added that the drones used would be “revealed today for the first time.”Meanwhile, Tehran officials have dismissed the arguments presented at the Saudi press-conference as inconclusive.The Saudi press conference was a “media disaster” for the country, said Hesameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, arguing the kingdom could not prove “what area and point [the strikes] were fired from,” or “why the air defense failed to thwart the attack.”Like this story?

O'Brien has been serving as the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the US' State Department. He will replace John Bolton, who was fired by Trump earlier this month.",RT,"Trump announced O’Brien’s nomination on Wednesday, saying that he has “worked long and hard with Robert.”I am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O’Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor. I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job!O’Brien replaces John Bolton, the hawkish interventionist sacked last week. Bolton was a proponent of military intervention in Iran, Venezuela, Syria, and North Korea, and Trump had reportedly complained that Bolton was actively trying to drag him into conflict. Announcing his dismissal, Trump said that he “strongly disagreed” with many of Bolton’s positions.O’Brien is a lesser known name in foreign policy circles, and is currently serving as the special envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department. Though more used to overseeing the release of hostages from conflict zones, O’Brien was sent by Trump to Sweden in July, to try to secure the release of rapper A$AP Rocky, who was jailed for an alleged assault in Stockholm.The negotiations failed, and Rocky was jailed before eventually being released pending a verdict.O’Brien set forth his foreign policy beliefs in his 2016 book ‘While America Slept.’ In it, he called for a strengthening of America’s military alliances, the relevance of which Trump has questioned in the past, and an aggressive posture against China.The diplomat also compared the Obama administration’s signing of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran to appeasing Nazi Germany. Given Trump’s promise on Wednesday to “substantially increase” sanctions on Tehran, O’Brien’s hiring likely signals no thaw in relations with the Islamic Republic.Subscribe to RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.",https://www.rt.com/news/469085-trump-names-robert-c-obrien/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Samsung Electronics shut its TV production unit in India last year and moved production to Vietnam because of the tax. The decision will provide relief to TV manufacturers, which have been hit by cheap imports from Vietnam, Panasonic India CEO Manish Sharma said.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has scrapped a tax on imports of open cell TV panels, used to make television displays, in a move likely to boost television manufacturing in the country and counter incentives offered by nations such as Vietnam. New Delhi had charged a 5% import tax on open cell TV panels, which was a factor in Samsung Electronics’ decision last year to shut its TV production unit in India and move production to Vietnam. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is keen to position India as an attractive electronics manufacturing destination at a time when growth in India has slowed sharply, and Washington and Beijing are engaged in a drawn out trade war. The dispute between the United States and China has led to higher tariffs on goods worth tens of billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, prompting companies to look at other countries to escape higher tariffs. Amid suggestions that India is late to capitalise on the trade war, ministries have been asked to submit policies and incentive structures to the country’s foreign investment promotion agency, Reuters has previously reported. Nine sectors including electronics, autos, pharmaceuticals and telecoms will be targeted. The move to scrap the tax on open cell panels is a step in the right direction, said Vikas Agarwal, the India head of OnePlus, a Chinese firm known for high-end Android smartphones. “TV is the next big focus for us. Any incentives or benefits are good for us,” said Agarwal, whose firm is seen making a foray into television sales in the country. The federal government’s decision would also provide respite to local TV manufacturers, which have been hit by cheap imports from Vietnam, said Manish Sharma, CEO of Panasonic India, the fourth biggest TV manufacturer in India. “The move will allow us to pass the (cost) benefits to the end-consumer, which would mean an about 3-4% reduction in price, thus providing the necessary thrust to the market,” he said.

Notably, Union Minister Santosh Gangwar had earlier said that there is no dearth of employment opportunities but north Indian candidates lack qualification.",The Financial Express,"Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday stepped up her attack on Modi government over rising unemployment in the country. She said that the BJP government starts looking the other way when it comes to providing jobs to the youngsters.She said that the potential and talent of youngsters can be used as an engine to drive the growth, but the government is in a regular habit of underestimating them. She said that when questions are asked, the government argues that north Indian youth don’t have merit.“There are two lakh vacancies of teachers in Uttar Pradesh. The youth are finding new avenues for jobs. They are protesting under the sun and in the rains. But when it comes to providing jobs, people in the BJP government look the other way or say that youth of north India do not possess adequate merit,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.Priyanka’s comments come in the backdrop of Union Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar’s Saturday statement that there was no dearth of employment opportunities in the country, but recruiters visiting north India complain of lack of ‘quality people’ to fill vacancies. The Bareilly MP, however, later clarified that he was only stressing on the lack of requisite skills among the youth and to address it, the Centre has set up the Skill Development Ministry.Earlier on Monday, Priyanka had posted a video of Gangwar making the remarks at a press conference in Bareilly. Besides, she had also demanded from the minister to release the figures of how many jobs have been given to north Indians in the last five years.Hitting out at the government over the state of the economy, she said that it can’t evade responsibility for the economic slowdown as people are watching. “One more company has suffered due to economic slowdown and people have lost their jobs,” Priyanka said as she referred to media reports claiming that automobile firm Mahindra will suspend production for 17 days.Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in a Muzaffarpur court against Gangwar for allegedly ‘insulting’ the people of north India. The petition was filed by social activist Tamanna Hashmi on Monday. Hashmi said that he has filed the petition under sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot), 195 (fabricating false evidence), 295 (insult the religion of any class) and 405 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code.

921,GST tax rate cuts for auto sector unlikely: Government,"The GST panel is unlikely to lower tax rates for the auto sector due to large revenue losses, government officials said. A government study said that the total annual revenue loss could be as much as $6.95 billion if the panel decided to decrease tax rates. The auto sector, however, has pushed to lower tax rates to 18% from 28%.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s goods and services tax (GST) panel is unlikely to approve lowering the tax for the auto and allied components sector this week, as a study has warned of major revenue losses, two government officials said. A government study, attached to the agenda of a Sept. 20 GST panel meeting, has said the total annual revenue loss could be as much as 500 billion rupees ($6.95 billion), if the panel decided to lower tax rates for the auto sector to 18% from 28%. Meanwhile, state officials in Kerala, Punjab and West Bengal say they are also opposed to any cut in tax rates in the autos sector, or even consumer goods, because of lacklustre tax collections this fiscal year. In the April-July period, total tax revenues of 20 Indian states fell 7% to 4.9 trillion rupees compared with the same period last year.  Some states were particularly hard hit, with data showing Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab tax collections plunged 59%, 35.5% and 12.5%, respectively.  “I will oppose any reduction for the simple reason that it won’t be revenue neutral,” said Thomas Isaac, finance minister of the southern state of Kerala. The auto sector, which has been reeling from the worst slump in nearly two decades, has pushed for a lowering of tax rates at the Sept. 20 GST panel meeting, in a bid to revive vehicle demand.  The GST panel is chaired by the federal finance minister and all state finance ministers are members. The panel makes decisions by vote. Still, those states ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party may be willing to support a GST cut if the federal government pushes such a proposal. “In my view, if the centre feels that it is good for the economy, and they will be able to compensate the states, then the states should support the proposal,” said Himanta Biswa Sarma, the finance minister of the northeastern state of Assam.  The GST meeting will be closely watched as it could help investors gauge the government’s seriousness in reviving growth in Asia’s third-largest economy. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has in recent weeks outlined a slew of measures to revive investor sentiment and push growth up from a 25-quarter low of 5% in April-June. But measures such as creating a stressed fund for the hard-hit housing sector, a withdrawal of higher taxes on foreign portfolio investors and planned mergers among state-owned banks have not really helped revive investor sentiment.  Weak growth has also hit the federal government’s direct tax collections, which are showing a 6% growth rate, considerably less than the budgeted 17% growth rate for this fiscal year, while GST collections in August fell to a six-month low. This, in turn, could make it challenging for the government to meet its fiscal deficit target of 3.3% for 2019/20.

However, the presence of Khalil, a PTI leader and founder of the terrorist organisation Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), in the event meant to garner support for Kashmir was questionable.India has long blamed Pakistan for fuelling terror and supporting terrorist groups in Jammu and Kashmir to create unrest in the region. Imran Khan's party, which rose to power with a promise to not provide safe haven to terrorists, has been often blamed for supporting terrorist groups. Khan has been infamous as Taliban Khan for his staunch support to the terrorist group. Khalil's organization HuM, is said to have been in direct contact with Osama Bin Laden and his family when he was in Abbottabad and has been on the US State department's foreign terrorist organization list since 1997. Khalil has been a strong supporter of Imran Khan and advocated for the latter's candidature as the Prime Minister of the country last year. In March, Khan government received a lot of backlash for including of Khahil into the party. The photo has emerged weeks before the crucial Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meeting where Pakistan's compliance with the action plan will be assessed and it fears blacklisting. Pakistan has been under the FATF radar for its complicity towards terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) among others. In addition, terrorists like Hafiz Saeed are regularly seen ranting anti-India rhetoric and collecting so-called donations.The FATF recently gave a stern message to Pakistan to expedite its action plan for curbing terror financing by October or face the prospect of getting blacklisted, which could aggravate problems for its stagnant economy.

The lawyer of the defendant who was found guilty of murder, had filed an appeal with the higher court, claiming the judge acted inappropriately during the trial.",Daily Mail,"A judge in Bermuda has been criticised by the British Court of Appeals for telling a murder trial he was getting 'horny' because of the amount of sex mentioned in the case.Carlisle Greaves, who served until last month as a junior judge in the British overseas territory, made the outrageous remark while a witness gave crucial evidence during the trial.The murder trial, which saw Khyri Smith-Williams convicted of slaying Colford Ferguson, was taken to the Court of Appeal when defense attorney Jerome Lynch demanded a retrial, claiming the judge had behaved inappropriately.Calisle Greaves, who served until last month as a junior judge in the British overseas territory, made the outrageous remark while a witness gave crucial evidence during the hearingThe Court of Appeal ultimately rejected the calls but Appeal judge Sir Maurice Kay said the court could not condone the lewd comments. Mr Justice Kay said: 'In particular, his comment ""all this sex is beginning to get me horny"" was inappropriate and inimical to the dignity of court proceedings. 'Mr Lynch was justified in criticising it. However, I do not believe that it damaged the defence or had the potential to undermine the safety of the conviction.'   Smith-Williams was sentenced to serve at least 35 years in prison last October, after he was found guilty of the murder by a majority verdict. Mr Ferguson, a 29-year-old father of one, was shot dead in February 2011, as he worked on a house in Somerset, Bermuda - which is a cluster of 181 islands in the North Atlantic usually referred to in the collective.Troy Harris, a witness for the Crown, told the court that Smith-Williams confessed his involvement in the killing to him and admitted that he had driven the getaway motorbike.He said Smith-Williams also told him that Rasheed Muhammad had pulled the trigger and that Mr. Ferguson was not the intended target.Smith-Williams launched an appeal against his conviction, which was heard in June.In the hearing, Mr Lynch criticised Mr Justice Greaves's handling of the case, particularly his behaviour during Mr Harris's evidence.He argued that the judge had done little to rein in the witness's use of vulgar language and that the 'tacit approval' of the behaviour had lent it credibility.In transcripts presented to the Court of Appeal, Mr Harris cursed repeatedly, called Mr Muhammad a f****t and made repeated references to 'f***ing p***y'.But the higher court found Mr Justice Greaves's response to the unsavoury language was not prejudicial.Mr Justice Kay wrote: 'Anybody familiar with serious criminal trials, in this jurisdiction in recent years, knows the judge has a very personal style, whereby he engages with witnesses, defendants, juries and advocates in an informal way, often using casual language and rich metaphors.'In relation to Harris, it was important that the judge should facilitate his evidence, whatever it turned out to be.'If he took the view, and I suspect he did, that the best course was to let the witness have his say, subject to the rules of evidence, rather than seek to inhibit him, it seems to me that that was an exercise of judgment which was open to him.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7470745/Bermuda-judge-slammed-British-Appeal-Court.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This comes after the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, which killed 51 people, was broadcasted live on Facebook.",Engadget,"Facebook will use footage from police body cameras to train its automatic detection systems to spot and remove footage of mass shootings. The company announced Tuesday that it will partner with law enforcement in the US and UK to obtain footage from their firearms training programs. Data from those videos should help Facebook's systems detect real-world, first-person footage of violent events.According to Financial Times, Facebook will provide the UK's Metropolitan Police with body cameras at no cost. In exchange, Facebook will have access to that data, which it will also share with the UK Home Office. The company is reportedly in talks with US law enforcement about a similar partnership.Facebook was criticized this spring when, after the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, footage from the attack was available on Facebook for weeks following the event. Part of the problem, Facebook said, is that it did not have enough content depicting first-person footage of violent events to train its machine learning technology. Facebook hopes footage from the police training programs will allow it to improve its automatic detection systems. By making those systems more accurate, Facebook may also reduce the likelihood that it will mistakenly remove violent scenes from fictional content, like movies or video games.Facebook says some of the changes it has made to combat hate and terrorism predate the Chirstchurch shooting. ""But that attack, and the global response to it in the form of the Christchurch Call to Action, has strongly influenced the recent updates to our policies and their enforcement,"" Facebook wrote in a press release.

As per a report, the youths were later detained. The incident comes amid DMK's announcement of a state-wide protest against Home Minister Amit Shah's remarks about Hindi being a ""unifying"" language.",Times Now,"Chennai: The debate over making Hindi a national language has taken a rather violent turn after several youth workers of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam defaced the name of a railway station that was written in Hindi in Tamil Nadu’s Gudiyattam area on Wednesday.DMK cadres were detained for blackening the Hindi text on the Gudiyattam railway station signage in Vellore district. The incident comes at a time when the DMK has announced a state-wide protest against Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s remarks about Hindi being a unifying language.In a video accessed by Times Now, several youths allegedly from the DMK can be seen holding ‘Get Out Hindhi’ placards and smearing the Hinti text of the signboard on the platform in black ink.Last Saturday, Amit Shah had said on the occasion of Hindi Diwas that a common language would be “the mark of India’s global identity” and expressed intention to make Hindi the national language. However, the Centre faced a lot of backlash from opposition parties and people from the southern part of India where Hindi is not a widely-spoken language.This drew the ire of the DMK-ruled Tamil Nadu government that announced state-wide protests on September 20 condemning the ‘Hindi imposition’. “This meet urges the Centre to give up the imposition of Hindi language immediately and engage itself in useful activities that will develop the nation,” the DMK said in a statement, according to news agency PTI.Former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, who is currently under trial and is lodged in the Tihar jail in the INX Media money laundering case, also voiced his displeasure with it and urged the people of Tamil Nadu to join the DMK in its protest.“A dangerous idea that Hindi alone can unite the people of this country has been floated. The Tamil people, as well as all others who speak other languages, will never allow the imposition of Hindi. We support the development of all languages, but we will never accept the idea that Hindi alone will unite the people of this country. I urge the TNCC president KS Alagiri to ask all Congress workers to join the state-wide protest announced by the DMK on 20.09.2019 to oppose the imposition of Hindi,” Chidambaram said in a tweet posted by his family from his official Twitter account.
I have asked my family to tweet on my behalf the following:

A dangerous idea that Hindi alone can unite the people of this country has been floated.

I urge the TNCC president @KS_Alagiri to ask all Congress workers to join the state-wide protest announced by the DMK on 20.09.2019 to oppose the imposition of Hindi.Earlier in the day, actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth, after Kamal Haasan, expressed their displeasure with the Home Minister’s remark to make Hindi a national language, with Rajinikanth saying that “no one will accept the imposition of Hindi, especially in Tamil Nadu and southern India”. “No Shah, Sultan or Samrat should renege on that promise. We respect all languages but our mother language will always be Tamil,” Kamal Haasan had said on Monday.“India is a country of different languages and every language has its own significance. But it is important to have a language for the whole country, which should become the identity of India in the world.

These companies start eating into workers' incomes to increase revenue once they have consolidated their market shares to some extent.“There have been many accounts from workers who have felt targeted by these platforms for having raised questions with them. Their IDs are suddenly blocked for no reason and they have to spend hours and sometimes days to have it sorted; some have witnessed a drastic reduction in the number of deliveries allotted to them soon after they raise a complaint or express disagreements over pay or orders. So, you see that algorithms are used to control, monitor and discipline workers,” she says.She added, “Workers often express feeling cheated regarding work conditions, which have an adverse effect on earnings.  In countries like Spain and UK, food delivery workers are fighting legal battles to have platforms recognise them as employees and are rejecting the label of ""partners"". In Spain, the workers have won the case for now.”Need for collectivisationPointing at the recent legislation passed by the US state of California, which makes it difficult to classify workers as ""independent contractors"", the All India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) has called for these workers to unionise.“These delivery partners are assumed to be ‘freelancers’. But they are not independent at all. Companies dodge themselves from providing minimum facilities that any employee can possess. They are pushed to long working hours and gruelling work conditions. There are strict control and supervision over the hours and location of their work and there is no job security. Along with that, there are regular variations in pay-out, delivery charges and incentives.

The US Navy refused to give details about the locations the videos were shot in.",RT,"Three widely-circulated clips depicting military aircraft interacting with UFOs – mysterious objects performing maneuvers not possible using existing aviation technology – were never supposed to be released to the public, the Navy’s Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare spokesman Joseph Gradisher told the Black Vault earlier this month, but the videos are genuine – and their contents can’t be explained.“The Navy designates the objects contained in these videos as unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAP), Gradisher said, explaining that UAP is used instead of UFO as the “basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges.”Translated into English: we don’t know what they are, but there’s no evidence they’re alien in origin.One clip (“FLIR1”) shows a dark, pill-shaped object hovering for several seconds before scooting sideways extremely fast. Another (“GoFast”) shows the observing aircraft’s sensor lock onto a fast-moving target as the pilots are heard in the background excitedly wondering what exactly they’ve stumbled across. The third (“Gimbal”) shows an oblong object moving steadily before stopping and rotating as the pilots observing it exclaim in surprise.The videos were released to Luis Elizondo – a former military intelligence officer who claims to have directed the Pentagon’s UFO research arm, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program – in 2017, for use in a database about aerial threats. While declassified, they were not cleared for general public use.Since then, the videos have made their way to the New York Times and To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, a consortium of former intelligence officers, scientists, and celebrities promoting the investigation of UFOs and other “scientific mysteries.” The Pentagon complained, stating earlier this year that the videos “should still be withheld” as they were “never officially released to the general public,” but it’s a bit too late to put the unidentified flying cat back in the bag.The Navy set up guidelines earlier this year for reporting “unidentified aircraft” entering US airspace, ensuring no encounter would go undocumented in response to a plethora of reports, and lawmakers have reportedly requested briefings on the issue as the Pentagon’s history of chasing UFOs under secretive programs like AATIP has become public knowledge.Think your friends would be interested?

Citing a ""person familiar with the matter,"" the publication says Juul wasn't told why its e-cigarettes and nicotine pods were removed from both physical and online stores, making it unclear whether the ongoing trade war between the US and China was a factor.It's safe to say, however, the setback comes at a time when Juul faces uncertain prospects in the US. Last week, the Trump administration announced it may ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes. Two states, New York and Michigan, have already enacted their own bans. At the same time, the company is the target of separate investigations by the House, Senate and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

978,Legalise betting to curb corruption in cricket: BCCI's ACU chief,"BCCI's Anti-Corruption Unit chief Ajit Singh Shekhawat has said that betting should be legalised to curb corruption in cricket. ""Legal betting will be done under some parameters and it can be controlled. It will also bring a huge amount of revenue for the government, close to what the excise department generates,"" he added.",Cricket Country,"The BCCI‘s Anti-Corruption Unit chief Ajit Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday suggested a match-fixing law, besides legalisation of betting, to tackle corruption in Indian cricket.ALSO READ: Committee appointed to enquire into reports of match-fixing in TNPLShekhawat, who was the Director General of Police in Rajasthan before taking charge of BCCI’s Anti-corruption Unit in April 2018, gave his suggestions in an interview to PTI. This was after 12 cricketers, including national and international, reported corrupt approaches in the last one year, the Tamil Nadu Premier League came under scanner for suspect activity and a woman cricketer reported an approach from a bookie.READ: TNPL match-fixing: Coach previously associated with IPL franchise and a Ranji team under scannerIn the light of cases emerging from the leagues of Mumbai, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu this year, has match-fixing or spot fixing become unstoppable in the country?“It is not unstoppable. We probably require a law against it, a match-fixing law. If there is a clear law against it, police will also have a clear cut role,” Shekhawat said.ALSO READ: Indian woman cricketer approached for match-fixing during England series, BCCI ACU files FIRLast year, the Law Commission of India had expressed the need to make match-fixing a criminal offence, like it is in England and Australia. Legalised betting is another way to deal with corruption in the game, explained Shekhawat.“May be there could be a thinking about legalising gambling so that all this illegal business which goes on can be controlled. Legal betting will be done under some parameters and it can be controlled,” he said. “It will also bring a huge amount of revenue for the government, close to what the excise department generates. The amount of money which is bet on sports is mindboggling.”He said a move like this would also help keep a tab on the people involved as well as the money.“Revenue is not the only consideration, there could be other issues which the government has in mind. I am not saying categorically that it should be legalised but it should be considered. It could be regulated when it is legalised, right now it is totally illegal.“Once it is legalised you will also get the data on who is betting and how much is he betting. And while doing that, make illegal betting tougher. Right now you can get away with a fine of few hundreds or a few thousands,” he said.Men’s cricket has been prone to corruption for long but now even the women’s game is not immune to the menace. In February, an India women’s cricketer reported a corrupt approach to the BCCI, prompting the ICC to conduct an inquiry. On Monday, an FIR was lodged against two individuals in the matter.“Anything which is given wide publicity, which is telecast live, it lends itself to betting and once something lends itself to betting then it could be anything. If they find out that it is getting tough to make headway in men’s cricket, they may try to go to women’s cricket,” he pointed out.“If that is also tough, they may try the state leagues and if that is also proving to be tough, they may they have their own league like it was in the case of Rajputana league.”Since Shekhawat took charge, the BCCI ACU has witnessed some wholesale changes in its functioning. The department has more staff now, eight personnel to be precise, and it plans to recruit 5-6 more in the near future.“This is the first time we have totally taken over the anti-corruption of the state run leagues. It is also the first time our officials are staying at the team hotels to keep a watch on the players.“We also organise anti-corruption classes for the participants. We tell them what anti-corruption code is, what the penalties are and what are the responsibilities cast upon each of the participants,” he explained. “Like when an approach is made, it is incumbent upon the participant to report it. If he doesn’t report it, it is an offence and he could be penalised. Due to anti-corruption classes, the players have started reporting approaches.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/betting-should-be-legalised-to-curb-corruption-in-indian-cricket-bccis-acu-chief-892392?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The CBI is looking for Rajeev Kumar in the Saradha chit fund case. On Tuesday, a district and sessions court had rejected Kumar's pre-arrest bail plea.",The Financial Express,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Tuesday took a dig at West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee who is slated to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi tomorrow. He claimed that the Trinamool Congress chief is meeting the PM in “a last-ditch effort” to save former Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar. The last time that both leaders had met was at a convocation ceremony at Shantiniketan’s Visva Bharati University on May 25 last year. During the general elections earlier this year, Banerjee had refused to meet Modi when the state was under cyclone threat saying she would meet the next PM after polls as elections were underway.Vijayvargiya said that Banerjee knew well that Kumar’s arrest would lead half of her ministers behind bars in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam. The TMC in its response to Vijayavargiya termed his claims as baseless, saying that the CM was within her rights to meet the Prime Minister to discuss issues related to development of the state.In recent times, a number of Trinamool leaders and former city top cop Rajeev Kumar have been under the scanner of the CBI in the Saradha scam. With Kumar still not ready to appear before the CBI, days after Calcutta High Court vacated its previous interim order that gave Kumar protection from arrest in the case, the CBI has moved a Basirhat court seeking a non-bailable warrant against him. Currently serving as West Bengal CID Additional Director General, Kumar was part of a Special Investigation Team that was formed by the state government to probe the scam, before the case was handed over to the CBI in 2014.The Saradha group allegedly duped lakhs of people of close to Rs 2500 crore, promising a higher return on investing.Also read: Mamata Banerjee describes her scheduled meeting with PM Modi as ‘courtesy’ one; says will focus on issues related to WBThe CBI’s attempts to question Rajeev Kumar have previously resulted in a major political battle between the Centre and the TMC.

Some of the sleuths were taken into custody as they had allegedly come without proper documents. However, they were soon let off.

He added that state oil giant Aramco had emerged ""like a phoenix from the ashes"". Aramco shut down 5.7 million barrels per day of oil output, which is over half of Saudi's production.",Reuters,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will restore its lost oil production by the end of September and has managed to recover supplies to customers to the levels they were at prior to weekend attacks on its facilities by drawing from its huge oil inventories.  Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that average oil production in September and October would be 9.89 million barrels per day and that the world’s top oil exporter would ensure full oil supply commitments to its customers this month. “Over the past two days we have contained the damage and restored more than half of the production that was down as a result of the terrorist attack,” Prince Abdulaziz told a news conference in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. He said the kingdom would achieve 11 million bpd capacity by end of September and 12 million bpd by end of November.  “Oil supplies will be returned to the market as they were before 3:43 a.m. Saturday,” he said, adding that state oil giant Aramco had emerged “like a phoenix from the ashes” after the attack. He was referring to attacks on Saturday on state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco’s plants in Abqaiq and Khurais, including the world’s largest oil processing facility, which shut down 5.7 million barrels per day, which is more than half of Saudi Arabia’s production, or 5% of global output. Aramco’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser said the company, which is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), was still in the process of estimating repair work but that it was “not that significant,” given the company’s size. “We should be at our production (level) before the attacks on our facility by the end of September,” Nasser told the same news conference.  Aramco had put out 10 fires in the span of seven hours after the “huge” assault, Nasser said. He said the company was in the process of bringing back oil refining to full capacity and that there were enough crude products to supply the local markets. Aramco’s crude oil inventories are more than 60 million barrels, he said. Speaking at the same news conference, Aramco’s Chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan, said Aramco’s IPO would be ready within the coming 12 months and that the kingdom was committed to the listing. Rumayyan said the IPO would “continue as it is” despite weekend attacks and that timing would depend on market conditions. Prince Abdulaziz said Riyadh did not yet know who carried out the strikes or why, adding Saudi Arabia would keep its role as a secure supplier of global markets. He said stricter measures needed to be taken to prevent further attacks, but did not elaborate. The foreign ministry has said that preliminary investigations indicated Iranian weapons were used in the assault, which authorities initially said involved drones.

1006,Facebook to form content Oversight Board that can overrule CEO Mark,"Facebook has unveiled its plans to form an independent content Oversight Board comprising 40 people globally. The new rules will let users appeal content decisions directly to the board instead of through Facebook's usual channels. ""The board's decision will be binding, even if I or anyone at Facebook disagrees with it,"" Facebook Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.",Engadget,"Facebook has unveiled the finished charter for its content oversight board, and it's evident that the social site wants to give the board at least some meaningful independence.  The new rules will let users appeal content decisions directly to the board instead of through Facebook's usual channels, and any decisions will be binding no matter who at Facebook disagrees with it, according to Mark Zuckerberg.  The charter also outlines how Facebook intends to keep the board independent throughout the overall process, and how it will choose and work on cases.The board will be chosen from qualified and vetted candidates ""outside of our normal channels,"" including through a recommendation portal that will let anyone suggest candidates.  There will also be an in-between trust that oversees pay and other day-to-day operations.  You'll see at least 11 members (Facebook wants 40) with each serving a maximum of three terms of three years apiece.  They'll be chosen on a range of criteria that includes not just relevant experience, but open-mindedness and impartiality.  It wants people from a wide range of cultural, political and religious backgrounds.The board will have a specific process for handling cases.  A rotating case selection committee will choose cases to recommend, with at least one of them from the region where the complaint came from.  The board will choose the cases themselves, but general staff will choose the panel and case manager.  It'll be up to the board and its staff to determine if more research is needed.  Facebook will just be there to supply information when requested.  Draft decisions from the panel will be circulated to the whole board, which can call for a fresh review if a majority objects to the outcome.All decisions will go into a database that will serve as precedent for future decisions, much like traditional court systems.The oversight board won't hear cases until the first half of 2020, although you should hear about its first members before 2019 is over.If all goes according to plan, the board should help Facebook settle disputes over controversial decisions in a more educated and objective fashion.  As TechCrunch mentioned, though, this could also help Facebook's leadership wash its hands of responsibility if a decision proves unpopular or leads to regulatory trouble -- don't blame us, it's the board's fault.  Facebook can also decide just how broadly to apply the precedents set by case decisions, so the outcome may not always sync with expectations.  Even so, it's a start that could help it address the many, many disputes that have come up over the years.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/facebook-content-oversight-board-charter/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Previously parents could ask religious courts or officials to authorise the marriages of girls aged below 16. One in four girls in Indonesia is married before they turn 18, according to Indonesia's Statistics Agency and UNICEF.",Reuters,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s parliament has revised the country’s marriage law to  lift the minimum age at which women can marry by three years to 19, a move welcomed by campaigners as a step towards curbing child marriage in the world’s biggest Muslim majority-country. All factions in parliament agreed the revision at a plenary session on Monday, according to a statement on its website.  Indonesia is among the 10 countries in the world with the highest number of child brides, according to campaign group Girls Not Brides. One in four girls in Indonesia is married before they turn 18, according to a 2016 report by Indonesia’s Statistics Agency and the United Nations children’s fund UNICEF.  “The society still encourages girls to get married in their teenage years, otherwise they will be considered spinsters,” said Masruchah of the National Commission on Violence Against Women. Masruchah, who uses one name, said the commission would have preferred 21 as the minimum age for marriage for men and women, when both are considered mature in terms of reproduction and economic stability. Indonesia previously allowed girls of 16 to get married or younger — with no minimum age — if their parents requested it.  Indonesia’s Constitutional Court ruled in December that it was discriminatory to have a lower marriage age for women than for men, who could legally marry at 19. Child marriage in Indonesia has been blamed for causing maternal and infant deaths, as well as encouraging child labour, Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection Minister Yohana Yembise said in a statement. “Finally, after 45 years (of the existing marriage law). This is a present for Indonesian children,” she said.

The 42-year-old represented India in 57 ODIs from 2001 to 2007 and was also part of India's first-ever T20I. Mongia last represented his domestic side Punjab in 2007 before joining the now-defunct Indian Cricket League.",CricTracker,"Former India batsman Dinesh Mongia has called time on his cricket career on September 17, 2019. Mongia is best remembered for being picked over VVS Laxman in the Indian squad for the ICC World Cup 2003 in South Africa, where the Men in Blue ended up as runners-up, after being defeated by Australia in the finals.Mongia, who hailed from Punjab, made his debut for the state in 1995-96, was a prolific run-getter in the domestic circuit. The left-handed batsman was also a capable left-arm spinner who plied his trade effectively in the English county cricket as well, where he was signed by Lancashire in 2004 in place of Stuart Law and then in 2005, Leicestershire signed him for a full-time contract. He has also made appearances for the Lashings XI team as well.AdvertisementDinesh Mongia made 8028 runs in 121 FC matches at an average of 48.95 and the best score of 308* with 27 centuries and 28 half-centuries. He amassed 5535 runs in 198 List-A games with 10 centuries and 26 fifties. He made his India debut in 2001 in Pune ODI against Australia but came into prominence for his 159* against Zimbabwe in just 147 balls.Kinks in his technique were exposed on tours to New Zealand and England and after a below-par performance in the 2003 World Cup, he was dropped from the team in 2005, with his last match coming against Bangladesh in 2007. He also appeared in India’s first-ever T20I match against South Africa in 2006. He played 57 ODIs making 1230 runs with one century and in the sole T20I, he made 38 runs.However, his connection with the much-maligned Indian Cricket League (ICL), left him without much support once BCCI managed to force the unsanctioned league to draw its curtains down. “Those were hard days,” recalled Mongia, who was quoted as saying by The Hindu. Most players banned by the Board for their association with the ICL were granted amnesty but Mongia remained the lone cricketer who was kept out of the official circuit.However, he was made a State selector by the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) last season, which he sees as amnesty from BCCI and is looking forward to taking up coaching assignments.",https://www.crictracker.com/former-india-all-rounder-dinesh-mongia-announces-retirement-from-all-forms-of-cricket/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It said the move may have favoured Amazon's own brands to appear in the product search, adding that the algorithm was modified late last year. However, Amazon denied any such change to the algorithm to favour profitability or own products.",Engadget,"Amazon reportedly tweaked its product-search algorithm to favor products that are more profitable to the company. People who worked on the algorithm say the change could give Amazon's own brands a boost, The Wall Street Journal reports. If Amazon is intentionally using search to promote its own goods, it will likely draw more criticism from antitrust regulators.WSJ sources said the algorithm was modified late last year, and that the unpublicized change was contested internally. The move supposedly pitted Amazon's Seattle-based retail business and its Palo Alto, California-based search team (referred to as A9) against each other. Several A9 employees say the retail team pressured them to surface Amazon products higher in the search results. To make things more complicated, the two teams used to report to separate CEOs, but both now report to retail chief Doug Herrington.Amazon denies that it changed its search to factor in profitability or that it changed the way it ranked search results to favor its products. ""As any store would do, we consider the profitability of the products we list and feature on the site, but it is just one metric and not in any way a key driver of what we show customers,"" a company spokeswoman said in an email to Engadget.But promoting products that are more profitable could push customers towards Amazon's in-house products. Though, the search algorithm still takes other factors into consideration, and in some cases, third-party and brand-name products may still be more profitable for Amazon than its own products.The news will likely raise concern among politicians and regulators. Amazon -- along with Apple, Facebook and Google -- is already being investigated as part of a federal antitrust probe. Apple recently tweaked its App Store search algorithm so that its apps weren't always ranked first, and the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for manipulating search results to promote its own products.

London's share of daily volumes rose to 43% from 37%, while the US' share shrank to 17% from 20%. The dollar remained the most dominant currency and was on one side of 88% of all trades.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global daily currency turnover surged to a record $6.6 trillion, with London shrugging off Brexit uncertainty to extend its lead as the world’s dominant trading hub, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said on Monday. Foreign exchange markets had been shrinking when the BIS released its last triennial forex survey - considered the most comprehensive take on what is the world’s largest financial market - in 2016 as banks and hedge funds pulled back from trading. The latest edition, however, shows the market has bounced back with a hefty 29% jump in daily trading volumes from the $5.1 trillion recorded in 2016, lifted by huge growth in FX swaps activity, the rise of new proprietary and high-speed trading firms and more demand for emerging market currencies. But the topline increase in daily global FX turnover hides growing headwinds facing the industry. Among them is the rise of FX swaps used by banks and investors to hedge their currency exposure and which typically generate less revenue than plain old cash trading or highly complex and structured deals.  The survey by the BIS, a central bank umbrella group, showed that spot, or cash, volumes continued to decline, slipping to 30% of all daily volumes from a peak of 38% in 2013. FX swaps, meanwhile, gained market share and totalled 49% of all volumes in April 2019, up from 47% in the previous survey. “Growth of FX derivatives trading, especially in FX swaps, outpaced that of spot trading,” the BIS said.  Graphic: OTC foreign exchange turnover, here The BIS collated the data from volumes reported in April by nearly 1,300 financial institutions across 53 jurisdictions.  In a separate survey, the BIS said the market for over-the-counter interest rate derivatives more than doubled to $6.5 trillion from $2.7 trillion in 2016, driven mainly “by increased hedging and positioning amid shifting prospects for growth and monetary policy”.  The BIS said improved reporting contributed to the rise. Britain recorded the biggest share of daily turnover, accounting for $1 in every $2 of interest rate derivatives traded. The survey also showed the United Kingdom extending its dominance of the FX trading industry, defying sceptics who had predicted Britain’s 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union would damage London’s financial services sector.  Foreign exchange is the crown jewel of London’s financial sector. Industry experts say the city’s convenient time zone and its grip on FX trading infrastructure and personnel mean the sector could emerge unscathed from all the Brexit uncertainty. The BIS said London’s share of daily volumes rose to 43%, up from 37% in 2016, while the United States’ share shrank to 17% from 20%. In Asia, growing volumes in Hong Kong offset weakness in Singapore and Tokyo. “This is testament to London’s long-standing global trading relationships, concentration of counterparties and continued investment in technology infrastructure,” said Dan Marcus, CEO of ParFX, an electronic spot FX trading platform.  “From a foreign exchange perspective, there is no doubt that London remains a global centre of excellence.”     Notably, mainland China registered an 87% increase in trading activity to become the eighth-largest forex trading centre, up from 13th in 2016. The dollar .DXY remained the world’s most dominant currency and was on one side of 88% of all trades. There was little change in the ranking of the major currencies and market shares, though lower volatility in dollar-yen JPY= trading led to a drop of 5 percentage points in the Japanese yen's share to 17%, keeping it in third place behind the euro. Graphic: Currency distribution of OTC FX turnover, here Sterling's GBP= share stood at 13%, unchanged from three years earlier despite prolonged bouts of Brexit-induced volatility, remaining ahead of the Australian AUD= and Canadian dollars CAD=. Emerging market currencies raised their share to 25%, up from 21% in 2016. The growth came from a jump in Hong Kong dollar trading HKD=, as well as in the Korean won KRW=, Indian rupee INR= and Indonesian rupiah IDR=, the BIS said. Despite Beijing's push to broaden international use of the Chinese currency in recent years, the survey showed the yuan CNY= rising in line with overall market growth, leaving it with a 4.3% market share behind the Swiss franc CHF=.   The Mexican peso MXN= and Turkish lira TRY= - the latter suffering a currency crisis in 2018 - dropped in the rankings. Banks trading with “other financial institutions” - including nonreporting banks, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, institutional investors and official sector financial institutions - grew significantly to $3.6 trillion, 55% of the global total, BIS said. That included growing activity by smaller regional banks - reflecting their strength in FX swap activity - and hedge funds. Institutional investor participation, however, declined to 12% of global FX turnover from 16% three years earlier.

Archer picked up 22 wickets in the recently-concluded Ashes 2019.",Cricket Country,"England captain Joe Root has advised the team management not to exert too much pressure on “special” talent Jofra Archer. The Barbados-born pacer has been impressive since making his international bow at the beginning this summer.The 24-year-old took 20 wickets and bowled the Super Over in the final as England won the World Cup. He pocketed 22 wickets and rattled the likes of Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne and Matthew Wade in the Ashes 2019 as the series ended in a 2-2 draw. His 22 wickets included two six-wicket hauls.“When I faced him in the nets against the red ball it was pretty clear he’d be something special,” Root was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.READ: It meant a lot to have that reception from the crowd today, says Steve Smith“At times he might not always bowl at 90mph, but he will still go at 2.5 an over and create chances. Making sure we don’t expect him to average 12 over the next two-and-a-half years is important, but knowing he’s got that ability to turn a game on his own is exciting.“One thing we can expect is he’s going entertain and he’s going to make things happen. He’s come in and been fantastic. He has a way of having a huge impact on the game. His spell [against Wade at The Oval] – you saw the way he changed the whole atmosphere at the ground.“For someone right at the beginning of their career to have such a gift, it’s great to be able to captain that. I am very much looking forward to the rest of his journey.ALSO READ: England, Australia draw Ashes for the first time in 47 years“We’ve got to be careful not to expect too much of him.

The series has an 'apocalyptic' storyline with a 'relationship subplot'. It was filmed in Mexico City in late August and the post-production is reportedly underway.",Reuters,"MEXICO CITY / NEW YORK (Reuters) - Popular dating app Tinder has wrapped filming on its first television series, as owner Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) seeks to dive deeper into creating original content, people with direct knowledge of the project told Reuters. Making new shows is part of a larger strategy that will be revealed in the near future, a spokeswoman told Reuters, declining to elaborate on the plans. The source familiar with the production said it is Tinder’s first foray into creating an online platform for scripted video content. The multi-episode series centres on an “apocalyptic” storyline and includes a relationship sub plot but is not directly connected to Tinder’s core dating app business, the source said. It was filmed in Mexico City in late August. Tinder’s move should not be a big surprise given its ownership. Parent company Match is majority owned by IAC, founded by Hollywood legend and IAC (IAC.O) Chairman Barry Diller. Last October, Tinder launched a lifestyle website called Swipe Life to publish original content including articles and videos about dating and relationships.  Offering original content is an increasingly popular strategy for the mostly U.S.-based technology and retail industries that have already attracted millions of devoted users. Walmart Inc (WMT.N) is working with MGM to boost Walmart’s Vudu video service. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) has also considered video plans to keep customers interested in the brand. The strategy seeks to engage users on a deeper level even when they are not using the service. That could help Match hold on to its rapidly growing customers. Its shares have risen more than 75% this year as it continues to add subscribers.   Reuters reported in April that Airbnb Inc, the start-up for booking home rentals around the world, has ambitions to develop a slate of original shows to whet customers’ appetite for travel. For several years, Airbnb has considered various ideas for creating or licensing mini-series and documentaries about travel, and shows featuring Airbnb homes, guests and hosts, according to the Reuters story.

So, it is a kind request to the media to kindly not to share whatever they hear. It is unfair towards me, to say the least, and also not appropriate towards any party,” said Matondkar in a statement.Matondkar's statement comes in the wake of a report which alleged that she recently held a meeting with the personal assistant of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.Ruling out speculations, Matondkar said her talks with Milind Narvekar was just a “courtesy meeting”.Matondkar had joined the Congress on March 27 and contested the Lok Sabha Elections from Mumbai North constituency. However, she faced defeat at the hands of sitting Bharatiya Janata Party MP Gopal Shetty.Last week, Urmila Matondkar took everyone by surprise when she suddenly snapped her ties with the Congress, alleging 'betrayal' by the party. She has, however, stayed mum on her future course of political action. ""I hereby resign from the Indian National Congress (INC) as a member and from any post held in the INC.

'The Sun' published the story about murders of his half-brother and half-sister, titled 'Hero Ben's brother and sister were shot dead'. ""The decision to publish these details has...lifelong consequences for my mum,"" Stokes wrote.",CricTracker,"Ben Stokes had an amazing past two months as a cricketer as he helped England lift their maiden ODI World Cup trophy and then played an amazing inning in the Leeds Test against Australia, to help his team win the match and keep the Ashes 2019 alive. He was great with both the bat and ball. However, the all-rounder has come down heavily on irresponsible journalism of English daily newspaper The Sun.The Daily published an article which revealed sensitive information about the Kiwi-born cricketer’s family and their past which has a sad incident. The story deals with how Stokes’ sister and brother, Tracey, eight, and Andrew, four, were murdered by his mother’s ex before the birth of Ben. The England star and his family have never spoken about the incident publicly ever.AdvertisementBen’s mother Deb was previously married to Richard Dunn and when the two separated, Dunn was furious to know that Deb had gotten along with Rugby coach Gerard Stokes. He had the custody of Tracey and Andrew and shot them both dead before turning the gun on himself in April 1988. The Sun mentioned that the birth of Ben gave his mum “something to live fore”, as per family sources.However, Stokes has slammed the newspaper for invading their privacy by sending a reporter to his parents’ house in New Zealand and question them about this upsetting event in their life that they had forgotten about. “Today the Sun has seen fit to publish extremely painful, sensitive and personal details concerning events in the private lives of my family, going back more than 31 years,” Stokes posted on Twitter in a long statement which can be read below.“This is the lowest form of journalism, focussed only on chasing sales with absolutely no regard for the devastation caused to the lives as a consequence. It is totally out of order. The article also contains serious inaccuracies which have compounded the damage caused. We need to take a serious look at how we allow our press to behave. Despite the fact that this has now been made public, I do please ask all concerned to respect my family’s privacy and right to home life,” Stokes wrote on his Twitter handle.pic.twitter.com/ojjjvstZI2— Ben Stokes (@benstokes38) September 17, 2019 Stokes is currently on a break from cricket after helping England draw the Ashes 2019.

1085,Computer scientist who defended sex offender Epstein quits MIT,"Computer scientist and open software advocate Richard Stallman, who defended late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has resigned as a visiting scientist at MIT's research institute CSAIL. Stallman had described a victim of Epstein as ""entirely willing"". He had also allegedly called for legalising child pornography and abolishing age of consent laws on his personal blog over 15 years.",TechCrunch,"Computer scientist and open software advocate Richard Stallman said he has resigned from his position as a visiting scientist at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) after describing a victim of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein as “entirely willing” in emails sent to a department list. Stallman has also stepped down from his roles as president and board director at the Free Software Foundation, the nonprofit he founded in 1985.Last week, the Daily Beast reported that Stallman had also called for the legalization of child pornography and abolishment of age of consent laws on his personal blog in multiple posts published over the course of 15 years.In his MIT CSAIL resignation, also posted to his personal blog, Stallman wrote: “To the MIT Community, I am resigning effective immediately from my position in CSAIL at MIT. I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings.”MIT has been under scrutiny for its ties to Epstein, whom a New Yorker investigation found had secured $7.5 million in donations for the MIT Media Lab, far more than what was previously disclosed. As a result, its director, Joi Ito, resigned last week and MIT ordered an investigation into the Media Lab’s ties to Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell last month while awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges.As part of its preliminary findings, MIT president Rafael Reif admitted that the law firm conducting the investigation had uncovered a letter he wrote to thank Epstein for a donation in 2012, four years after Epstein had already pleaded guilty to procuring for prostitution a girl under 18. “I apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency,” Reif wrote. “Although I do not recall it, it does bear my signature.”Stallman’s emails were first made public last week by mechanical engineer and MIT alum Selam Jie Gano (the entire thread was later published by Vice). In an email sent to a MIT CSAIL mailing list earlier this month, Stallman wrote that Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s sex trafficking victims, who testified that she had been ordered to have sex with late MIT professor Marvin Minsky during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands when she was 17, had likely “presented herself to him as entirely willing.” He also wrote that “I’ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is absolutely wrong to use the term ‘sexual assault’ in an accusation.”Gano also published an email that Stallman sent to another CSAIL list that included undergraduate students. In it, he said “I think it is morally absurd to define ‘rape’ in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.”In response to a request for comment, an MIT CSAIL spokesperson forwarded TechCrunch a copy of the email CSAIL director Daniela Rus sent to the department informing them of Stallman’s resignation:Dear CSAIL colleagues,I am writing to let you know that today Richard Stallman submitted his resignation from the lab, effective immediately. In the weeks ahead, we will work with him to come up with a transition plan.We thank him for his technical contributions to the lab, to the free-software movement, and to the wider computer-science community over the decades.Recent events have also prompted me and other senior leadership at the lab to focus on having a discussion on how we can improve the ways we respectfully work with one another in this community. This includes ongoing conversations about the future of the CSAIL-related listserv.My team will continue to keep the community informed of our progress.Daniela Rus",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/computer-scientist-richard-stallman-who-defended-jeffrey-epstein-resigns-from-mit-csail-and-the-free-software-foundation/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The zebra also has an entirely black back and thin white stripes on its legs. It was reported that a 'stampede' was caused in the Maasai Mara National Reserve by the discovery as tourists and guides rushed to the park to observe the rare zebra.Melanism - the opposite of albinism - is caused by a build-up of dark pigmented melanin in the skin. The condition is hereditary and is caused by the mutation of genes. Melanism is found in various different species, including mammals, reptiles and amphibians. The black jaguar, for example, was once believed to be a separate species, but it was later found to be a melanistic version of a jaguar.A melanistic zebra is one whose white stripes haven't developed correctly on its skin. Pseudo-melanism, also called abundism, is a variant of the condition which causes large dark spots or stripes to appear across the skin. Source: ACMR  Parmale Lemein, a wildlife specialist at Matira Camp, told the Daily Nation there has never been any recorded case in the Maasai Mara of a zebra with such rare markings.He said melanistic zebras had, however, been spotted at other parks in Africa - none of which had survived six months.The photographs were also shared by well-known blogger Mutuma Untamed, who said the 'week old' foal had been named after the photographer who discovered it.On Facebook, he wrote: 'Did you know, last week a Maasai guide discovered a one of a kind hybrid baby zebra in the Maasai Mara.

1123,"I don't fear getting typecast, won't stop doing comedy: Varun","On being asked if he fears getting typecast, actor Varun Sharma said that he doesn't fear getting typecast and he won't stop doing comedy roles. ""Comedy is the genre that has given me an acceptance and... identity,"" he added. The actor further said that he likes to make people laugh and it's one of the toughest things to do.",Times Now," It was 2013 when actor Varun Sharma tickled the funny bone of the audience for the first time with his role of Choocha in his debut film Fukrey. Since then, he has never looked back and has managed to create a laugh riot in the theatres every time he appears on the screen.


Yet, from Fukrey onward, in films that followed including Dolly Ki Doli, Dilwale, Fukrey Returns, Arjun Patiala and his latest release Chhichhore, Varun has mostly donned the avatar of the goofy funnyman in his career spanning over six years. Does he he fear he could be getting typecast?

""In today's time it is a big task to be cast in good projects with good cast on a regular basis -- so typecasting comes much later. I enjoy comedy. I genuinely like to make people laugh. It is one of the toughest things to do,"" Varun said.

""Today, almost everyone is busy. Everyone is so occupied that they hardly get time to laugh their fullest. So, I feel blessed that through the medium of cinema, I can bring a smile on someone's face. Also, Comedy is the genre that has given me an acceptance and an identity. So, I don't fear of getting typecast and I won't stop doing comedy roles just because I have done too many,"" Varun told IANS.

The 29-year-old, however, feels it is important to explore other genres as well.

""I am not a comedian, I am an actor. So it is vital for me to become a versatile artiste who explores all kinds of roles and genres. I love crime, I love sci-fi -- and many other things. I want to showcase different shades to my fans. I really want to do a negative or a dark role,"" he said.

Varun is currently garnering a lot of praise for his role of Sexa, a sex-obsessed engineering student in Nitesh Tiwari's ""Chhichhore"". For him, it would be among his biggest achievements if fans now start calling him ""Sexa"", just as he has been ""Choocha"" to many fans for long.

""Recently I went to a Ganesh Chaturthi event and a fans came up to and addressed me as Sexa. It felt great! You know it's a beautiful feeling when an actor is called by his character's name. It rarerly happens that characters get embedded in the minds and hearts of the audience. Choocha was one such character -- it is a role close to my heart. I made my debut with it and I got so much love for it. I am glad that Sexa is matching that popularity. Within a short time, I have played two beautiful characters that are embedded in people's hearts. Touchwood, from Choocha to Sexa, it has been a great journey so far, and I hope for the best because there's still a long way to go,"" Varun added.",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/varun-sharma-reveals-that-he-genuinely-likes-to-make-people-laugh-calls-it-toughest-thing-to-do/489917?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The company said that current chief Cher Wang will step down while remaining chairperson of the company. Wang took over the position from Peter Chou back in 2015.HTC will continue to focus on VR and XR (extended reality), 5G and AI with Maitre at the helm. In the press release, Maitre said that HTC ""will set out immediately to continue the transition from building the worlds' best consumer hardware to also building complete services around them to make them easy to manage and deploy.""That likely means that HTC will continue to develop business services around the Vive VR headset, much like Microsoft did with Hololens.

Ghani was present at the time of the explosion but is safe and unharmed, his campaign spokesman Hamed Aziz said. Presidential elections in Afghanistan are scheduled to be held on September 28.",The Quint,"Separate attacks by suicide bombers – one targeting Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani's election rally and a second that ripped through the center of the Afghan capital – killed at least 48 people and wounded scores more on Tuesday, 17 September, in the deadliest single day since a peace agreement with Taliban insurgents was declared dead.In that explosion, 26 people were killed, according to Nasrat Rahimi, spokesperson for the Interior Ministry. Four among the dead were Afghan military personnel, he said. Another 42 people were wounded, many of them women and children.Also Read : Taliban Visits Moscow Days After Trump Kills Camp David TalksIn the second bombing, just hours later in the heart of Kabul not far from the US Embassy, the Taliban said they were targeting an Afghan army base. They killed 22 people, government officials said. Scores more were wounded.The violence comes as Afghanistan faces presidential elections on 28 September – a vote the Taliban vehemently oppose. The insurgent group has warned Afghans not to vote in the election and said their fighters would target election campaigns as well as polling stations.The bomber, who attacked Ghani's rally, detonated his explosives at the entrance to the rally, according to Hamed Aziz, a spokesperson from Ghani's campaign office. But Aziz said the explosion occurred some distance from where Ghani was addressing a crowd of about 2,200.Ghani condemned both attacks.There were many women and children among the casualties in the bombing near Ghani's rally, said Qasim Sangin, a local official.Local television footage of the attack showed twisted wreckage and charred remains of military and police vehicles that were apparently positioned near where the powerful blast occurred.Firdaus Faramarz, spokesperson for the Kabul police chief, said the attack in the heart of the Afghan capital took place near Massood Square, a deeply congested intersection in the centre of Kabul. NATO and US compounds are located nearby as are several Afghan government ministries.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, released a statement to the media saying Taliban suicide bombers were behind both attacks.In Parwan, Mujahid said the bomber targeted presidential guards who were protecting Ghani and the rally, along with other members of the security forces. Four military personnel were among the dead.Campaigning for the Afghan elections resumed last week after US President Donald Trump declared that the US-Taliban talks, which have been going on for months in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, are over.Most presidential candidates had suspended their campaigns while negotiations were taking place and as the US peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said a deal was all but signed.Ghani, who had been sidelined during much of the talks between Khalilzad and the Taliban, resumed campaigning immediately and had been steadfast in his demand that presidential polls should take place.Khalilzad and some of Ghani's rivals, however, had talked of establishing an interim administration to run the country while a peace deal was implemented.In the aftermath of the scrapped talks, Afghans braced for what many expected to be an increase in violence. The Taliban have refused to discuss a ceasefire and have stepped up attacks across the country.Meanwhile, Afghan forces backed by their US allies have intensified raids on militant hideouts in recent weeks.The Taliban have also refused to meet with representatives of Ghani's government for talks but it was two attacks in Kabul in recent weeks that caused Trump to halt the negotiations with the Taliban, including one that killed two NATO soldiers, one of whom was an American. Another US soldier died in combat in Afghanistan on Monday.Monday's death was the 17th US combat death in Afghanistan this year, according to the Pentagon's count. There also have been three non-combat deaths this year. More than 2,400 Americans have died in the nearly 18-year war.On Tuesday, the Afghan Taliban were in Iran visiting officials in Tehran, while last week they were in the Russian capital holding consultations with Zamir Kabulov, President Vladimir Putin's envoy for Afghanistan.Iran's semi-official Borna news agency on Tuesday quoted the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry there, Abbas Mousavi, as saying the Afghan delegation discussed ""the latest"" developments with Iranian officials.(Published in an arrangement with AP)(The Quint will no longer be on WhatsApp, owing to changes in its policies regarding news publishers.

1142,"WeWork may halt IPO over investors' valuation, governance concerns","Co-working space giant WeWork is expected to halt its Initial Public Offering (IPO), The Wall Street Journal reported. Investors reportedly raised questions on how much the company is worth and raised concerns about its corporate governance. Past reports had claimed that WeWork, last valued at about $47 billion in January, could seek a valuation as low as $15-18 billion.",TechCrunch,"The We Company, beleaguered parent of the short-term real estate property management and development company WeWork and other We-related subsidiaries, has issued a statement that says it “expects” to complete its initial public offering by the end of the year. The note all but confirms that the company is indeed delaying its IPO roadshow, which had been expected to commence this week.“The We Company  is looking forward to our upcoming IPO, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year,” the statement notes. “We want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment.”We’s plans for a $20 billion public offering have been hampered by questions about its corporate governance and the ultimate value of a company that private investors, through multiple rounds of funding, once thought was worth nearly $50 billion.But under the scrutinizing spotlight of the IPO process, investors have been publicly and privately balking at that sky-high valuation and the company’s questionable governance practices under chief executive officer and co-founder, Adam Neumann, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news that The We Company would put its offering on hold. Over the past few weeks, The We Company — which has expanded to include a boutique hotel operation, members-only financial services and a charter yacht service (!) — has made several moves to allay investors’ concerns. The company unwound some particularly egregious transactions with Neumann and added new directors. It also moved to limit Neumann’s power at the company.And last week, the company amended its prospectus to include the appointment of an independent lead director. It also slashed the strength of Class B and Class C shares so Neumann would not have 20 times the voting power of other shareholders, and removed Neumann’s wife from succession planning at the company. And then SoftBank, to shore up the IPO value, reportedly was prepared to buy at least $750 million in additional shares in the process.But eve all these drastic steps were not enough to comfort Wall Street investors. Not even the attempts to slash the company’s valuation to below $10 billion could attract enough investor interest to the public offering. And the opacity of The We Company’s reporting and metrics likely did nothing to help matters in the eyes of the investing public.Now, with the We Company delaying its listing, and with Uber and Lyft solidly underperforming in their first year as public companies, we may finally be reaching a long-awaited moment of reckoning.After years of rapid value growth in the tech world, spurred in part by venture capital firms placing sky-high valuations on their portfolio companies as ever-more cash was piled into them, perhaps the tsunami has finally hit land. If so, it’s not going to be pretty and there may be more to come. Perhaps it’s time to relearn the lesson that greed may not actually be good.WeWork and Uber are proof valuations are meaningless  ",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/the-we-company-reportedly-will-put-its-public-offering-on-hold/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The disqualification order states that the 17 MLAs cannot contest elections until the term of the Assembly is over. This means that the 17 rebels will have to wait for the upcoming Assembly polls in 2023.The MLAs are hoping for a favourable verdict as they want to contest the bye-elections in the 17 constituencies, which are due to be held within six months since the disqualification.If their disqualification is not set aside by the Supreme Court, then their prospects of getting inducted into Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa’s cabinet could be affected.  ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/sc-judge-recuses-himself-17-karnataka-mlas-disqualification-case-109029?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1151,Iran seizes vessel in Gulf for allegedly smuggling fuel to UAE,"Iran has seized a vessel in the Gulf for allegedly smuggling 2.5 lakh litres of diesel fuel to the UAE, a semi-official Iranian news agency said. The crew have been handed over to authorities in the Hormozgan province. Earlier this month, Iranian coast guards seized a vessel for smuggling fuel in the Gulf and detained its 12 Filipino crew members.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have seized a vessel in the Gulf for allegedly smuggling 250,000 litres of diesel fuel to the United Arab Emirates, Iran’s semi-official Students News agency ISNA reported on Monday. “It was detained near Iran’s Greater Tunb island in the Persian Gulf...the crew have been handed over to legal authorities in the southern Hormozgan province,” ISNA said,     without elaborating on the nationalities of the crewmen. The reported seizure coincided with raised international tensions following a weekend attack on a major oil installation in Saudi Arabia, Tehran’s longtime regional foe. Responsibility for the strike was claimed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, while the United States has blamed Iran itself for the strike. Iran denies the accusation.  Iran, which has some of the world’s cheapest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and the fall of its national currency, has been fighting rampant fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf Arab states.    Iran stepped up its fight against smuggling fuel earlier this month when its coast guards seized a vessel for smuggling fuel in the Gulf and detained its 12 Filipino crew members.  In July, Iran seized a British oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz for alleged marine violations, two weeks after British forces detained an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar accused of taking oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Iran’s Adrian Darya 1, formerly Grace 1, was released last month. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Monday that the British-flagged Steno Impero oil tanker will be released soon.  The latest reported ship seizure by Iran follows a series of incidents involving shipping in and near the Gulf after U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports took full effect in May. The incidents coincided with stepped up attacks by the Houthis on targets in Saudi Arabia.

1152,Trump says he doesn't want war after attacks on Saudi oil plants,"US President Donald Trump on Monday said it looked like Iran was behind the drone attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia, adding that he didn't want to go to war. This comes as the attacks sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict. Iran has rejected US accusations that it was behind the attacks.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia but stressed he did not want to go to war, as the attacks sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict. Iran has rejected U.S. charges it was behind the strikes on Saturday that damaged the world’s biggest crude-processing plant and triggered the largest jump in crude prices in decades.   Relations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear and ballistic programs. Washington also wants to pressure Tehran to end its support of regional proxy forces, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting Iran-backed Houthis for four years. The United States was still investigating if Iran was behind the Saudi strikes, Trump said, but “it’s certainly looking that way at this moment”. Trump, who has spent much of his presidency trying to disentangle the United States from wars he inherited, made clear, however, he was not going to rush into a new conflict on behalf of Saudi Arabia. “I’m somebody that would like not to have war,” Trump said.  Several U.S. Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have blamed Tehran for the strikes. Pompeo and others will travel to Saudi Arabia soon, Trump said. A day after saying the United States was “locked and loaded” to respond to the incident, Trump said on Monday there was “no rush” to do so. “We have a lot of options but I’m not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this,” he said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the strikes were carried out by “Yemeni people” retaliating for attacks by a Saudi-led military coalition in a war with the Houthi movement. “Yemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defense,” Rouhani told reporters during a visit to Ankara. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi called the allegations “unacceptable and entirely baseless.” The attacks cut 5% of world crude oil production. Oil prices surged by as much as 19% after the incidents, the biggest intraday jump since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. Prices retreated from their peak after Trump said he would release U.S. emergency supplies and producers said there were enough stocks globally to make up for the shortfall. Japan said it will consider coordinated release of its oil reserves and other measures if needed to ensure sufficient supplies in the wake of the attacks. Crude prices were down around 1% in Asian trade on Tuesday. “The question is how long it takes for the supply to get back online,” said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. “However, the (geopolitical) risk premium ... which has been basically ignored by markets in favor of growth worries in recent months, is likely to be priced in going forward,” she said. Saudi Arabia said the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons and urged U.N. experts to help investigate the raid. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iranian threats were not only directed against the kingdom but against the Middle East and the world. While the prince did not directly accuse Tehran, a Foreign Ministry statement reported him as calling on the international community to condemn whoever was behind the strike. “The kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks,” the statement added. Saudi Arabia and Iran have been enemies for decades and are fighting a number of proxy wars. Trump said he had not made commitments to protect the Saudis.  “No, I haven’t promised Saudis that. We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out,” he said. “That was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn’t an attack on us. But we would certainly help them.”  Two sources briefed on state oil company Saudi Aramco’s operations told Reuters it might take months for Saudi oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks. Saudi Arabia said it would be able to meet oil customers’ demand from its ample storage, although some deliveries had been disrupted. At least 11 supertankers were waiting to load oil cargoes from Saudi ports, ship tracking data showed on Monday. Graphic for attacks on Saudi oil: here Tension in the oil-producing Gulf region has dramatically escalated this year after Trump imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its oil exports altogether. For months, Iranian officials have issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran is blocked from exporting oil, other countries will not be able to do so either. But Iran has denied a role in specific attacks, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and previous strikes claimed by the Houthis. Trump has said the goal from his “maximum pressure” approach is to force Iran to negotiate a tougher agreement and has left open the possibility of talks with Rouhani at an upcoming U.N. meeting. Iran says there can be no talks until Washington lifts sanctions.      U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council on Monday it was “not entirely clear” who was behind the strike but he said it had increased the chances of a regional conflict. But the U.S. ambassador to the world body, Kelly Craft, said  emerging information on the attacks “indicates that responsibility lies with Iran” and there is no evidence it came from Yemen. Iran’s Yemeni allies have promised more strikes to come. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group carried out Saturday’s predawn attack with drones, including some powered by jet engines. “We assure the Saudi regime that our long arm can reach any place we choose and at the time of our choosing,” Sarea tweeted. “We warn companies and foreigners against being near the plants that we struck because they are still in our sights.” U.S. officials say they believe the attacks came from the opposite direction, possibly from Iran itself rather than Yemen, and may have involved cruise missiles. Wherever the attacks were launched, however, they believe Iran is to blame. The attacks have raised questions about how Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s top spenders on weaponry, much of it supplied by U.S. companies, was unable to protect oil plants from attack. Sensing a commercial opening, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to help Saudi Arabia by providing Russian-made air defense systems to protect Saudi infrastructure. Russia and China said it was wrong to jump to conclusions about who was to blame for the attack on Saudi Arabia.

1154,Current account under threat if oil price surge continues: RBI,"India's current account and fiscal deficit could take a hit if oil prices continue to rise after the attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Monday. ""We should allow a few more days...before taking a final view,"" he added. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer, depends on imports for about 85% of its oil needs.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s current account and fiscal deficit could take a hit if  oil prices continue to rise after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend, the central bank chief said on Monday.  “We should allow a few more days to see how the situation plays out before taking a final view...depending on how long it persists it will have some impact on the current account deficit and further perhaps on the fiscal deficit if it lasts longer,” Governor Shaktikanta Das told the CNBC-TV18 news channel. Das said it was important to see whether alternative sources of supply come up and how soon the installations take to resume operation. U.S. officials blamed Iran for the attack, which damaged the world’s biggest crude oil processing plant and led to a 19% surge in oil prices. Iran denied blame and said it was ready for “full-fledged war”. A jump in oil prices is a negative for emerging markets such as India, which is the world’s third-biggest importer of oil. The country’s current account deficit in the March quarter narrowed on the back of the merchandise trade deficit contraction but a surge in crude prices could balloon the deficit and wreck havoc with the currency. The partially convertible rupee dropped nearly 1% on Monday to 71.60 per dollar versus its previous close of 70.92. India is also likely to miss its fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, despite receiving an additional dividend from the central bank, five government officials and advisers told Reuters earlier this month, as tax collections have sunk amid a sharp economic slowdown. Das said the monetary policy committee would continue to focus on growth with inflation expected to stay within the medium term target. Asia’s third largest economy expanded just 5.0% year on year in the June quarter, its weakest pace since 2013, far below the median forecast of 5.7%. “The numbers definitely look much worse. The number of 5% is a surprise. We are analysing why exactly it has happened,” Das told CNBC TV18. “Growth now is a matter of highest priority, especially with inflation remaining within 4%,” he added. The retail inflation rate rose to a 10-month high in August but stayed below the central bank’s 4% medium-term target. Analysts believe the slowdown could persist for two or three years while structural reforms are put in place. A Reuters poll conducted after the last monetary policy decision in August predicted the RBI would cut rates by another 25 basis points at its October review and then by 15 basis points early next year.

The move by the American technology giant comes amid the trade war between the US and China, which could result in Apple being forced to hike prices. A past report had claimed that Apple is planning to expand production to Vietnam alongside India.",BGR,"Apple is reportedly investing $1 billion to expand local manufacturing of iPhones in India. The move is seen as the way to look beyond China for assembly of iPhone. It is being described as part of Apple‘s plan to export ‘Made in India’ iPhones across the world. The details arrive amidst the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The iPhone maker is expected to become a victim soon forcing it to increase the price of iPhone around the world.Earlier, reports claimed that Apple is looking to expand production to Vietnam and India to thwart effects of trade war. Now, an unofficial source has told the Times of India that the Cupertino, California-based company is investing $1 billion through its partners. “They have said the production will be used for meeting the demand for its products across global markets.” Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn is said to be the investment partner in Apple’s push to assemble iPhone in the country.Apple Watch Series 3 gets a price cut in India; now starts from Rs 20,900Foxconn will use its facility in Chennai to manufacture products for Apple’s global markets.

1169,'Pedo guy' common insult when I was growing up: Elon Musk to court,"Founder of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk argued in court that his tweet calling British diver Vernon Unsworth a 'pedo guy' was meant to be an insult and not an accusation. ""Pedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up,"" Musk argued. Unsworth had helped rescue 12 boys from a Thai cave last year.",Engadget,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't believe his use of the term of ""pedo guy"" was an actual accusation of pedophilia. Lawyers for Musk in a court filing today argued that the missive, which Musk directed at a British diver last year and has made the South African billionaire the target of a defamation lawsuit, is actually a common insult from his childhood.""By referring to Mr. Unsworth as 'pedo guy,' I did not intend to convey any facts or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia,"" Musk said in a court filing Monday. ""Pedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up. It is synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of pedophilia."" Musk followed up his original tweet with another tweet that read, ""bet you a signed dollar it's true.""Shortly after he sent his tweets, Musk paid a private investigator $50,000 to investigate the British diver in question, Vernon Unsworth. The investigator claimed to unearth a series of salacious details about Unsworth's life, including telling Musk that he was a regular at Pattaya Beach -- a region in Thailand known for sex trafficking -- and married his wife when she was a teenager. Unsworth's 40-year old wife has since disputed the claims, saying that the couple has been married for seven years.Musk's lawyers are arguing that that there is no evidence to prove that he genuinely believed Unsworth to be a pedophile. ""There is no evidence that Mr Musk intended or believed that his July 15 tweets, that Mr Unsworth was 'sus' or 'pedo guy', would be interpreted as fact,"" the filing said. ""To the contrary, the evidence is that Mr Musk believed and intended his statements to be read as what they were: bare insults.""The complaint was filed in the US District Court of the Central District of California. The first hearing will be on October 28th and the trial will occur on December 2nd; both in Los Angeles. Musk last year asked the judge to toss out the lawsuit, labeling it a ""schoolyard spat"".",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/16/elon-musk-pedo-guy-tweet/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He will invest the rest $500 million in the startup.,Entrackr,"OYO’s founder Ritesh Agarwal ambitious $1.5 billion stock buyback plan has got a green signal from the Competition Commission of India (CCI).The approval will allow OYO’s founder to facilitate a transaction through freshly formed Cayman-based RA Hospitality Holdings, explicitly devised to facilitate this primary and secondary transaction on behalf of Agarwal.The transaction would take the valuation of OYO to $10 billion, whereas Agarwal current 9% stake would increase to over 30%.“The company will get an additional primary infusion of approximately $1.5 billion to support our mission,” an ET report quoted Agarwal as saying after getting the approval.He further added that the transaction would help OYO maintaining its leadership position in India and other overseas markets including Southeast Asai, Middle East, US and Europe.The stock buyback plan will also give the biggest cashout to venture funds Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital.Lightspeed, which holds around 13% stake (for $20 million investment) in OYO, is set to make around $1 billion from the sale of its half stake.

1173,Boat was pulled into whirlpool: Survivors recall Godavari boat tragedy,"Recalling the Godavari boat tragedy on Sunday, in which at least 11 people were killed and around 24 are missing, survivor Jyoti Babu said, ""The boat was being pulled into a whirlpool."" A survivor named Madhulata, who lost her 12-year-old daughter while her husband is missing, said, ""I told them not to rescue me. There's no point in staying alive.""",The News Minute,"""I told them not to rescue me. There's no point in staying alive. At 33 years, my life is over,"" Madhulata tells her visitors at the Rajahmundry Government General Hospital, pausing to weep in between sentences. Madhulata had just been taken to the mortuary to see the body of her 12-year-old daughter Hasini, who lost her life in the Godavari boat tragedy on Sunday. Her cries ring across the hospital room, as she weeps for her child.Madhulata's husband, Subramanyam, is one of the 24 people still missing, most of whom are presumed to be dead. A short, fun family holiday to Bhadrachalam has now ended in Madhulata losing her only child, and possibly her husband, to the violent waters of the Godavari.At the hospital are 17 other survivors of the accident, who were brought here from Devipatnam around midnight on Sunday. Earlier in the day, they had all been on a boat called the Royal Vashishta, which had capsized while carrying 61 people, near Kachuluru village of Devipatnam mandal in East Godavari district.Less than 24 hours have passed since the disaster. Most of the survivors are steeped in trauma – of having nearly lost their lives, of identifying the bodies while fearing the worst. A fun holiday gone horribly wrong“My colleagues and I had been planning the trip for a while. Now I have lost two of my close friends. I don't know when this feeling of depression will stop,"" says Jyoti Babu, a carpenter in his 20s, who had gone on the boat ride with four of his friends who all work in carpentry or construction.The boat was filled with similar groups of friends and family, who were looking to have a good time on the picturesque boat ride in the Godavari through the Papikondalu (Papi hills) to Bhadrachalam.According to the survivors, the boat left from the Gandi Pochamma temple sometime after 11 am. Within a few minutes, they were instructed by the boat crew to put on their life jackets, as they were approaching a police station. ""They didn't tell us how to wear them, how to tighten the belt properly etc. The police then did a check, took photos and let the boat go ahead,"" says Jyoti Babu. Survivors say that most of them soon removed their jackets and placed them under their chairs, unable to bear the humidity, but the crew never took the life jackets seriously. ""Even the few people wearing it had just slipped them on loosely,"" Jyoti Babu says.As passengers moved to the top deck, where a performance area and a sun shelter had been set up, the boat shook once even in the beginning of the journey, Jyoti Babu claims, but the crew kept assuring passengers that the driver would be careful, in spite of overloading. ""The entertainment staff explicitly said that we were approaching waters of dangerous depth, but the driver would be careful,"" he says.The entertainment staff were singing and dancing to film songs in the performance area, with some passengers joining in, says Prabhakar, a 47-year-old railways employee from Kazipet in Warangal, who had been planning the trip with his group of friends for months.""As we neared Kachuluru, they just told us to go back to our seats and not to move, as it was a dangerous area. Our life jackets were still under our chairs,"" Prabhakar says, recalling the exact moment of the accident. ""The boat started to tilt to our side. Since the chairs were not fixed to the deck floor, the chair from the other end started tumbling down. Then the people also began to fall on us,"" he says. He expected this to be a small tremor, like earlier, and waited for the boat to come back to its position. ""Slowly, water started to enter through the railing and I realised this was really happening, the boat was capsizing,"" he recalls.Madhulata also recalls how everything happened so quickly, there was no time to react  ""It took less than a minute for the boat to topple. Within the next two minutes, most of the people had drowned,"" she says.Rescue for a fortunate few As the boat started to drown, many passengers tried to hold on to the railing, as the unused orange life jackets began to float all around them. Some of them, like Prabhakar and Jyoti Babu, tried to throw the life jackets to others around them, so they could hold on to them and try to stay afloat.""The boat was being pulled into a whirlpool. If we stayed there, even the life jacket would have been of no help, so I swam away from the whirlpool, holding onto the jacket,"" Jyoti Babu says.He says they were lucky that the accident happened at a place where they were visible to the fishermen from Tutukunta, who instantly arrived in their fishing boats to rescue people who had tried to swim to safety. ""They did multiple trips to try and rescue as many people as they could, almost everyone who has survived owes their life to the fishing community there,"" says Prabhakar.Prabhakar's friend Suresh, who tried to save another friend Avinash, held onto him until the fishing boat arrived. But only after hauling his friend on to the boat, Suresh realised that his friend had already breathed his last.The fishermen, who knew the river in those parts inside out, told the survivors that the driver must have been really inexperienced to have taken the boat so close to the whirlpool. ""They told us that the location of the countercurrent is commonly known, and boats are usually directed along the edge of the river to avoid going too close to the vortex,” Jyoti Babu says.Prabhakar says the survivors reached Tutukunta around 1.40 pm, which means the accident might have occurred just a few minutes earlier, around 1.15 pm. About a half hour later, an Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) mobile medical boat arrived at Tutukunta, having spotted the trail of floating life jackets. The survivor group was then taken to a medical camp in Rampachodavaram, where they were provided first aid, before being moved to the Rajahmundry GGH.The traumaSixteen men and two women survivors were brought to the Rajahmundry GGH. Most of them do not have any visible injuries, except a couple of people who've had minor fractures. One man, who was travelling with his wife, friend and friend's wife, and is the lone survivor of his group as of now, has been sent to the ICU. But the trauma haunting the survivors almost has a physical form of its own. While some people cope with tears, some are frozen in a state of numbness even as they recount their stories to visiting politicians and reporters.Prabhakar, who was the only survivor in the ward who could speak without visible emotional scars, says that he had gotten used to speaking to the media since yesterday, as that was the only way he could think of communicating to his family that he was safe, having lost his phone in the accident and being unable to recall any phone numbers.There is anger and resentment among the survivors that they're not sure whom to direct to: the allegedly inexperienced boat driver, the government departments who failed to stop the unlicensed boat, or the police for not ensuring implementation of safety measures.The state government has announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh for families of those who've died in the accident. But as of now, there seems to be no cure in sight for the psychological impact that the incident has had on survivors. ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/boat-was-pulled-whirlpool-godavari-boat-tragedy-survivors-recall-horror-109005?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Except for a few item numbers, Hazel didn't appear in any film post Bodyguard and the reason is not because she wasn't offered any but because she felt she was being typecast as an actress.In her latest interview with Hindustan Times, Hazel, who is now happily married to cricketer Yuvraj Singh, spoke at length about why her acting career was shortlived and how she felt frustrated after on point in time. ""For me, it was frustrating coming to Bollywood, growing up in a very Hindu-traditional Indian household with a British father and trying to convince people that I am Indian after being judged by my name and accent"", confessed the actress further stating that thankfully things are changing todayfor the good as she added, ""In my years in India, I have seen Bollywood change from having certain requirements like knowing classical dance and speaking Hindi to having none of those matter anymore.

Especially those who thought it was all over when Federer had 16-17 and Rafa had 14,"" he said.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Roger Federer will not be losing any sleep over whether rival Rafa Nadal can match his men’s record 20 Grand Slam singles titles, according to his long-term coach Severin Luthi. The 38-year-old Swiss began the year three ahead of second-placed Nadal’s haul but the Spaniard claimed a 12th French Open title this year followed up by winning the U.S. Open this month. It has re-energised the GOAT (greatest of all time) debate with Nadal, who has 19 slams, looking back to his best after injury concerns earlier this year. Never in his career has Nadal been only one Grand Slam title behind Federer, who squandered two match points against Novak Djokovic in this year’s Wimbledon final. “No, I don’t think he stresses (about Nadal catching him up),” Swiss Luthi, who has toured with Federer since 2007, told Reuters in an interview. “He focuses on himself. He has a lot of respect for Rafa and knows what it takes to win that many titles. “I don’t see him in any way stressed. He won’t be completely destroyed if Rafa makes the 20.” Luthi said fans of tennis should savour watching the two greats, rather than obsess about who is superior. “It’s good for the fans. Especially the ones who thought it was all over when Roger had 16 or 17 and Rafa had 14.” Luthi is captain of the Swiss Davis Cup team that has had to make do without Federer and three-times Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka for the past four years. They were both absent again when Switzerland lost to Slovakia in a Group I clash in Bratislava, meaning there is no chance Switzerland could play in the revamped Davis Cup Finals until 2021 at the earliest. Federer’s decision not top play Davis Cup could effect his eligibility for the Tokyo Olympics, although Luthi said no final decision had been made on whether he will play in Tokyo. “It’s possible but it’s not a goal,” Luthi said. “He will leave it open a little bit. I don’t know how it works with (Olympic) wildcards. They used to give them to the small countries, but I think if he said he wanted to play....” Federer and Nadal, whose rivalry has always been respectful, will join forces this week at the Laver Cup in Geneva when Europe take on the Rest of the World.

1193,Youngsters will have to prove themselves in 4-5 opportunities: Kohli,"Team India captain Virat Kohli has said that the youngsters would get four to five opportunities to prove themselves in T20I cricket. ""We have 30 odd games (before T20 World Cup). From team's point of view, it is very clear. Even when I got into the team it is not like I was expecting 15 opportunities,"" he added.",CricTracker,"India are in the middle of a team-building process that started off following their disappointing outing in the ICC World Cup in May-July. The Men in Blue are now looking forward to the T20 World Cup in Australia later in 2020 and with a big pool of players to choose from, the captain has drawn the lines. Skipper Virat Kohli has said the new players who would be picked have four to five opportunities to prove their worth.Speaking ahead of his team’s first T20I against South Africa in Dharamsala that got washed out on Sunday, Kohli said the same had applied even for himself when he started. The 30-year-old made his India debut in 2008 and has seen a phenomenal run with over 20k runs scored across three formats with 68 international hundreds.Advertisement“We are very clear. It is not that anyone will get 30 chances. Even when I came in the team, I didn’t think I will get 15-20 games and I knew I will mostly get chances in three to five games and I have to prove myself. One will get suppose five chances and he will have to prove himself. That is the level we are playing at. As the team management has that mindset, the individual should also have the same,” Kohli was heard saying while speaking during an interaction on bcci.tv.The 2007 world champions in T20Is will be playing around 30 T20Is before the T20 World Cup. About the number of games that each player would get, Kohli said the management would figure it out. “It is a delicate balance to strike but as we have 30 games before it (World Cup), so we have to figure out how much time each individual gets,” the ace batsman added.When being asked whether the T20I series against the Proteas marks the beginning of India’s preparation for the T20 World Cup next year, Kohli said along with it, the ongoing ICC World Test Championship is also being kept under consideration.“We feel both the T20Is and the Test championship are in our focus as both of them are milestones and that is why youngsters are being pushed in from time to time as it is important to settle the team combination because we have to figure out the guys who will take the team forward,” Kohli stated.India are currently on top of the points table in the World Test Championship with 120 points picked from the recent two-Test series against the West Indies. They will next take on South Africa in a three-game series at home and Kohli and Co. will look to maintain the lead.",https://www.crictracker.com/new-players-have-to-prove-themselves-in-four-to-five-chances-says-virat-kohli/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
1194,YouTube tests 'card' feature to show users' comment history,"YouTube is testing a feature called profile cards to list a commenter's recent comments over the past 12 months on a channel when clicked on the commenter's name. Presently, clicking on a commenter's name directs users to their channel. ""We hope that it will...help creators recognise some of their best commenters,"" YouTube's Director of Product Management Tom Leung said.",TechCrunch,"YouTube  commenters will now have their channel loyalty — or their tendency to troll — exposed, thanks to a new feature called profile cards, now in testing. Recently announced by way of YouTube’s Creator Insider channel, where the company shares updates and changes with its creator community, these new profile cards would appear whenever you clicked on a commenter’s name, and would list all their other recent comments on the channel.Currently, if you click on a commenter’s name, you’re redirected to their channel page on YouTube.But that doesn’t allow the video creator or other commenters to learn much about the person behind a given comment, in many cases, as not everyone publishes to YouTube. The commenter’s channel could be sparse, out of date or completely unrelated to the topic at hand.With the new profile cards, however, you’ll instead be able to see all the recent comments left on the channel over the past 12 months. However, it won’t show their comments left on other channels at this time. In other words, it’s not a full user profile, similar to what you would find on other message board sites like Reddit, where a complete comment history is available for each user.“It will help you get a sense of what this person is writing,” explains YouTube Director of Product Management Tom Leung, in the annoucement published in the past week. “We hope that it will strengthen connections with others in the YouTube community and will help creators recognize some of their best commenters,” he added.Though not mentioned, the new feature also could help creators recognize some of their worst commenters, as well — meaning, those who only show up to troll, derail discussions or otherwise cause problems.Being able to see a history of someone’s comments would allow a video creator or moderator to make a more informed decision about whether future comments from the same user should be hidden or, conversely, if the user is trustworthy enough to earn a spot on the “approved users” list so their comments get published automatically.The new profile card also will include a link to the commenter’s YouTube channel, but it doesn’t redirect you there as before. YouTube didn’t say how broadly the experiment is being rolled out for testing’s sake, but it was well-received by the community members reacting to the announcement at the time.The test is one of several experiments running on YouTube at present. Another will allow video creators to display a personalized message to help attract new subscribers, the video also noted.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/youtube-tests-profile-cards-that-show-users-comment-history/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

KhataBook has raised a $20-million Series A round from DST Partners Fund, Ribbit Capital along with 20 angel investors, the sources added.",Entrackr,"Weeding out the paper from conventional khata-bahi (bookkeeping) appears to be a segment that is drawing unprecedented interest from venture capitalists.Top tier VCs such as Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed and hedge fund Tiger Global have already picked up their bets in the segment, which did not exist a year ago. We have never seen such confidence for institutional investors in a B2B segment so early.While the first two investors chose OKCredit in the segment, Sequoia put a bet on its Surge’s accelerator portfolio – KhataBook.DST Partners Fund, Ribbit Capital along with 20 top angels were reportedly investing $20 million Series A round in KhataBook. According to three Entrackr sources, the round has already been executed. Now, it’s raising a new round in what appears to be a Series B from Tencent and GGV Capital.“It’s in advanced discussion to raise $80-85 million fresh financing round from Tencent and GGV Capital,” said two sources aware with the details of the deal on condition of anonymity. The investment from the Chinese conglomerate in KhataBook is coming at a time when Tiger Global and Lightspeed Venture Capital ramped their stakes in its rival OKCredit by investing over $60 million. Entrackr had exclusively reported the deal on Friday. “While Tencent will be putting about $70-75 million, the remaining $5-10 million will come from GGV,” added sources. According to them, the contours of the deal has been finalised, and it will be announced soon. This is the first pure-play B2B investment for Tencent in India.KhataBook is a cash management tool, specially designed for tier II, tier III and beyond, used by 500 different types of businesses. Recently, it claimed 12X merchant onboarding growth between March to July this year. According to KhataBook’s founder and CEO, Ravish Naresh, the company had crossed 20,000 crore entries in August. Further, it claims that Shopkeepers across 3,000 Indian cities are using KhataBook along with it being used in Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.So far, Tencent invested in seven firms including five Unicorns – BYJU’s, Dream11, Hike, Swiggy and Ola. It also put money in Flipkart (now exited) and OTA – ibibo (now part of MMT) and TIL-hatched music streaming app Gaana. On the other hand, KhataBook would be the second bet for GGV capital in Indian B2B space. Last month, GGV invested $15 million in Udaan. Entrackr had exclusively reported its participation in $300 million closure by B2B marketplace in ongoing Series D round. The VC firm with 11 Unicorns in its global portfolio such as Airbnb, Bytedance, Xiaomi, Slack and Wish also invested in Tala. Tala generates credit profile to enable collateral-free loans to consumers. It announced Indian launch along with its Series D round.KhataBook competes directly with OkCredit and indirectly with Vypaar.Queries sent to Tencent and KhataBook on late Monday didn’t elicit any immediate responses. We will update the post as and when they respond. GGV Capital couldn’t be contacted immediately.Though there has been an unprecedented interest of VCs in the nascent bookkeeping space, none of the companies has revealed their monetisation plans. It’s no secret that they would eventually target lending in one form or another to make money. Since there are dozens of fintech companies in B2B and B2C segments eyeing to make money via lending, the bigger question: who all survive until monetisation phase?",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/exclusive-tencent-investing-75-mn-in-khatabook/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1208,"FB announces trimming tool for live videos, IGTV scheduling feature","Facebook announced several new updates and features for content and video creators on Monday. The new features include a trimming tool for live videos, publishing and scheduling video content on Instagram and IGTV for up to six months in advance and a 'rehearsal' feature to broadcast live only to Page admins and editors to test new production setups, etc.",TechCrunch,"Facebook  on Monday announced a number of updates aimed at video creators and publishers, during a session at the International Broadcasting Convention (IBC) taking place in Amsterdam. The updates involve changes to live video broadcasting, Facebook’s Watch Party and Creator Studio, and they include enhancements to tools, expanded feature sets and improved analytics, among other things.The highlights include better ways to prep for and simulcast live broadcasts, ways to take better advantage of Watch Party events, new metrics to track video performance and a much-anticipated option to schedule Instagram/IGTV  content for up to six months in advance.Live videoIn terms of live video, Facebook says it listened to feedback from those who have been broadcasting live on its platform, and is now rolling out several highly requested features to Facebook Pages (not Profiles.) The changes are an attempt to better accommodate professional broadcasters who want to use Facebook’s live broadcasting capabilities instead of or in addition to other platforms, like YouTube.Through the Live API, publishers can now use a “rehearsal” feature to broadcast live only to Page admins and editors in order to test new production setups, interactive features and show formats before going live to a full audience. QVC has tested this feature, as they broadcast live on Facebook for hundreds of hours per month, and have wanted to try out new workflows and formats.Publishers will also be able to trim the beginning and end of a live video, and can live broadcast for as long as eight hours — double the previous limit of four hours.This latter capability has already been used by NASA, which broadcast an eight-hour spacewalk, for example, and it also leaves room for broadcasting things like live sports, news events and Twitch-like gaming broadcasts.Most notably, perhaps, is that the company realizes live broadcasters need to serve their audiences outside of Facebook. Now, publishers will be able to use apps that let them stream to more than one streaming service at once, by simulcasting via the Live API.Live video recently rolled out to Facebook Lite, as well, the company also noted.Watch PartyFacebook additionally announced a few new updates for its co-watching feature, Watch Party, which include the ability for Pages to schedule a party in advance to build anticipation, support for “replays” that will let others enjoy the video after airing, the ability to tag business partners in branded content and new analytics.As for the latter, two new metrics are being added to Creator Studio: Minutes Viewed and Unique 60s Viewers (total number of unique users that watched at least 60 seconds in a Watch Party). These complement existing metrics like reach and engagement.The Live Commenting feature, which allows a host to go live in a Watch Party to share their own commentary, is also now globally available.Creator StudioAnd wrapping all this up is an update to Creator Studio, which is what publishers use to post, manage, monetize and measure their content across both Facebook and Instagram.The dashboard will soon add a new visualization layer in Loyalty Insights to help creators see which videos loyal fans want to see by measuring which videos drive return viewers.A new Distribution metric will score each video’s performance based on the Page’s historic average on a range of metrics, including: 1 Minute Views, Average Minutes Watched and Retention. This feature, rolling out in the next few months, will offer an easy-to-read snapshot of a video’s performance.Creator Studio will also now support 13 more languages for auto-captioning: Arabic, Chinese, German, Hindi, Italian, Malay, Russian, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Urdu and Vietnamese. These are in addition to those languages already available, which included English, French, Portuguese and Spanish.Instagram & IGTV scheduling And finally, publishers and creators will be able to publish and schedule their Instagram Feed and IGTV content for up to six months. In a few more months, Instagram Feed and IGTV drafting and editing will also become available, the company says.This feature was already spotted in the wild before today’s announcement, and it set the social media management and influencer community abuzz. It also follows an update to the Instagram API last year to allow scheduling by third-party applications. However, a native feature is not as limited as some of those other options.The feature is now open to all creators and publishers with Facebook Pages, whereas before some were seeing it labeled only as “coming soon” or were not able to get it working. Story scheduling is not yet included here, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see it added further down the road.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/facebook-rolls-out-new-video-tools-plus-instagram-and-igtv-scheduling-feature/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1212,Evidence indicates Iranian arms used in Saudi attack: Saudis,"The Saudi-led military coalition battling Yemen's Houthi movement said on Monday that the attack on Saudi Arabian oil plants was carried out with Iranian weapons. ""The terrorist attack did not originate from Yemen as the Houthi militia claimed,"" coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Iran had dismissed US accusations that it was responsible for the assault on Saudi oil facilities.",Reuters,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Monday that the attack on its oil facilities was carried out with Iranian weapons, according to a preliminary investigation, but stopped short of directly blaming regional foe Iran. A foreign ministry statement said Riyadh would invite international experts, including from the United Nations, to participate in investigating Saturday’s assault, which cut almost half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production. The United States, which has blamed Iran for the strikes, is studying all available options in addressing the assault, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a phone call on Monday, Saudi state media said.  “Initial investigations show that Iranian weapons were used in the attacks and work is going on to determine the source of those attacks,” the foreign ministry statement said. “The kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks,” it added. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement has claimed responsibility for the strikes, but the spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition battling the group said preliminary findings indicated the attack was not launched from Yemen. Tehran has dismissed the U.S. accusations as “unacceptable” and said it was ready for a “full-fledged war.” Riyadh called on the world to condemn those behind the attack on the world’s top oil exporter, a key regional U.S. ally which has supported U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum-pressure” campaign on Shi’ite Muslim Iran. Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, told Esper that Iranian threats “are not only directed to the kingdom, but affect the Middle East and the world,” news agency SPA said. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who also called the crown prince on Monday, offered his country’s “full support and capabilities” to the Gulf Arab state, it added.  The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials had said intelligence indicated Iran was the “staging ground” for the attack and had shared the information with Riyadh. It quoted people familiar with the discussions. Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told reporters in Riyadh earlier on Monday that authorities were still determining the launch location. “The terrorist attack did not originate from Yemen as the Houthi militia claimed,” he said, adding that authorities would reveal the location from where drones were launched at a future news conference. The Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim countries intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognized government from power in the capital Sanaa, to prevent Iran from gaining influence through the group. The movement, which denies being a puppet of Tehran and says it is fighting a corrupt system, recently stepped up drone and missile attacks on Saudi cities. The conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

The News Minute report said that the wire was not isolated or buried properly by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) personnel. A police case under section 304A (death due to negligence) was registered against the TNEB personnel.,The News Minute,"Less than 4 days after an illegal hoarding turned death trap for a 23-year-old Chennai techie, another life has been lost in the city due to sheer negligence. On Sunday night, Dheena Senthil, a 14-year-old boy was electrocuted to death after coming in contact with an exposed live wire on the street.The incident happened at around 10 pm in Dhanam Nagar, near the old post office in Chennai’s Mugalivakkam neighbourhood.Dheena, a resident of the neighbourhood, was walking on the street when he stepped on the electricity board wire which had not been isolated and buried properly by Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) personnel.Although a few people saw Dheena get electrocuted, they could not rescue him as he died instantly.According to reports, the road had been dug up by the electricity board to lay wires for street lights and drainage pipes in the locality. However, the works had not been completed and the workers had temporarily covered the wires with mud, instead of isolating and burying them properly.With rains over the last few days, the mud on top was dislodged, exposing the live wire underneath killing Dheena when he came in contact with it.Following the boy’s death, several people pointed out the negligence by the Chennai Corporation and the TNEB personnel which led to the tragic incident.Local channels reported that aggrieved residents staged a protest and halted traffic following the boy’s death on Sunday night and that tensions dissolved only after police officers arrived and promised to take action against the erring TNEB officials.However, officers of the T4 Mangadu police station who are charged with investigating the case deny that protests had occurred in the neighbourhood.“A few people had witnessed the boy’s death and had been standing there. However, there were no agitations or protests when we reached there,” an officer from the police station told TNM.Dheena was a class 9 student of the government higher secondary school in KK Nagar. He is survived by his father Senthil and mother Vanitha. Following his death, Senthil filed a complaint at the Mangadu police station where officers have registered a case under section 304A (death due to negligence) against TNEB personnel.This the second life lost due to negligence by government bodies in the city within the span of a week.

The court has ordered an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to be given to Subhasri’s family, allowing the government to recover the amount from the salaries of the errant officials.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/one-more-death-due-negligence-chennai-teenager-electrocuted-exposed-live-wire-108988?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
1226,Hyderabad college that asked girls to wear long kurtis withdraws dress code,Hyderabad's St Francis College for Women which made it mandatory for girls to wear long kurtis has withdrawn the dress code. This comes after students protested against the dress code and had alleged moral policing by the college authorities since August. A student earlier claimed that college authorities told them that a long kurti would get them good marriage proposals.,The News Minute,"In a big win for the students of Hyderabad’s St Francis Women’s College, the management on Monday finally lifted the diktat to wear knee-length kurtis to the college. The students of the college had been protesting against the controversial dress code and had alleged moral policing by the college authorities since August.On Monday morning, the students had blocked the entrance to the college in order to strike a dialogue with the college management.Speaking to TNM, a student at the college campus said the dress-code has been lifted and the same was informed to the student representatives who were in discussions with the St. Francis management. ""We are now allowed to dress as per the undertaking which allows us to wear clothes except mini-skirts and crop tops,"" the student added.The dress code, which was brought into force from August 1, made it mandatory for the students to wear knee-length kurtis. The students were not happy with the decision as it was not easy for a section of students to change their wardrobe in between a semester and also many could not afford the college's new decision. They also said the new dress code didn’t aim at bringing uniformity among students but was a result of regressive patriarchal mind-set.The students claimed that their attempts to hold a discussion with the management were futile as they were again moral-policed and told that their parents sent them to college in order to “get good marriage proposals” in the future.The situation worsened on Friday when the college appointed female security guards who heckled the students and prevented them from attending classes for wearing kurtis that were slightly above the knee. A video of the college principal, Sr Sandra Horta, also emerged, where she was seen checking the dress of the students.A student had then told TNM, “We don't want to be a part of an institution that wants to institutionalise this kind of patriarchy. Speaking to us in such a tone, giving us subliminal messages that we are arousing males, I don't think is a very appropriate environment or a good environment for all of us to be in. I don't think it helps our intellectual development either.”Despite repeated attempts, the school principal did not respond to the calls or messages from TNM on the issue.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/big-win-students-hyd-s-st-francis-college-withdraws-controversial-dress-code-108970?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The FIR pertains to an approach that was made to one of the women cricketers of the team.

But we hope the SIT will submit a better and comprehensive report next time,” the bench added.The court said the only reason it was refraining from passing a more critical order was that it realised the officer concerned had failed to make any significant progress in the past few weeks due to floods in Kolhapur.Earlier, during the hearing, the CBI, which is investigating the Dabholkar case, also submitted a progress report on its probe.While Dabholkar was shot dead on August 20, 2013 in Pune, Pansare was shot at on February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur and succumbed to his injuries a few days later on February 20. The SIT was formed after the family members of Pansare and Dabholkar moved HC demanding court monitoring of the probe.Meanwhile, a court in Kolhapur increased the police custody awarded to the three accused in Pansare murder case by another 4 days. Sachin Andure, Amit Baddi and Ganesh Miskin were sent to 10 days of custody on September 6. They were presented before the court upon completion of the remand. The court awarded additional four day’s custody to the police.During interrogation the three accused revealed names of three other who had companied them to the jungles near Belgaum where they underwent training on an air pistol. The trio had conducted recce in various parts of Kolhapur to target Pansare. However, Andure, the key person, is not providing complete information, the SIT told th Court.Andure is suspected to be the shooter who shot at Dabholkar in Pune.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/sep/16/bombay-high-court-dissatisfied-with-probe-report-on-pansare-murder-case-2034532.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The move aims to stop them from committing malpractices and improve the Indian health insurance sector, their joint report said. It also suggested other practices for effective healthcare through health insurance.",The Financial Express,"Ayushman Bharat ‘Name and Shame’ guidelines: Health insurance fraudsters under Ayushman Bharat should be publicly named and shamed in a bid to deter them from committing malpractices, a Joint Working Group (JWG) report of National Health Authority (NHA) and IRDAI has recommended. The fraudsters may include hospitals, health care providers, intermediaries and policyholders. The report defines ‘Name and Shame’ as “a system for public dissemination of information about an entity/person/organization involved in committing fraud under a health protection scheme of the Government or under an insurance program/policy.”If implemented, the JWG recommendations may affect a big change in the overall health insurance sector as well in the long run and benefit common people. While naming and shaming of defaulters is a regular practice in the banking sector, there is no clearly defined policies or guidelines for such practices for the health insurance sector. The NHA-IRDAI report may become the first step in this regard.The JWG has made recommendations for naming and shaming of fraudsters for discussion and deliberation among the health insurance stakeholders in India. The report notes “insurance industry would benefit by developing the guidelines for intermediaries, rogue policyholders.”ALSO READ |Ayushman Bharat: NHA, IRDAI launch ‘four’ reports to further strengthen AB-PMJAYIn what may be a “small beginning at different – incremental levels” to prevent health insurance frauds and give more power to policyholders, the JWG has made the following recommendations:When the fraudulent activity has been confirmed, the government authority /agency/insurance firm /TPA (third-party administrator) should take following steps:– Issue warning or show-cause notice to the hospitals found to be indulging in fraudulent activities, depending on the seriousness of the fraud.– The warning, or show cause notice, should be followed by the process of suspension and de-empanelment as per the contract.The hospital would removed from the list of network hospitals if it fails to “satisfactorily explain/respond to show-cause notice or continue to indulge in malpractice”.– The list of de-empanelled/blacklisted hospitals will be mentioned on the website of the Government Authority/SHA/Agency/Insurance firm/ TPA. The JWG has recommended that this list should be “prominently displayed and easily accessible on the website”.– Hospitals which have been served with warnings, show-cause notice or suspended temporarily will also be mentioned in a separate list on the websites.– The de-empanelled hospital may be allowed to re-apply for empanelment after a gap of minimum 6 months-1 years after it submits proof of having “mended unethical ways”.– The IRDAI may prepare an industry de-empanelled/blacklist every and display on its website. The NHA will prepare a similar list for hospitals empanelled with PM-JAY/Government schemes.– The JWG has also recommended to sensitize and inform policyholders and health workers about the de-empanelled hospitals. Setting up of Whistle Blower mechanisms has also been recommended.Commenting on the recommendations, Dr Indu Bhushan, CEO, NHA had stated, “The recommendations in the report are a step forward in enabling quality healthcare and access to the patients.

""Actors set their own fees, so a writer should also set his or her fees according to how hard one has worked,"" he added. Kamlesh said writers should incorporate suggestions from actors and producers as long as it helps the story.",Times Now,"Rang De Basanti writer Kamlesh Pandey on Sunday said he was so driven to make the Aamir Khan-starrer that he took on the job for ""very less"" remuneration.In his career of over 30 years, Pandey has penned blockbusters and acclaimed films like Saudagar, Tezaab and Delhi 6.At a session organised by the Screenwriters Association (SWA), Pandey said today there is a new plan which ensures fair pay to writers.""Actors set their own fees, so a writer should also set his/her fees according to how hard one has worked. For example, I took about a year to write Rang De Basanti and it took six years for it to be a final film. The money I got, the spot boy would've got paid more,"" Pandey said.""I don't feel sad about that though. I agreed because I wanted to make this film at any cost. It was my decision because I could afford to do that. That I could work for less money,"" he added.The writer said money was not a factor for him in his initial days as he was cushioned by an advertising job.""I moonlighted as an advertising professional and a film-TV writer. I kept the safety net of advertising for a long time, till 1992, and then left it.""Whether a job or something else, you have to have something for yourself. It wouldn't work if you only depend on writing. If you are a new writer in this expensive city, it's difficult to survive purely on writing.""Pandey further noted a writer must always keep in mind the time his story is set in and update it accordingly.Citing an example from Rang De Basanti, the scribe said when he was penning the Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra-directed movie, six films on Bhagat Singh had already flopped.""I was turned down from everywhere because people called it 'another film on Bhagat Singh after six flops'. I told them it's about young India. Bhagat Singh is a device. 'What he would do if he was here today, what are the children of today doing?'
""But people didn't get the script. In fact, we had gone with the film to a big superstar's son. But his mother said My son won't die!"" he said.Asked if a writer should always hold their ground when there is a suggestion from the producer or actor to tweak the script, Pandey said they should roll with it as long as it helps the story.""The climax of Rang De Basanti was set in the Lok Sabha where the men go and carry a shootout. We debated a month over this that it would never get censor (certificate). You can't use Lok Sabha for this. Aamir said he had an idea.""For some other film of his, he had kept a situation that the men enter a radio station and give their statement from there.

1245,Pant will be rapped on the knuckles if he repeats mistakes: Shastri,"Team India head coach Ravi Shastri has said that 21-year-old wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant will be rapped on the knuckles if he repeats his mistakes. ""No one will change his style but match awareness and shot selection become crucial in particular situations,"" Shastri added. ""It's time for him to...just show the world how devastating he is,"" he further said.",CricTracker,"There is little denying the fact that Rishabh Pant is set to get an extended run in the Indian team across formats. The highly-rated youngster is being widely seen as MS Dhoni’s apt replacement. Thus the team-management is unlikely to drop Pant anytime soon. However, India head coach Ravi Shastri has sent a timely reminder to the youngster about his place in the team.Shastri has made it clear that Pant cannot take his position in the side for granted, saying that the youngster will be ‘rapped on the knuckles’ if he keeps on playing rash shots. Pant received widespread criticism for his performance in West Indies. It was the first time, he was picked in the ODI and the T20I side as the number one wicketkeeper-batsman. A good outing in the Caribbean Islands would have pretty much sealed Pant’s place in the team.AdvertisementHowever, the Delhi star failed to grab the opportunity and performed miserably. Barring the fifty in the third T20I, he did not make much of an impact. What made things worse for him was his poor shots. Pant showed little application and was out playing rash shots more often than not. But Shastri has now sent a timely reminder to Pant, asking the batsman to bat smartly.“We’ll let him be but at times when you see a shot, like the first ball dismissal in Trinidad, if he repeats that, then he will be told. There will be a rap on the knuckles, talent or no talent,” Shastri told Star Sports.“As simple as that. Because you are letting the team down, forget letting yourselves down. In a situation where you have the captain at the other end, a target to chase, the need of the hour is sensible cricket,” he added.While Rishabh Pant’s aggressive batting style has often attracted debate, Shastri said that changing the style is never an option. The coach said that the batsmen need to read the game well in order to succeed. He also asked Pant to step up and start delivering.“No one will even think of changing his style. Like Virat said, reading the situation, match-awareness and shot-selection becomes crucial. If he can fathom that, he could be unstoppable. It could take one game, it could take four games. He has played so much IPL cricket, he will learn. It’s time now for him to step up and show how devastating he can be,” Shastri said with captain Virat Kohli by his side.",https://www.crictracker.com/india-head-coach-ravi-shastri-fires-warning-to-rishabh-pant/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Having lost the toss, to play as we did was fantastic. We drove the game all the time and got there in the end,"" England captain Joe Root said.Steve Smith proved a formidable presence at No. 4 for Australia throughout the series but was caught by Ben Stokes at leg gully off pacer Stuart Broad for 23, by far his lowest score of the series.Smith finished with 774 runs in the series in seven innings at an average of 110. The star batter received a standing ovation from England and Australia fans as he left the field on Sunday, a strong sign Smith has been forgiven after a ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal.Matthew Wade was Australia's top scorer with 117 after beginning to worry England as the visitors chased an unlikely winning target of 399. Wade was stumped off a delivery from Root.Broad took 4-62 and spinner Jack Leach 4-49 for England.Earlier, England resumed its second innings on 313-8 and was all out for 329.""England got ahead of the game.

1248,You never write off champion players: Justin Langer on David Warner,"Talking about David Warner, who scored 95 runs in 2019 Ashes, Australia head coach Justin Langer said, ""It doesn’t matter what sport...you never write off champion players. They tend to come good, don't they?"" ""There’s plenty of upside still to his batting,"" Langer added. Notably, England fast bowler Stuart Broad dismissed Warner 7 out of 10 times in the series.",Cricket Country,"One batsman who will want to quickly forget the Ashes 2019 series is David Warner, who’s horrific show with the bat ended with a dreadful average of just 9.50.Stuart Broad terrorised Warner with his around-the-wicket line and removed the southpaw for the seventh time across his 10 innings that set a new Test record.Such an instance has occurred on only five other occasions when a bowler dismissed a player seven times in a single series. The last time this happened was in the previous Ashes series where Australia spin bowler Nathan Lyon haunted Moeen Ali.READ: David Warner’s horror Ashes series ends as Stuart Broad gets him out for record-equalling 7th timeDespite his form, Warner found vital support from head coach Justin Langer. “I think, talking frankly, he let Stuart Broad get into his head and he thought way too much about it,” Langer said.After his 61-run knock in the first innings of the third Test at Headingley, the 11 runs he scored in his final innings at Manchester on Sunday was Warner’s second highest score in the series. He also has 3 consecutive ducks in the series.“I’ve seen it before, even with the great players, every now and then they have a series – and I’m talking about the all-time great players – they have a series where…I remember Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) with Andrew Flintoff, I remember seeing Steve Waugh sit on the team bus in South Africa and the guy had been a run machine for so long, he got out just before stumps and I, in a sick sort of way, thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen,” Langer said.ALSO READ: Steve Smith, Pat Cummins remain on top in Test Rankings“In this instance I don’t think David solved the puzzle, and he’ll be first to admit that, he’ll probably be very relieved he gets on the Qantas flight in a day’s time and doesn’t have to face Stuart Broad for a while I reckon. But he is certainly, there’s plenty of upside still to his batting. I’ve learned over a long period you never write off champion players, it doesn’t matter what sport, you never write off champion players. They tend to come good, don’t they? So, he’s had a tough series, no doubt about that, but he’s also a champion player so usually with champion players they get a bit more time to come good.”Meanwhile, Langer believes that although there has been great improvement in the Australian team over his 16 months in charge, there should be more for the side to reach greatness.“It’s something we’re getting better at, how we back up after a win.“That probably comes with the maturity of the group as well. It’s ok to fight back when you are underdogs and it’s one of those Australian things – we love the underdog tag. To fight back from a tough loss is admirable and I said how proud I was with everyone for that.ALSO READ: Steve Smith in a class of his own and other talking points“But also over the last couple of years we haven’t necessarily performed at our best after a win. Really good teams do that. We didn’t do that too well after the first Test at Lord’s. We didn’t do it after this Test. There have been some Test series over the last couple of years where the team hasn’t been able to. I think that’ll be part of the maturity of our side. If you probably think about it, the way we were in this series, we aren’t a great team yet.“We are a good team, we are a maturing team. We have got some great players in it. But we’re aspiring to be a great cricket team. You got to work hard and get consistent results to achieve that. That comes from experience and learning how to win. That comes with players individually getting more experienced and the team working together.

1250,Govt seeks to limit private carpooling to 4 rides a day: Report,"The Central Government has reportedly finalised the draft policy guidelines for carpooling by private car owners. The guidelines include a KYC of users of the service to be made mandatory. The draft policy, which will go for public comments soon, also includes limiting a maximum of four rides per day per individual.",The News Minute,"The Central Government has finalized the draft policy guidelines for the car-pooling service being run as a commercial venture by private car owners. This is being worked on by the Ministry of Transportation’s road transport division.  According to an Economic Times report, the highlights of the guidelines include a KYC of users of the service to be made mandatory and fixing a maximum of four rides per day per individual. The Ministry may first place the draft guidelines for obtaining comments from the public before forwarding them to the states.The crux of this policy will be that the venture must be run on a ‘no-profit-no-loss’ basis. The broad objective is to share the cost of using the vehicles between the users so that no one is at a loss and at the same time, there will be lesser number of cars on the roads bringing the pollution and traffic levels down a notch.Some of the other suggestions include the stipulation that the car-pooling service must be offered through an app. Whoever is administering the app will have to be made responsible for a proper KYC of the car owner as well as the riders before they are allowed to be part of the ecosystem.The states can add a small fee to be paid to it out of the carpooling service operations, if wanted.The new guidelines will also ensure that the states get some revenue from carpooling. This suggestion is aimed at making the state government have a vested interest in running this facility and encouraging it. There are apps already in operation, like Quick Ride and BlaBlaCar. These will have to make suitable changes to their applications once the guidelines are approved and become law in the respective states.If the app-based hail-a-cab operators like Ola and Uber wish to enter the carpooling business, they will have to create a separate platform and not include it in their existing arrangement as per these guidelines.  This policy framework is part of the larger National Mission for Transformative Mobility announced by the government earlier.  ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/govt-drafting-norms-ride-sharing-mandatory-kyc-users-limit-4-rides-day-108985?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

They claimed Zomato reduced their per delivery earning and increased the number of orders that guarantee an incentive. Delivery executives in Bengaluru have also written to Zomato opposing the new incentive scheme.",The News Minute,"Even as many restaurants stay logged out of Zomato, trouble has spilled to its delivery business as thousands of delivery executives in Bengaluru and Mumbai are protesting against the food aggregator over revised rate cards. Around 3000 delivery executives in Mumbai and another 3000 in Bengaluru have logged out of the app and have been protesting since Saturday.The bone of contention is the change in their payment systems. Delivery executives are given rate cards which define how much they will be paid per delivery and lays out incentives based on orders completed and kilometres travelled.Delivery executives claim that Zomato has reduced their per delivery earning, increased the number of orders that will earn them an incentive and has also increased the kilometres they need to travel to get additional bonus.In Bengaluru, delivery executives earlier earned Rs 40 per delivery, which has now been reduced to Rs 30. In terms of incentives, the executives were earlier paid Rs 550 as incentive for 15 deliveries on weekends. This has been changed to Rs 500 for 18 deliveries. Zomato has also allegedly increased the distance required (from 4 kms to 5.5 kms) to make workers eligible to receive ‘bonus points’.Zomato delivery executives protesting in HSR Layout, BengaluruWasim a native of Kolkata, who joined Zomato a year ago was earning Rs 34,000 -- minus fuel cost of Rs 6000 – after working for 15-16 hours a day. ""Now for the last three days, I have logged out. My wife is pregnant, my costs will further go up. It will be impossible to make a living. I have a small loan to service also. Earlier we had bonuses for every order in excess of 5km. Now this is no longer there. It is very hard to compete 20 orders in a day with the new target of 24 orders, it is impossible to get the incentive which is the most important part,” he says.The situation is similar in Mumbai. Delivery executives, who earlier got paid Rs 35 per delivery, will now be paid only Rs 25. And while they used to get Rs 240 as an incentive on completing 11 orders, this has now changed to 14 orders.Rakesh, a delivery executive in Mumbai says that they were promised earnings of up to Rs 20,000 for part time and Rs 40,000 for full time. “We now work for 12 hours and still barely earn Rs 20,000. Of that we need to spend for petrol and mobile recharge. Petrol prices are increasing. In any company, salary increases as time goes. So on what basis is Zomato reducing our earnings?” he asks.Zomato delivery executives protesting in MumbaiPrakash*, a college student who funds himself and his family says that his monthly earning will be affected by nearly Rs 5000 with the new rates.""On Thursday, I had logged in for the whole day and I made Rs 1400 on the app. Now imagine if I had to spend almost the whole day and logged out at 11 pm to make that. In the current situation, I have to deliver more orders, which would mean an additional three hours on the app to make the same amount. Do you think this is possible? If I do the same work as now, I would only make Rs 1200,” he says.Delivery executives also claim that the number of orders they have been receiving has significantly come down. And this is mainly because of the number of delivery executives Zomato has onboarded. This would mean that it takes longer for an executive to receive an order and takes even longer to complete the required number of orders to receive an incentive.Zomato delivery executives protesting in Worli, MumbaiSivanandan, another delivery executive from Mumbai claims that the company does not even help them when they meet with accidents and get injured. “Zomato says they are running under loss. But the real loss is for us – we pay for petrol, for mobile bills and even medical bills when we meet with an accident,” he adds.Several delivery executives in Bengaluru too, shared instances of them meeting with an accident resulting in severe injuries and Zomato taking no responsibility for the same.Delivery executives in Bengaluru have now written to Zomato opposing the new incentive scheme and that order distance also be reduced so that it doesn’t take them too long to deliver. They will be meeting with the company later today.Shaheed from Mumbai, however, claims that Zomato is not paying heed to their demands. Some executives were called for a meeting, but there hasn’t been any resolution.“We have given Zomato so much of our time. Our main demand is that the old rate system and incentive system be restored,” Shaheed adds.While Zomato did not specifically respond to TNM’s questions on how the new scheme will work, a company spokesperson said, “Different metrics such as base pay, user satisfaction, delivery touchpoints, minimum guarantee etc. help us appreciate our delivery partners in accordance with their efforts. Reduced average delivery time (less than 30 mins) and increased system efficiency have enabled our delivery partners to perform more deliveries in the same amount of time.”“We regret the inconvenience caused to our users and are continuously working to resume our services in the affected areas,” it added.Also read: Why 1,200+ restaurants are choosing to log off food apps like Zomato and Dineout",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/scores-zomato-delivery-executives-logout-protest-against-reduction-incentives-108998?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Thackeray said their hopes have increased with “all that the government was doing” under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He also said that it was “not right to keep waiting” for the construction of Ram temple anymore.“Our Shivsainiks have been asked to prepare to lay the first brick for Ram Temple, our hopes have increased with all that the government is doing, it’s not right to keep waiting anymore,” Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. This is the second time in just weeks that Shiv Sena chief has expressed confidence that Ram Temple would be built under Prime Minister Modi.Earlier this month, Uddhav Thackeray shared the dais with the Prime Minister at an event organised to mark the laying of the foundation stone for three metro lines in Mumbai. Addressing the gathering there, he had made a similar remark and said: “I am assuring you in the presence of Prime Minister that Ram Mandir will be built under his leadership in Ayodhya.” Shiv Sena chief further said that all those things which he had been promising to implement for so many years have now been fulfilled by PM Modi.“I am proud that Article 370 has been abrogated. This promise has been fulfilled. I am sure that we will build the Ram temple in Ayodhya,” Thackeray said. The confidence of BJP supporters has shot up after Prime Minister Modi abrogated special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370. This was one of the key promises that BJP and Shiv Sena had been making for decades.While the BJP was expected to act on Article 370 — it figured prominently in its election manifesto for Lok Sabha elections — that the government would remove this so soon was not anticipated. With the abolition of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and triple talaq, Modi dared to go where no politician could in the past, considering the possible political repercussions. These bold moves of Modi have sent a signal that his government can deliver on its promises. Ayodhya dispute is currently before the Supreme Court which is hearing the matter on a daily basis.Prime Minister Modi has maintained on several occasions that the matter is before the Supreme Court and his government would wait for the court to arrive at a conclusion. Thackeray’s increased mentions of the Ram Temple comes just ahead of the Assembly polls in the state scheduled for later this year.

1285,MIT researchers create ML-driven tool to predict cardiovascular death,"Researchers at MIT have developed a machine learning system, 'RiskCardio', to better predict death caused by cardiovascular issues that block or reduce blood flow. The system uses the patient's first 15 minutes of raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and places them into different risk categories. It can predict whether a person will die within 30 days or up to a year.",Engadget,"AI's ability to predict threats to your health could soon include deadly heart conditions.  Researchers at MIT's CSAIL have developed a machine learning system, RiskCardio, that can estimate the risk of death due to cardiovascular issues that block or reduce blood flow.  All it needs is a 15-minute ECG reading -- from there, it gauges the danger based on the sets of consecutive beats in the sample. If the data is captured within 15 minutes of an event, RiskCardio can determine whether or not someone will die within 30 days, or even up to a year later.The approach is based on the notion that greater variability between heartbeats reflects greater risk.  Scientists trained the machine learning system using historical data for patient outcomes.  If a patient survived, their heartbeats were deemed relatively normal; if a patient died, their heart activity was considered risky.  The ultimate risk score comes by averaging the prediction from each set of consecutive heartbeats.There's plenty of work to be done, including refining the training data to account for more ages, ethnic backgrounds and genders.  It clearly needs to be accurate when mistakes could have dangerous consequences.  If RiskCardio does enter service, though, it could prove vital to health care.  Doctors could quickly assess a patient's health and decide on an appropriate level of treatment.  CSAIL also hopes it can help understand less-than-clear scenarios by running poorly-labeled data  through the system.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/15/mit-machine-learning-cardiovascular-death-risk/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1303,Kim Jong-un invited Trump to North Korea in letter: Report,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un invited US President Donald Trump to visit the country in a letter sent in August amid stalled denuclearisation talks, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday, citing diplomatic sources. Kim spoke of his ""willingness"" for a third summit in the letter, which was reportedly sent in the third week of August.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declined to comment on a newspaper report that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had invited him to visit Pyongyang and said conditions were not ready yet for such a visit. “The relationship is very good but I don’t want to comment on that,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked whether Kim had invited him to North Korea. A South Korean newspaper on Monday cited diplomatic sources as saying Kim had invited him to visit the North Korean capital in a letter sent in August amid stalled denuclearization talks. Trump said he would “probably not” be inclined to visit North Korea in the short term, but did not rule out an eventual visit. “I would do it ... at some time in a later future, and depending on what happens I’m sure he’ll love coming to the United States also. But, no, I don’t think it’s ready for that. I think we have a ways to go yet,” Trump said. Kim, in the letter sent in the third week of August, spoke of his “willingness” for a third summit and extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pyongyang, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source. Trump on Aug. 9 said he had received a “very beautiful letter” from Kim. But U.S. officials have not said anything about a second letter in August. Trump and Kim have met three times since June last year to discuss ways to resolve a crisis over North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, but substantive progress has been scant.  Their first two meetings were formal summits, the second of which, in Vietnam in February, broke down after they failed to narrow a gap between U.S. demands for North Korean denuclearization and a North Korean demand for relief from sanctions. They met for a third time on June 30 in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas and agreed to restart working-level talks but that has not happened. Since the June meeting, North Korea has several times tested short-range missiles. The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. An unidentified director-general for U.S. affairs at North Korea’s foreign ministry said on Monday he hoped a “good meeting” with working-level U.S. officials would take place “in a few weeks”. But whether a meeting would lead to a “crisis or chance” was up to the United States, the official said, calling for a more flexible approach.  “The discussion of denuclearization may be possible when threats and hurdles endangering our system security and obstructing our development are clearly removed beyond all doubt,” the official said in a statement carried by North Korea’s official KCNA news agency. A spokeswoman for the State Department said the United States welcomed the North Korean commitment to resume negotiations in late September, but it had no meetings to announce. “We are prepared to have those discussions at a time and place to be agreed,” she said. The spokeswoman did not respond when asked if the United States was willing to offer any easing of sanctions or security guarantees.  South Korea’s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, asked about the newspaper report, said there were “detailed explanations about such a letter” but declined to elaborate.  Kang said it could be “too much to expect” that Trump and Kim would meet before any working-level talks.  “No agreement was reached between the two leaders in Hanoi even after working-level negotiations,” Kang told a parliamentary panel.  “For the sake of the success of another summit, their working-level teams should meet and have primary discussions on the outcome of the summit,” Kang said.

1322,"Quinton de Kock reminds me of Brian Lara, Kumar Sangakkara: Gambhir","Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir has said that South Africa wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock reminds him of Kumar Sangakkara and Brian Lara. ""He is one of those gorgeous left-handers which I always aspired to be but could never be. Hopefully, he delivers as a captain but not at the cost of curtailing fluidity of his batting,” Gambhir added.",Cricket Country,"The grace and flamboyance with which Quinton de Kock bats reminds Gautam Gambhir of the great Brian Lara and Sangakkara, the former India opener wrote in his column for the Times of India Saturday. Gambhir, who retired from international cricket last December, admitted de Kock’s style is the type which he wouldn’t have mind implementing in his own game during his playing days.ALSO READ: Five South Africa players to watch out forAs de Kock gets ready to lead South Africa for the first time in T20Is, a lot rides on how he goes about in this series. With Faf du Plessis rested, De Kock is most likely candidate to take over the reins, one who is expected to take the lead the team to Australia next year for the T20 World Cup.Team Director Enoch Nkwe recently said that it’s about time South Africa look beyond du Plessis. The key is to blood youngsters going into the T20 World Cup and as de Kock gears up to lead a fairly young side in India following their World Cup debacle, his stiff test starts right away. South Africa are hurting and de Kock would be keen eager to making his IPL experience count against one of the toughest teams to beat on their home turf.“In the context of South Africa’s tour of India, the visitors may relate to this as this is their first international engagement after a forgetful World Cup campaign. I like Quinton de Kock. He is one of those gorgeous left-handers which I always aspired to be but could never be. In full flow, he reminds me of Kumara Sangakkara and Brian Lara. Hopefully, he delivers as a captain but not at the cost of curtailing fluidity of his batting,” Gambhir said.The former India opener feels India would fancy playing against a relatively low-on-experience side on their home turf. India are yet to win an T20I against South Africa at home, their last meeting ending in the Proteas beating them 2-0 in 2015. The three-match series opener will take place on Sunday in Dharamsala, where South Africa beat India the last time after they chased down 200.Gambhir however believes that time with the likes of promising youngsters such as Manish Pandey and Shreyas Iyer in the side, India are better equipped and that the series also gives the opportunity to these young talents an opportunity to cement their place in the team, keeping an eye of the T20 World Cup in Australia next year.“India will be licking their lips at the idea of taking on a young, work-in-progress opposition. Dharamsala is not a very big arena. And being at the higher altitude, the science guys tell me that the ball travels faster because the air is thin. All this means there will be plenty of boundaries if the pitch is good for batting,” Gambhir reckoned.“It is another opportunity for young Indian batsmen to cement their place in the side. Manish Pandey looks much younger than his age of 29. Shreyas Iyer explained enough in the West Indies that he is a great deal more than the ‘South Bombay’ swag. KL Rahul is a force in white-ball format. Rishabh Pant is always exciting but he has to watch his back as my favourite Sanju Samson is throwing some serious challenges at him. It is an exciting series as there are a lot of individual battles going on considering the T20 World Cup next year.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/india-vs-south-africa-quinton-de-kocks-batting-possesses-shades-of-brian-lara-kumar-sangakkara-gautam-gambhir-891108?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1370,"UK PM likens himself to Incredible Hulk, vows Oct 31 Brexit","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to the comic book character The Incredible Hulk and stressed his determination to take Britain out of the European Union on October 31. ""The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,"" he said. ""Hulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound... and that is the case for this country,"" Johnson added.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to the comic book character The Incredible Hulk in a newspaper interview where he stressed his determination to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31. The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported that Johnson said he would find a way to circumvent a recent parliament vote ordering him to delay Brexit rather than take Britain out of the EU without a transition deal. “The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,” Johnson was quoted as saying. “Hulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be - and that is the case for this country. We will come out on October 31.” Britain’s parliament has repeatedly rejected the exit deal Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May negotiated with the EU, and this month rejected leaving without a deal - angering many  Britons who voted to leave the bloc more than three years ago. Johnson wants to harness that anger to win a majority in an early national election, but his efforts to call one have so far been thwarted by opposition parties who want to first ensure Britain cannot leave the EU without a deal on Oct. 31. The Liberal Democrats party, which has 18 seats in Britain’s 650-seat parliament, on Sunday made its bid for the votes of those who want remain in the EU, toughening its anti-Brexit stance to say it would stop the exit process if it won power in an election, and would reject any Brexit deal Johnson struck. “If people put into government as a majority government, the ‘Stop Brexit’ party, then stopping Brexit is exactly what people will get,” party leader Jo Swinson said. Johnson has said he wants to negotiate a new deal that does not involve a ‘backstop’, which would potentially tie Britain against its will to EU rules after it leaves in order to avoid checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The EU has so far insisted on the backstop, and Britain has not presented any detailed alternative. Nonetheless, Johnson said he was “very confident” ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday. “There’s a very, very good conversation going on about how to address the issues of the Northern Irish border. A huge amount of progress is being made,” Johnson told the Mail on Sunday, without giving details. The opposition Labour Party called for more details on what Johnson was proposing. Johnson drew parallels between Britain’s situation in Brexit talks and the frustrations felt by fictional scientist Bruce Banner, who when enraged turned into the super-strong Incredible Hulk, frequently leaving behind a trail of destruction. “Banner might be bound in manacles, but when provoked he would explode out of them,” he said. The Sunday Times reported that Johnson’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings had raised the idea of suspending parliament for a second time. Parliament is currently suspended until Oct. 14 - a decision which is being challenged in the courts by those who say it is an attempt to block debate on Brexit. On Saturday, former Conservative minister Sam Gyimah said he was switching to the pro-EU Liberal Democrat party in protest at Johnson’s Brexit policies and political style, and Swinson said she believed she could win an election. But, polling suggests the Liberal Democrats, who in the party’s modern form have never won more than 62 seats at an election, are unlikely to find themselves in a position to stop Brexit outright. Polls published late on Saturday painted a conflicting picture of the Conservative Party’s political fortunes under Johnson. A poll conducted by Opinium for the Observer newspaper showed Conservative support rose to 37% from 35% over the past week, while Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour held at 25% and Liberal Democrat support dropped to 16% from 17%. Support for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party remained at 13%. However, a separate poll by ComRes for the Sunday Express put Conservative support at just 28%, down from 30% and only a shade ahead of Labour at 27%. ComRes said just 12% of the more than 2,000 people it survey thought Britain’s parliament could be trusted to do the right thing for the country.

The inner circle was found to be 30 yards, while it should have been 25.15 yards as per women's T20I rules.",Cricket Australia,"Play was delayed in bizarre circumstances during Australia’s T20 against the West Indies in Barbados when officials were made aware that the dimensions of the playing surface were incorrect.After Australia spearhead Megan Schutt bowled Windies opener Britney Cooper for a duck with the fourth delivery of the match, the umpires came together and signalled for assistance from the stands.It soon became apparent that the umpires believed the white markers that provide the boundary for the inner fielding circle were too far from the pitch, so the third official and the venue’s curator – carrying a measuring tape - were summoned onto the field.Sure enough, the first marker they inspected at backward square leg was deemed to be too far from the pitch, and a five-minute delay followed while the remaining markers were checked and brought in, much to the bemusement of the waiting players.The inner circle in women’s T20Is must have a radius of 23m (25.15 yards), as opposed to men’s matches where the distance is 27.43m (30 yards).During the re-measuring process, umpire Verdayne Smith was heard to say: ""He measured 30 to start, and I told him it was 25"".Speaking after the match, Australia captain Meg Lanning said allrounder Jess Jonassen first suspected that the markers were too far away from the pitch.""The inner circle was a little too deep on one side"" Lanning said.""JJ (Jonassen) was at point and she came up to me and said she felt like she was really deep.""So I asked the umpire and when we had a look it was a couple metres too deep, it was the men's circle but once we got that fixed it was all right.""When play resumed, a second head-scratching moment came just two balls later.Australia believed they had Kyshona Knight run out after an ill-judged quick single, with Jess Jonassen’s accurate throw from point enabling keeper Alyssa Healy to whip the bails off with the opener visibly short of her crease.But the Australians were then left puzzled when square leg umpire Jonathan Blades failed to react.As the official approached the stumps to replace the bails, Australia allrounder Ashleigh Gardner asked if there had been a run out, at which point he gestured towards his ears to indicate he had not heard an appeal.After a quick 'howzat' from the tourists, he responded by raising his finger, with Knight forced to depart for one as the Windies slumped to 2-1 after one prolonged over.""She was out, but the umpire thought we hadn't appealed so he hadn't given her out yet,"" Lanning said.""We thought we had, we thought she was so far out we didn’t need a massive appeal, we just appealed a little bit, but we definitely did and once we sorted that out we could all move on.""The umpiring was in focus again at the end of the 10th over when Sheneta Grimmond survived an attempted stumping from Healy off the bowling of Jonassen, with replays showing the batter’s foot was clearly in the air when Healy removed the bails. But with no TV umpire available for this match, Grimmond was able to continue her innings.Australia are playing three T20Is in Barbados as they ramp up their preparations for the T20 World Cup on home soil next February and March.Fans in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea can stream the series live and free on cricket.com.au and the CA Live App, while fans elsewhere can watch on the West Indies Cricket YouTube channel.CommBank Tour of the West IndiesAustralia squad: Meg Lanning (c), Rachael Haynes (vc), Erin Burns, Nicola Carey, Ashleigh Gardner, Heather Graham, Alyssa Healy, Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Tayla Vlaeminck, Georgia WarehamWest Indies ODI squad: Stafanie Taylor (c), Hayley Matthews (vc), Reniece Boyce, Afy Fletcher, Chinelle Henry, Shamilia Connell, Stacy Ann King, Natasha McLean, Kycia Knight, Kyshona Knight, Anisa Mohammed, Karishma Ramharack, Shabika GajnabiOne-Day Internationals* *ICC Women's Championship matchesFirst ODI: Australia won by 178 runsSecond ODI: Australia won by 151 runsThird ODI: Australia won by eight wicketsTwenty20 InternationalsSeptember 14: First T20I, Kensington Oval, BarbadosSeptember 16: Second T20I, Kensington Oval, BarbadosSeptember 18: Third T20I, Kensington Oval, Barbados",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/first-t20-inner-fielding-circule-measurement-umpires-australia-west-indies-kensington-oval-barbados/2019-09-15?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1403,Idea for Drivezy came after my new car's accident: Co-founder Ashwarya,"Vehicle leasing startup Drivezy's Co-founder Ashwarya Pratap Singh in an interview said the idea of the startup emerged after his new car met with an accident. ""I barely used it...and I spent a good part of salary to maintain it,"" he said. ""The accident made me realise that a lot of people might be facing the same conundrum,"" he added.",YourStory,"The concept of ridesharing did not find many takers in India until recently. The idea started picking up, courtesy cab aggregating platforms like Ola and Uber.It was during this time that Ashwarya Pratap Singh’s new Ford Figo met with an accident. Drivezy FoundersThis was the lightbulb moment for Ashwarya, who was joined by his college friends Hemant Kumar Sah, Vasant Verma, and Amit Sahu to come up with a new concept: JustRide. The platform allowed people to rent cars to self-drive.Initially, they began with leasing around 250 cars. Today, the platform, which has been re-branded as Drivezy, has expanded its services to include 4,000 cars and 16,000 two-wheelers. The team also launched operations in San Francisco in the US in August this year. And now, the team intends to expand its services to 10 cities in the US with a fleet of 1,000 cars by next year. On an average, a car on the Drivezy platform today clocks 120-130 kilometers per day, while bikes clock 85-90 kilometres every day. They claim to have a 234 percent increase in listed asset base. Early this month, Drivezy also entered into a strategic partnership with Gurugram-based hospitality chain OYO to park their vehicles at its properties. “We have already stationed more than 1,200 bikes at Oyo hotels in Bengaluru and Hyderabad,” says Ashwarya. While Drivezy seems to be growing at a breakneck speed, Ashwarya believes the concept of sharing in the mobility space was a problem waiting to be solved. He says cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Mumbai have a major problem of infrastructure, traffic, and parking. He explains that they believe the increasing penetration of internet in India, coupled with the need for cost-effective and sustainable mobility will nudge millions of urban Indians towards vehicle sharing. “We shall add another 70,000 bikes to our platform and take our services to 21 cities by next year. To consummate the high demand, we have also begun franchising our brand across India. Our franchise initiative has taken off a great start,” Ashwarya says. “We have raised an investment of $1.5 million from franchise investors and have already established 12 units in three cities. The franchises will play a significant role in our expansion plan as we look to establish 100 franchise units. We have mobilised assets worth $5 million through our franchises, and over the next quarter we shall enlist assets worth $25 million through the franchise channel,” he adds.

According to reports, a police complaint was lodged against the duo, accusing them of negligence in the treatment of the 11-month-old Siberian Husky. A post-mortem was also conducted on the Husky and the report is awaited. The two veterinarians - Dr Rajith and Dr Lakshmi Srinivas - run a private animal clinic in Banjara Hills road and have been booked under Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code. If proven guilty, the doctors face a jail term for up to five years. The nine pet dogs of the chief minister are reportedly taken care of by canine handler Asif Ali Khan. On September 10, the Siberian Husky stopped eating and Khan took him to the two doctors. The vets prescribed medicines but Husky's health deteriorated and it was taken to the animal clinic of the vets on Banjara roads where it died. Khan alleged negligence on part of doctors and filed a case with the police.

1406,College said 'Wear long kurtis for good marriage proposals': Hyd student,"A student from Hyderabad's St Francis College for Women has shared videos showing guards stopping girls from entering the premises for wearing kurtis that were ""an inch or less above the knee"". She added that college authorities said ""a long kurti would get [them] good marriage proposals"". ""We can't...watch their internalised patriarchy...dictate our beliefs,"" her Facebook post read.",The News Minute,"Moral policing continues unabated at Hyderabad’s St Francis College for Women, an arts and science college in the city’s Begumpet area. On Friday, multiple students were halted at the gates of the institute because their kurti was an inch above their knees, leading to an altercation with security staff.Videos of the incident on Friday showed security staff tugging at the kurtis of students and asking them what they were wearing. A video shot from behind a gate also showed the security guard holding it open only for one person to pass through, and in another, a woman security guard can be seen scanning a group of girls and deciding who to send in —all of this, because the height of the kurti was not as prescribed.Another video showed Principal Sister Sandra Horta questioning a group of students whose kurtas were above their knees. In the video, a few of the girls can be heard telling the Principal that they cannot keep changing wardrobe as everyone cannot afford it The problem overall dress codes began at St Francis at the end of July, when the college issued a bizarre circular making it mandatory for all students to wear kurtis that touch the knee or are longer, from August 1. The circular was sent on the college WhatsApp group, where the students usually receive their schedules and timetables forwarded from the management.Students TNM spoke to allege that teachers often make them stand up in class, check the length of their kurti and only then decide to give them attendance for that particular lecture. If the length of their kurti isn’t satisfactory, the student stand to lose attendance for a lecture they attended, they alleged. One student also alleged that in cases where a student did not follow the dress code, then the girl’s parents had to apologise to the principal. Also read: 'Wear knee-length kurti or go home': Students allege moral policing at Hyderabad collegeAccording to Ramya*, an undergraduate student at the college, female security guards were brought in to the college last week, and for three days, students were reprimanded if their kurti was not the ‘right’ length, but they were allowed to enter. However, things came to a head on Friday, when they were tugged at, pushed, and humiliated. “The first three days they allowed us to go in. They just shouted at us saying ‘what is this’, chased us and pulled us back, but they didn't stop us from going in. But on Friday, they started to stop because apparently they had given a warning,” she says.Ramya says that this rule was brought in mid-year, and some students did not have the financial ability to buy a new wardrobe that conformed to the new rules. Furthermore, Ramya says that while some teachers support the students, students haven’t been allowed to have a constructive conversation with the management, but have been allegedly threatened about their attendance and their future. ""People are getting angrier by the minute. We didn't want anyone to touch us. Now, the management is okay with these people behaving with us the way they are. And they believe it's okay because it's a woman and not a male security guard, so they can do that,” alleges Ramya.  According to Vandana*, another student, the principal said that the guards were there for a reason, and that students had to follow what they said, and not waste her time. “We don't want to be a part of an institution that wants to institutionalise this kind of patriarchy. Speaking to us in such a tone, giving us subliminal messages that we are arousing males, I don't think is a very appropriate environment or a good environment for all of us to be in. I don't think it helps our intellectual development either,” Ramya alleges.The students have decided to hold a protest on Monday against the college's dress code.Despite repeated messages and calls, the Principal did not react. ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hyderabad-s-st-francis-college-posts-guards-enforce-dress-code-check-length-kurti-108918?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1411,Iran rejects US claim it was behind attacks on Saudi oil facilities,"Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi on Sunday dismissed US claim that Iran was behind drone attacks which hit two oil facilities in Saudi Arabia as ""pointless"". ""Such useless accusations...are meaningless and not comprehensible,"" he added. Blaming Iran, US State Secretary Mike Pompeo had said, ""Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply.""",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran rejected accusations by the United States that it was behind attacks on Saudi oil plants that risk disrupting world energy supplies and warned on Sunday that U.S. bases and aircraft carriers in the region were in range of its missiles. Yemen’s Houthi group claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks that knocked out more than half of Saudi oil output or more than 5% of global supply, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the assault was the work of Iran, a Houthi ally. The drone strikes on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, including the world’s biggest petroleum processing facility, were expected to send oil prices up $5-10 per barrel on Monday as tensions rise in the Middle East. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the U.S. allegation as “pointless”. A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned that the Islamic Republic was ready for “full-fledged” war. “All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,” the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying. State oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day, at a time when Aramco is trying to ready itself for what is expected to be the world’s largest share sale. Aramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take “weeks, not days”. Another source briefed on the developments said Saudi oil exports would continue to run as normal this week thanks to large storage in the kingdom. But it remains unclear how long the oil production shut down will continue, because the damage to the infrastructure “was big” and could not be fixed overnight, the source added. Traders and analysts said crude may spike to as high as $100 if Riyadh fails to quickly bring back supply.  The kingdom, the world’s top oil exporter, ships more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day. Riyadh said it would compensate for the loss by drawing on its stocks which stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data. The United States said it was also ready to tap emergency oil reserves if needed. The Saudi bourse closed down 1.1% with banking and petrochemical shares taking the biggest hit. Saudi petrochemical firms announced a significant reduction in feedstock supplies.  “Abqaiq is the nerve center of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24-48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,” Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters. According to U.S. government information, 15 structures at Abqaiq suffered damage on their west-northwest facing sides. Pompeo said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim rival Iran. “Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” he said. Some Iraqi media outlets said the attack came from there. Baghdad denied this on Sunday and vowed to punish anyone using Iraq, where Iran-backed paramilitary groups wield increasing power, as a launchpad for attacks. Kuwait, which borders Iraq, said it was investigating the sighting of a drone over its territory and coordinating with Saudi Arabia and other countries. The cabinet said the prime minister ordered tighter security at vital installations. Riyadh accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil pumping stations and the Shaybah oilfield, charges Tehran denies. It has not yet blamed any party for Saturday’s strike, but linked it to a recent series of attacks on Saudi oil assets and crude tankers in Gulf waters. Riyadh says Iran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny. Regional tensions have escalated since Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Saturday’s attacks and called on all parties to exercises restraint and prevent any escalation. The European Union warned that the strikes posed a real threat to regional security, Britain called them a “reckless attempt” to disrupt global oil supplies and France said such actions could only worsen “risk of conflict”. Iran’s ally Turkey called for the avoidance of “provocative steps”. U.S.-IRAN TALKS The attack comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was possible at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month. Tehran ruled out talks until sanctions are lifted. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway did not rule out a possible meeting between the two but told “Fox News Sunday” that the strikes “did not help” that prospect.  Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Trump that Riyadh was ready to deal with “terrorist aggression”. The Saudi-led coalition has responded to past Houthi attacks with air strikes on the group’s military sites in Yemen. The conflict has been in military stalemate for years. The alliance has air supremacy but has come under scrutiny over civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis that has left millions facing starvation. The Houthis, more adept at guerrilla warfare, have increased attacks on Saudi cities, thwarting peace efforts. The United Arab Emirates, Riyadh’s main partner in the alliance, has reduced its presence in Yemen due to concern over rising Iran tensions and Western criticism of the war, leaving Riyadh to try to neutralize the Houthi threat along its border.  Iran’s foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said Washington and its allies were “stuck in Yemen” and that blaming Tehran “won’t end the disaster”.

It is accessible from a number of places, including the ""Your Orders"" page, on product pages, or through Amazon customer support.",TechCrunch,"Amazon  is testing an easier way for people to leave product feedback with the launch of one-tap ratings. The change is meant to encourage those who don’t have the time, energy or interest in writing reviews to still share their opinion about the product, which benefits the larger Amazon community of shoppers who are reliant on ratings and reviews to make better purchasing decisions.If you have access to the new experiment, you’ll be able to just tap once to leave your star rating on any item, without having to fill out additional fields like a review title and written review, as previously required.You’ll also be able to access these one-tap ratings from a number of places, including the “Your Orders” page on Amazon where you can tap the “Write a Review” button; by going to a product page directly; or by responding to solicitations sent to you from Amazon or those that appear on the homepage when you log in.The process of leaving a one-tap review is extremely simple — you just select the star rating and you’ll then see a green checkmark confirming the submission.Only those one-tap ratings from Verified Purchases will contribute to the product’s overall star rating. You’re also able to expand on your feedback later on, if you choose, by adding a review, photos or video.The new feature could go a long way toward being able to collect feedback from a larger number of online consumers, as many don’t bother with writing reviews. It also could help balance out the ratings with feedback from real shoppers, as opposed to those who may have been incentivized or paid to leave reviews.That’s against Amazon policy, of course, and is a practice the retailer has been cracking down on for years — including by outright banning incentivized reviews, by way of multiple lawsuits, fines and through suspensions of seller accounts. But there are still services out there offering to boost a product’s Amazon reviews through less-than-official tactics. And there are products on Amazon that continue to have suspiciously positive reviews, ranging from weight loss pills to Bluetooth headphones.Flooding those products with legit reviews from real customers could bring about a more accurate rating, even if Amazon isn’t able to fully flush the scammers from its review community.The new ratings test is showing both online and in the mobile app worldwide. Not everyone will see the feature at this time, as some customers will be in a control group.Amazon confirmed the new feature is an experiment, not a public launch.“We are testing a feature that allows customers to leave feedback easily while also helping shoppers get authentic customer ratings on products from a broader set of shoppers,” an Amazon spokesperson said.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/13/amazon-tests-a-one-tap-review-system-for-product-feedback/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Boeing has already provided over 3 lakh pages of documents, reports said.",Reuters," (In SEPT 12 story, corrects name of European Union Aviation Safety Agency from European Aviation and Space Agency in paragraph 10) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress on Thursday asked Boeing Co’s chief executive to make several employees available for interviews as part of a congressional probe into the design, development and certification of 737 MAX aircraft involved in two crashes that killed 346 people. House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio and Representative Rick Larsen, who chairs the aviation subcommittee, said in a statement that while Boeing has provided substantial documents and shared senior management’s perspective, “it’s important to the committee’s investigation to hear from relevant Boeing employees.”  The committee plans another Boeing hearing in the coming weeks and previously asked whistleblowers to come forward with any information about the plane’s development. Boeing has provided more than 300,000 pages of documents, a person briefed on the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Boeing said in a statement it was “deeply disappointed the committee chose to release private correspondence given our extensive cooperation to date. We will continue to be transparent and responsive to the committee.” The 737 MAX, Boeing’s best-selling jet, was grounded globally in March, days after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that followed a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. A total of 346 people died in the two crashes. Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation’s inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX as well as how the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies new aircraft. Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights into December as a result of the MAX grounding, including American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines, while Southwest Airlines Co has canceled flights into early January.  CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at an investor conference on Wednesday that the company is still targeting “early fourth quarter for getting the airplane back up in the air” but added that “ultimately return-to-service timing will be determined by the regulator.” The FAA has repeatedly said it will not certify the plane to fly again until it is safe to do so. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said on Tuesday it “intends to conduct its own test flights separate from, but in full coordination with, the FAA. The test flights are not scheduled yet, the date will depend on the development schedule of Boeing.” Muilenburg said it is possible not all regulators around the world will concurrently approve the MAX to fly again. Boeing has said it plans to conduct a certification test flight in the “September time frame” but Muilenburg did not give a specific date when asked on Wednesday. Some officials do not expect the 737 MAX to actually resume flights until early 2020. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 1 that a Boeing briefing in August was cut short by U.S., European and other regulators who complained the company failed to answer specific questions about modifications in the operation of MAX flight-control computers. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed frustration with the lack of some answers from Boeing.

1425,New iPhones may contain hardware to charge other wireless devices,"The 2019 lineup of iPhone may contain necessary hardware for enabling bilateral charging to let the phones wirelessly charge other Qi-compatible wireless devices, as per Australian iPhone information leaker Sonny Dickson. Apple might have reportedly kept the feature disabled within the phones' software. However, Dickson said he was ""uncertain whether this was removed prior to final production"".",Engadget,"Apple's new iPhones may include a hidden feature. Citing ""reliable sources,"" frequent Apple leaker Sonny Dickson says all three new iPhone models include the necessary hardware for bilateral charging, a feature that would allow the phones to wirelessly charge other Qi-compatible devices such as the Apple Watch. Apple, however, has reportedly disabled the feature within the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max's software. Dickson doesn't say why the company did this, which adds another wrinkle to an already interesting saga.Reliable sources are saying iPhone 11 and 11 Pro do include the hardware for bilateral charging, but that it is software disabled. Uncertain whether this was removed prior to final production run.Ahead of Tuesday's launch, bilateral charging was one of the things that seemed a sure addition to the iPhone's feature list. Both Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, two of the most accurate sources of pre-release Apple information, said the new iPhones would include the feature. Then, just days before the event, both reversed course.While it's possible Apple could enable the feature in the future (if, in fact, it's there), it seems unlikely. Alongside the iPhone 11, there were rumors Apple planned to announce a Tile-like tracker called Apple Tags on Tuesday. We didn't get Apple Tags on Tuesday, but, at least in that case, there's information on the company's website that suggests they're on their way. There's nothing like that for reverse charging.While mostly a vanity feature on Android phones like the Galaxy S10, bilateral charging has potential utility on the iPhone. Unlike USB-C, Apple's Lightning port doesn't support reverse charging, meaning you can't plug another device into the iPhone to charge it. Additionally, a lot of iPhone users own an Apple Watch and AirPods, and would likely appreciate a way to charge them in a pinch. We probably won't have to wait long to see if there's truth to the rumor. Next week, we should find out if the iPhone 11 has the hardware once groups like iFixit start taking apart the phone.

1427,Pak singer who threatened PM Modi with snakes faces 2-year jail,"A Pakistani singer who threatened PM Narendra Modi with snakes and an alligator in a video faces two-year jail for violating the country's Wildlife Act, Pakistani Wildlife Protection officials said. The officials added that the Act prohibits turning such species into pets. ""See what I've prepared for you...these friends of mine will feast on you,"" she said in the video.",RT,"Rabi Pirzada, a Pakistani pop singer and TV host, faces a fine and up to two years in jail after a clip of her cuddling a giant snake while denouncing New Delhi for revoking Kashmir's autonomy gained traction online.In the video, which was originally posted on the singer’s YouTube channel on September 2 and later picked up by local TV, Pirzada berates Modi for “harassing Kashmiris” and says her reptile friends will be special “gifts” for him.“See what I have prepared for you. So get ready to die in hell. Okay? And these friends of mine will feast on you,” the singer says in the clip before introducing her menacing-looking friends, including an alligator.The video, which was allegedly filmed in the singer’s beauty salon in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan’s Punjab province, has since racked up almost 100,000 views, making headlines in both Indian and Pakistani media.However, it was not until this week that the Punjab Wildlife Protection and Parks Department launched an inquiry into the starlet for keeping exotic animals – including pythons and an alligator – at her salon.The Pakistani Wildlife Act prohibits keeping animals like these as pets, Wildlife Protection official Sohail Ashraf said, as quoted by Pakistan’s News International, adding that no permit exists that could be obtained to legalize their ownership. The official said that Pirzada is now looking at up to two years in jail for violating the law, adding that legal proceedings were launched after she repeatedly flaunted exotic animals on social media and her infamous clip was aired on TV.However, the singer herself insists that it was her anti-Modi rant, not her affection for reptiles, that got her into trouble.“For all those sick minded who r reminding me to get Lisence, where was wildlife before my threat to Modi? Can’t u see y they did this,” she tweeted on Saturday.Pirzada, a native of the Pakistan-administrated part of disputed Kashmir and daughter of an army officer, has openly voiced her criticism of India’s decision to integrate part of Kashmir under its control, and has recently staged a ‘Save Kashmir’ rally, prompting accusations that she’s on Islamabad’s payroll. Pirzada denies taking orders from the Pakistani government, claiming she has received “zero support” from the authorities. There are several videos of Pirzada playing with snakes on her YouTube channel, including a two-month old clip called ‘snake charmer’. Pirzada claims that she has always been fascinated with snakes, which are “better than so many friends who are there to betray you.” The authorities are now trying to locate the animals, as the singer reportedly directed them to the wrong address. Once recovered, they will be handed over to local zoos, officials said.Think your friends would be interested?

1435,US blames Iran for drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused Iran of leading attacks on Saudi oil facilities that have cut the kingdom's output roughly in half. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group has claimed responsibility for the attacks on the two facilities, including the world's biggest petroleum processing facility. The US State Department has declined to provide any evidence to support Pompeo's claim.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday accused Iran of leading attacks on Saudi oil plants that have cut the kingdom’s output roughly in half, as he ruled out Yemeni involvement and denounced Tehran for engaging in false diplomacy. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed credit for the attacks on two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, including the world’s biggest petroleum processing facility. Pompeo, however, said on Twitter that there was no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. “Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy,” Pompeo said, referring to Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif.  “Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” he added. The State Department declined to provide any evidence to bolster Pompeo’s claim. “We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran’s attacks,” Pompeo said, warning that the Trump administration would work with its allies to make sure Iran was “held accountable for its aggression.” The tweets signaled a more hawkish stance in Washington toward Tehran, following signs of a possible thaw in relations between the two nations after months of escalation.  Last year, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 pact that aimed to keep a lid on Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and he has imposed a series of sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. But in recent weeks, Trump has said he would be open to meeting with Rouhani, perhaps on the sidelines of the United National General Assembly in New York later this month. Pompeo has said such talks could take place without any preconditions. Rouhani, for his part, has said that Tehran, which denies seeking nuclear weapons, would not talk to the United States until Washington lifts the sanctions. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, a close Trump ally and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Saturday’s attacks showed Iran was not interested in peace and was instead pursuing nuclear weapons and regional dominance.    “It is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,” Graham said on Twitter. Others cast doubt on Pompeo’s allegations. “This is such irresponsible simplification and it’s how we get into dumb wars,” Democratic Senator and committee member Chris Murphy tweeted. “Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it’s just not as simple as Houthis=Iran.” Washington’s allies overseas will want to see solid evidence of Iran’s involvement, said Suzanne Maloney, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. “It’s credible that the Iranians had something to do with this,” said Maloney. “We’ll have to wait and see how they’ll (the administration) marshal the evidence.” Saturday’s attacks follow earlier cross-border attacks on Saudi oil installations and on oil tankers in Gulf waters. Saudi Arabia, which leads a Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis, has blamed regional rival Shi’ite Iran for previous attacks. Tehran has denied the allegations. Riyadh also accuses Iran of arming the Houthis, a charge denied both by the group and Tehran. The White House said the United States was committed to keeping oil markets well-supplied in the wake of the attack and the U.S. Energy Department said the administration could release oil from strategic reserves if necessary. The attacks on the two facilities cut Saudi Arabia’s crude oil supply by around 5.7 million barrels per day or about 50% of its output.

1442,Criticism never made me feel bitter or hostile: Kangana,"Kangana Ranaut has said that one cannot ignore the importance of speaking against issues like nepotism, sexual abuse and pay disparity and that the criticism she has received never made her feel bitter or hostile.

""I always keep a check on my intention when I raise a voice against anything critical. Because I took names while starting the conversation on nepotism, sexual abuse, pay disparity or ill-treatment that budding actors face, things always went against my career.

1460,Saudi shuts down half its oil output after drone attacks: Reports,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly shut down half of its oil output following drone attacks on Aramco plants. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi group said it deployed 10 drones in the attacks on two plants, including the world's biggest oil processing facility. The shutdown amounts to a loss of about 5 million barrels per day, about 5% of the world's daily oil production.",Reuters,"RIYADH/DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group said it attacked two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry on Saturday, knocking out more than half the Kingdom’s output, in a move expected to send oil prices soaring and increase tensions in the Middle East. The attacks will cut the kingdom’s output by 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd), according to a statement from state-run oil company Saudi Aramco, or more than 5% of global oil supply.  The pre-dawn strikes follow earlier cross-border attacks on Saudi oil installations and on oil tankers in Gulf waters, but these were the most brazen yet, temporarily crippling much of the nation’s production capacity. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter, shipping more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day, and for years has served as the supplier of last resort to markets.  While the Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack,  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put the blame squarely on Iran, writing on Twitter that there was “no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.”  “Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” Pompeo said. Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told U.S. President Donald Trump by telephone that Riyadh had the will and capability “to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,” according to Saudi state news agency SPA. The United States condemned the attacks and Trump told the crown prince that Washington was ready to work with the kingdom to guarantee its security, according to the White House. The U.S. Department of Energy also said it was ready to release oil from its strategic petroleum reserve if necessary. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also said his department would work with the International Energy Agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialized nations, if global action is needed.  Saudi Arabia, leading a Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis, has blamed regional rival Shi’ite Iran for previous attacks, which Tehran denies. Riyadh accuses Iran of arming the Houthis, a charge denied by the group and Tehran. Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said an investigation had been launched into who planned and executed the strikes. He said the Western-backed alliance would counter threats to global energy security and economic stability. Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said there were no casualties from the attacks.  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said Aramco would have more information within 48 hours, and it will draw down oil in storage to compensate for the loss. Aramco is in the process of planning what is expected to be the world’s largest initial public offering. “Abqaiq is perhaps the most critical facility in the world for oil supply,” said Jason Bordoff, who runs the Center On Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and served on the U.S. National Security Council during Barack Obama’s presidency. “The risk of tit-for-tat regional escalation that pushes oil prices even higher has just gone up significantly.”  Abqaiq is 60 km (37 miles) southwest of Aramco’s Dhahran headquarters. The oil processing plant handles crude from the world’s largest conventional oilfield, the supergiant Ghawar, and for export to terminals Ras Tanura - the world’s biggest offshore oil loading facility - and Juaymah. It also pumps westwards across the kingdom to Red Sea export terminals. Two of the sources said Ghawar was flaring gas after the strikes disrupted gas processing facilities. Khurais, 190 km (118 miles) further southwest, contains the country’s second largest oilfield.  “These attacks against critical infrastructure endanger civilians, are unacceptable, and sooner or later will result in innocent lives being lost,” the embassy quoted Ambassador John Abizaid as saying in a Twitter post. Andrew Murrison, a British foreign affairs minister, called on the Houthis to stop threatening civilian areas and Saudi commercial infrastructure. It was the latest in a series of Houthi missile and drone strikes on Saudi cities that had largely been intercepted, but have recently hit targets, including Shaybah oilfield last month and oil pumping stations in May. Both those attacks caused fires but did not disrupt production. “This is a relatively new situation for the Saudis. For the longest time they have never had any real fears that their oil facilities would be struck from the air,” Kamran Bokhari, founding director of the Washington-based Center for Global Policy, told Reuters. Aramco’s CEO said in a statement that the situation had been brought under control. A Reuters witness said the fire in Abqaiq appeared to have been extinguished by early evening.  Regional tensions have escalated after Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran. The violence is complicating U.N.-led peace efforts to end the Yemen war which has killed tens of thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine. The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The coalition intervened in Yemen after the internationally recognized government was ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis, who say they are fighting a corrupt system. The coalition launched air strikes on Yemen’s northern Saada province, a Houthi stronghold, on Saturday, a Reuters witness said. Houthi-run al Masirah TV said a military camp was struck. The Houthis’ military spokesman, without providing evidence, said drones hit refineries at both Saudi sites, which are more than 1,000 km (621 miles) from the Yemeni capital Sanaa, and pledged a widening of assaults against Saudi Arabia.

""People in the government are making weird statements. These statements will not lead to betterment of economy. But they'll definitely affect the government's image,"" he added.",The Financial Express,"Former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Saturday questioned Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s claim that rise of Ola and Uber affected the automobile sector, asking why the sales of trucks should also decline. Those in power were making “weird” statements, the former finance minister said, talking to reporters here. “People in the government are making weird statements. These statements will not lead to betterment of economy. But they will definitely affect the government’s image,” he said. On Sitharaman’s statement about decline in the automobile sector, where she spoke about people using app-based cab services instead of buying car as one of the causes, Sinha asked, “If companies like Ola and Uber caused a drop in passenger vehicle sales, then why there is a slowdown in sales of two-wheelers and trucks?” “Bihar’s finance minister (Sushil Modi) said there is recession due to Sawan-Bhado (the rainy season).A Union minister (Piyush Goyal) is talking about Einstein’s law of gravity,” the former BJP leader said. Sinha also raised a question about Sitharaman’s announcement to organize a mega-shopping festival in India on the lines of Dubai Shopping Festival to boost exports. “The economies of UAE (United Arab Emirates) and India are different. India’s economy will progress only when farmers in areas like Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh progress,” he said. “We should have grown at a rate of at least eight percent.But in the first quarter of the financial year, the GDP growth has come down to five percent,” he said. The missing three percent growth meant loss of Rs 6 lakh crore in just one quarter, he claimed. Asked about the government’s plan to merge certain public sector banks, he said, “I am not opposed to merger. But it will not reduce their non performing assets automatically.” The process may in fact harm the banks as their officials will get tied up in completing merger formalities instead of focusing on actual banking, Sinha said.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

1468,"US lawmakers seek email records from Apple, FB, Amazon, Google","A US House of Representatives panel has sought internal emails, financial statements and other records from the CEOs of Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google in an antitrust probe. It asked the firms to share internal executive communications spanning a decade, related to their acquisitions and prior antitrust probes. The panel aims to see whether the four engaged in anti-competitive practices.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel on Friday demanded internal emails, detailed financial information and other company records from top executives of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, and Alphabet Inc’s Google, widening the antitrust probe of Big Tech. The letters seek by Oct. 14 internal emails over the last decade from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, among others, about acquisitions. Apple shares fell about 1.8% after the market opened. While Apple had been mentioned as a potential target, the House letter offered the first concrete evidence of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation. Apple has faced criticism that its App Store’s policies and algorithms support its own products and stifle third-party applications. On Monday, the Texas attorney general led a group of 50 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories in a probe of whether Google abuses its market power in advertising.  “There is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications,” said House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, who signed the letters along with Ranking Republican Representative Doug Collins and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee and ranking Republican Jim Sensenbrenner. “This information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,” Collins said in a statement. The lawmakers seek emails from senior executives on topics including acquisitions like Amazon’s purchase of AbeBooks, PillPack, Eero, Ring, Zappos and Whole Foods; and Google’s acquisition of AdMob, YouTube, Android and DoubleClick. They also seek information on various policies including Google’s decision to automatically sign into Chrome any user to logs into any Google service. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google referred to a blog post this week that said its services “create choice for consumers.”  The committee requested information from the companies’ executives on market share, competitors, their largest customers for specific products and documents from other investigations.   It asked Apple for information on App Store concerns such as the decision to remove some parental control apps and its policy regarding whether iPhone users can set non-Apple apps as defaults.   The committee seeks communications on Facebook’s purchase of Instagram, WhatsApp and Onavo and its decisions to integrate Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and to cut off apps from its social graph. The U.S. Justice Department said in July it is investigating “whether and how” large tech companies in “search, social media, and some retail services online” are engaging in anticompetitive behavior. Google said it received a formal request for documents from the Justice Department in late August.

1469,US sanctions North Korean hackers for global cyberattacks,"The US has imposed sanctions on three North Korean hacking groups it blames for the ""WannaCry"" ransomware attacks among other cyberattacks to fund the country's missile program. Naming them Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel, it said they were controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau which is already under US sanctions. The sanctions will freeze US-related assets of the groups.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Friday announced sanctions on three North Korean hacking groups it said were involved in the “WannaCry” ransomware attacks and hacking of international banks and customer accounts. It named the groups as Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel and said they were controlled by the RGB, North Korea’s primary intelligence bureau, which is already subject to U.S. and United Nations sanctions. The action blocks any U.S.-related assets of the groups and prohibits dealings with them. The Treasury statement said any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitated significant transactions or services for them could also be subject to sanctions. “Treasury is taking action against North Korean hacking groups that have been perpetrating cyber attacks to support illicit weapon and missile programs,” said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.  “We will continue to enforce existing U.S. and U.N. sanctions against North Korea and work with the international community to improve cybersecurity of financial networks.” The United States has been attempting to restart talks with North Korea, aimed at pressing the country to give up its nuclear weapons. The talks have been stalled over North Korean demands for concessions, including sanctions relief. Earlier this month, North Korea denied U.N. allegations it had obtained $2 billion through cyberattacks on banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, and accused the United States of spreading rumors.  The Treasury statement said Lazarus Group was involved in the WannaCry ransomware attack that the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom publicly attributed to North Korea in December 2017. It said WannaCry affected at least 150 countries and shut down about 300,000 computers, including many in Britain’s National Health Service (NHS). The NHS attack led to the cancellation of more than 19,000 appointments and ultimately cost the service over $112 million, the biggest known ransomware attack in history.  The Treasury said Lazarus Group was also directly responsible for 2014 cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures Entertainment. The statement cited industry and press reporting as saying that by 2018, Bluenoroff had attempted to steal over $1.1 billion from financial institutions and successfully carried out operations against banks in Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Chile, and Vietnam.  It said Bluenoroff worked with the Lazarus Group to steal approximately $80 million from the Central Bank of Bangladesh’s New York Federal Reserve account. Andariel, meanwhile, was observed by cyber security firms attempting to steal bank card information by hacking into ATMs to withdraw cash or steal customer information to later sell on the black market, the statement said.  Andariel was also responsible for developing and creating unique malware to hack into online poker and gambling sites and, according to industry and press reporting, targeted the South Korea government military in an effort to gather intelligence, it said.

He also hit out at the ruling Congress in the state, alleging it has betrayed the farmers and the youths, and law and order situation has deteriorated under the Ashok Gehlot government. “The BJP will play a sharp, strong and effective role as opposition — both inside and outside of the house.

A large number of party workers and leaders congratulated him and garlanded him in the headquarters for his elevation.BJP national vice president and former chief minister Vasundhara Raje congratulated him over phone.

Because RSS is such a big force, ‘Bhagwa’ (saffron) is respected all over.” Poonia was currently a Rajasthan BJP spokesperson and was also looking after the party’s membership drive in the state. “The mandate in Lok Sabha elections has made it clear that people are with the BJP. But we will make the party stronger at booth level,” the MLA from Jaipur’s Amber constituency said. The post of Rajasthan BJP president was lying vacant since the demise of Madan Lal Saini in June. Poonia’s appointment comes just before local body elections in the state.He said his elevation was dedicated to all the party workers. “I come from a small village and have worked for 40 years in villages, among farmers, tribal youths and will continue doing so. The title has changed but the working style will remain the same. The party workers are feeling happy because they feel that one of their own has been made the state president,” he said. “Local body elections and bypolls on two assembly seats are coming and we will work to make the party stronger at the ground level for our victory,” he said. Poonia, who belongs to Rajgarh town of Churu district, has been with the RSS since his childhood.He began his student politics in 1982 and conducted a programme — ‘Dr Hedgewar olympics’ — to mark the birth centenary year of RSS founder KB Hedgewar in the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, in 1988. This was the first direct programme of the RSS in the university. Poonia served as RSS’ state general secretary for four terms between 2004-14.

The National Music Publishers' Association said Peloton streamed over 2,000 unlicensed songs in its workout videos. Discovering the misuse of even more songs, they requested the addition of 1,324 songs to their lawsuit.",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Music publishers have asked a federal judge to let them double their lawsuit against Peloton Interactive Inc to $300 million, saying the maker of stationary bicycles has streamed more than 2,000 workout videos used without permission. The National Music Publishers’ Association, a trade group, said on Friday that since suing Peloton in March for copyright infringement, publishers have found a trove of additional songs that the New York-based company knowingly and recklessly offered to customers without first getting required licenses. These allegedly included songs from Adele, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, John Legend, Maroon 5, Meek Mill and Taylor Swift, as well as classics such as The Beatles’ “I Saw Her Standing There,” Ray Charles’ “Georgia On My Mind” and The Who’s “I Can See For Miles.” Publishers want to add 1,324 songs to their lawsuit, the trade group said. “Peloton fully understood what the copyright law required, having entered licenses with certain other copyright holders, while trampling the rights of plaintiffs by using their musical works for free and without permission,” the publishers said in a proposed amended complaint filed late on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan must grant approval before publishers can pursue their expanded case. The proposed complaint was filed two days after Peloton said it planned to raise up to $1.33 billion in an initial public offering, by offering 46 million shares priced between $26 and $29 each. Peloton said its platform could have been developed only through “close collaboration” with major labels and music publishers, among others. “We will continue to defend ourselves against claims made in this matter and look forward to pursuing our counterclaims,” the company said in an emailed statement. In a Friday court filing, Peloton’s lawyers asked Cote to schedule a conference to address the publishers’ and NMPA’s alleged failure to turn over documents relevant to its case, saying the parties had reached an “impasse.” Founded in 2012, Peloton sells stationary bicycles starting at $2,245, in packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home. Unlimited access costs $39 a month. The case is Downtown Music Publishing LLC et al v Peloton Interactive Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-02426.

1480,Why wasn't Bairstow penalised for fooling Smith with fake fielding?,"England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow faked collecting the ball which forced Steve Smith to dive in the 30th over of Australia's first innings in fifth Ashes Test. The umpires didn't penalise Bairstow under fake fielding rules as his action was considered to be done ""out of jest"" than out of ""an attempt to cause confusion and prevent a run being scored"".",CricTracker,"The fifth and final Ashes Test is currently in progress at The Oval. Australia have already retained the urn by winning the Manchester Test but are lagging behind in the ongoing encounter. They were bowled out for just 225 runs in response to England’s 294. During the second day’s play though a unique incident hogged the limelight.It happened during the course of play when Steve Smith set off to take a run from the non-striker’s end. And while he was reaching the crease easily, Jonny Bairstow, England wicket-keeper, acted as if the ball had come into his gloves thereby concerning the batsman of getting run-out. Bairstow just imitated as if he was disturbing the bails with the ball in his hands when the throw had come at the bowler’s end.AdvertisementSteve Smith, at the same time, dived in a bid to save himself from getting out only to be fooled by Bairstow. While nothing much was said by the players or the Australian team about the incident, Bairstow had clearly violated the fake fielding rule which was introduced by the ICC recently.According to the existing rule, if a player violates the ‘fake fielding’, the umpires are entitled to award five runs to the opposition team. But the on-field officials, Kumar Dharmasena and Marais Erasmus, didn’t feel the need to do so which has left many perplexed. If the player deliberately fakes the fielding, then only the umpires can impose the penalty runs.Marnus Labuschagne was the first to violate this rule during Australia domestic One-Day tournament when the umpires had penalised his team. Also, Kumar Sangakkara had once bluffed Ahmed Shehzad during an ODI between Sri Lanka and New Zealand.After the latter incident, Fraser Stewart, MCC’s Laws of Cricket manager, explained the rule stating that it is up to the umpires to decide if the fielder had faked the fielding ‘deliberately’. “The Sangakkara example is less clear-cut. Technically, he is deliberately attempting to deceive the batsman, but I’m not sure what advantage he is gaining – not that the gaining of advantage needs to be proved.“It seems to be done more out of jest than out of an attempt to cause confusion and prevent a run being scored. Under the letter of the Law, one could not argue with the penalty being imposed. Equally, however, an umpire might choose to handle it by having a quiet word and informing him of the new law. As with any law like this, it is always going to be for the umpires to decide what is “deliberate” and what is “deception”,” he had told while speaking to ESPNCricinfo.Now if the above explanation is compared with Jonny Bairstow’s incident, the wicketkeeper didn’t gain any advantage as he tried to deceive Steve Smith. Here, it all comes down to the umpires and their judgement. They also have to consider the fact that Smith had to dive to save his wicket due to Bairstow’s actions. While doing so, he could’ve injured himself as well.",https://www.crictracker.com/ashes-2019-why-umpires-did-not-penalise-england-for-jonny-bairstows-fake-fielding/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Authorities said that there was no evidence that any medical procedures were conducted at the doctor's property in Illinois. Klopfer's medical licence was indefinitely suspended in 2016 for violating various state laws.",Daily Mail,"The remains of more than 2,000 fetuses have been found at the home of an abortion doctor who died just 10 days ago. The 2,246 fetal remains were discovered in the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer in Will County, Illinois.Klopfer died on September 3 and it was while family members were going through his home that they found the medically preserved fetuses. An attorney for the family was said to have contacted the coroner's office on Thursday about the discovery. It was estimated that he had performed tens of thousands of abortion procedures in multiple Indiana counties for decades, making him 'likely' to be the state's 'most prolific abortion doctor in history,' according to the South Bend Tribune. The 2,246 fetal remains were discovered in the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer in Will County, IllinoisThere is currently no evidence to suggest abortions were carried out at the property, authorities said. The doctor had performed abortions at Women's Pavilion in South Bend, Indiana, until his license was suspended in 2016 for failure to exercise reasonable patient care and violating multiple notice and documentation requirements, according to the South Bend Tribune. The suspension came after a 2014 Indiana Department of Health review which resulted in Klopfer's clinic being cited for 27 deficiencies, ABC 57 reported. When the clinic failed to submit a plan of correction for those problems, the state agency filed a complaint and hearing request to revoke the clinic's abortion license. Another review was conducted in June 2015, during which it was found that the clinic wasn't adhering to the state law that patients needed to give their voluntary and informed consent 18 hours prior to an abortion being performed. Klopfer was allegedly giving out the abortion medication during the initial consultation, instead. Klopfer performed abortions at the Women's Pavilion (pictured) in South Bend, IndianaKlopfer had his medical license suspended in 2016 for failure to exercise reasonable patient care and violating multiple notice and documentation requirementsFollowing his 2016 hearing, Klopfer, who was 71 at the time, was given a minimum six-month suspension following 12 hours of testimony and thousands of exhibits.   The testimony reportedly indicated that Klopfer had been using the same sort of abortion and sedation procedures that he had used since the 1970s and 1980s. Klopfer said at the time that he had never had a patient die or go into cardiac arrest in the 43 years that he had been performing abortions. Despite it not being part of the complaints that were brought against him, Klopfer also spoke about performing an abortion on a 10-year-old girl at an Illinois hospital after she had been raped by her uncle. Instead of notifying police about the child abuse, however, he allowed her to return home with her parents, who knew about the rape and had refused to prosecute the uncle. Klopfer was found to have not given pain medications to all women who he performed abortions on, only women under the age of 16 and women who could afford to pay extra for it. And, when women were sedated, there wasn't anyone on his staff that was qualified to monitor the women, in addition to not following best practices for the administration of drugs and emergency procedures. Klopfer (in green shirt) was accused of failing to report abortions performed on two 13-year-old girls in the time mandated by the state in 2014, but those charges were dismissedKlopfer (in 1994) was said to be Indiana's 'most prolific abortion doctor' and was thought to have performed tens of thousands of abortions since he began doing them in 1973He was said to have had very few complications during the procedures, though.  The doctor was found guilty of five of the nine charges against him during the hearing. Among those charges was not reporting abortions performed on two girls under the age of 14 within the state's required three-day timeline. Klopfer had previously come under legal scrutiny in March 2014, after a local right to life organization reported to authorities that he had failed to report abortions on girls under the age of 14 in a timely manner. Instead of three days, it took Klopfer three to four months to file the paperwork, ABC57 reported.   Klopfer said at the time: 'Let me put it this way, if there's any question, it's a question about paperwork, it's not a question about any medical malpractice or anything like that.'In addition to having his license suspended, Klopfer was find $3,000. The board said he could petition to have his license reinstated after six months, but that he would need to submit to a long list of evaluations, as well as obtaining continuing medical education credits and child abuse training. At the time of the hearing, Klopfer was not practicing medicine and had closed his three abortion clinics in Fort Wayne, Gary and South Bend, Illinois, by November 2015. Still, he had indicated that he wanted to reopen clinics when he could.It's unclear if Klopfer had his license reinstated, however.   Klopfer first began performing abortions in 1973 following the legalization of abortion by Roe v. Wade, the Journal Gazette reported. The coroner's office has since taken possession of the fetuses found on Klopfer's property and Illinois' Will County Sheriff, coroner and state's attorney are conducting an ongoing investigation into the remains, according to the News-Herald. Klopfer's family is said to be cooperating with authorities.  ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7462939/Remains-2-000-fetuses-home-former-abortion-doctor.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

You could close this shut without worrying quite so much about wear and tear.Notably, the patent comes from Microsoft's technology licensing team. That suggests this isn't necessarily reserved for a specific device, or even Microsoft devices in general. Instead, Microsoft might license the technology to other hardware makers as foldable screens become more practical.You're unlikely see a foldable Surface tablet at Microsoft's October 2nd event, if you see one at all.

The video giant will no longer count ad views toward rankings on the YouTube Music Charts, instead relying solely on ""organic"" views like direct links, embeds, searches and the Trending section.  This won't affect the achievements for previous videos, but any artist or label hoping to set a 24-hour record will have to do it by attracting viewers, not by spending a mountain of money on ads.As Rolling Stone observed, the outgoing system effectively let companies pay to climb the charts.  YouTube's TrueView ads let marketers play shortened versions of videos that would count as views if you either watched for long enough or interacted with them.  This let artists and labels game the system by purchasing enough ads to help a song rise to the top.  Indian rapper Badshah managed to outperform K-pop megastars BTS through ads, Bloomberg added, while Blackpink, Taylor Swift and others also benefited from the approach.The move won't necessarily lead to fewer music video ads.  The promos still translate to greater exposure.  However, it could force the industry to stagger those ads and think about longer-term success instead of bombarding users for a short period to artificially inflate views and claim a temporary victory.  YouTube didn't have much choice as it is. As long as ads counted toward views, the credibility of its charts was tarnished.

Malik also claimed that he has managed to change the image of the gubernatorial post, which in public’s view does nothing for the public and just rests during the tenure.Speaking at an event in Kathua, Malik said, “In the eyes of the country, Governor is a person who plays golf and does nothing for public, he/she just rests during their governorship. But the amount of work that we’ve done in last one year, I don’t think even an elected government does that much work.”Jammu and Kashmir has been under an unprecedented lockdown since August 5 when the Centre scrapped Article 370 and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories.

1499,Autonomous vehicle startup Voyage raises $31 million,"Silicon Valley's autonomous vehicle startup Voyage has raised $31 million in a Series B round led by investment management firm Franklin Templeton. Jaguar Land Rover's InMotion Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures and Khosla Ventures also took part in the round. Co-founded in 2017 by Oliver Cameron and MacCallister Higgins, the startup operates self-driving cab services in retirement communities.",TechCrunch,"Voyage,  the autonomous vehicle startup that spun out of Udacity, announced Thursday it has raised $31 million in a round led by Franklin Templeton.Khosla Ventures,  Jaguar Land Rover’s InMotion Ventures and Chevron Technology Ventures  also participated in the round. The company, which operates a ride-hailing service in retirement communities using self-driving cars supported by human safety drivers, has raised a total of $52 million since launching in 2017. The new funding includes a $3 million convertible note.Voyage CEO Oliver Cameron  has big plans for the fresh injection of capital, including hiring and expanding its fleet of self-driving Chrysler  Pacifica minivans, which always have a human safety driver behind the wheel.Ultimately, the expanded G2 fleet and staff are just the means toward Cameron’s grander mission to turn Voyage into a truly driverless and profitable ride-hailing company.“It’s not just about solving self-driving technology,” Cameron told TechCrunch in a recent interview, explaining that a cost-effective vehicle designed to be driverless is the essential piece required to make this a profitable business.The company is in the midst of a hiring campaign that Cameron hopes will take its 55-person staff to more than 150 over the next year. Voyage has had some success attracting high-profile people to fill executive-level positions, including CTO Drew Gray, who previously worked at Uber ATG, Otto, Cruise and Tesla, as well as former NIO and Tesla  employee Davide Bacchet as director of autonomy.Funds will also be used to increase its fleet of second-generation self-driving cars (called G2) that are currently being used in a 4,000-resident retirement community in San Jose, Calif., as well as The Villages, a 40-square-mile, 125,000-resident retirement city in Florida. Voyage’s G2 fleet has 12 vehicles. Cameron didn’t provide details on how many vehicles it will add to its G2 fleet, only describing it as a “nice jump that will allow us to serve consumers.”Voyage used the G2 vehicles to create a template of sorts for its eventual driverless vehicle. This driverless product — a term Cameron has used in a previous post on Medium — will initially be limited to 25 miles per hour, which is the driving speed within the two retirement communities in which Voyage currently tests and operates. The vehicle might operate at a low speed, but they are capable of handling complex traffic interactions, he wrote.“It won’t be the most cost-effective vehicle ever made because the industry still is in its infancy, but it will be a huge, huge, huge improvement over our G2 vehicle in terms of being be able to scale out a commercial service and make money on each ride,” Cameron said. Voyage initially used modified Ford Fusion vehicles to test its autonomous vehicle technology, then introduced in July 2018 Chrysler Pacifica minivans, its second generation of autonomous vehicles. But the end goal has always been a driverless product.TechCrunch previously reported that the company has partnered with an automaker to provide this next-generation vehicle that has been designed specifically for autonomous driving. Cameron wouldn’t name the automaker. The vehicle will be electric and it won’t be a retrofit like the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid vehicles Voyage currently uses or its first-generation vehicle, a Ford Fusion.Most importantly, and a detail Cameron did share with TechCrunch, is that the vehicle it uses for its driverless service will have redundancies and safety-critical applications built into it.Voyage also has deals in place with Enterprise Fleet Management and Intact insurance company to help it scale.“You can imagine leasing is much more optimal than purchasing and owning vehicles on your balance sheet,” Cameron said. “We have those deals in place that will allow us to not only get the vehicle costs down, but other aspects of the vehicle into the right place as well.”",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/voyage-raises-31-million-to-bring-driverless-taxis-to-communities/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The Jharkhand-born won’t be playing the T20I series versus South Africa as well.In the meantime, a couple of days ago, rumours did the rounds that Dhoni would be holding a press conference where he would put forth his decision of bidding adieu to cricket. The fact that Virat Kohli, the Indian skipper, posted a picture along with Dhoni, made people speculate even more. Kohli wrote, “A game I can never forget. Special night. This man, made me run like in a fitness test.”AdvertisementLater, it was learned that the news of Dhoni announcing his retirement was baseless. Even Sakshi Dhoni, MSD’s wife, put up a post on his Instagram story, clearing the air. Kohli is definitely not a happy man as his post for Dhoni was being perceived in a wrong way. He said that he put up the post only to reminisce the experience, he had with the enigmatic cricketer.“All that I did was put up a pic on Instagram. I never got to talk about that innings so I reminisced about it & people took it the wrong way. There was no message in that picture as people suggested,” Virat was quoted as saying in a press conference.There haven’t been any concrete developments on Dhoni’s future in international cricket. After the World Cup, it was communicated that Dhoni won’t be the national team’s number one keeper. Rather, he would be a part of the transition process with Rishabh Pant being groomed. The plans are also being made, bearing in mind the 2020 edition of the T20 World Cup in Australia.Most of the pundits have had their say on when the 38-year-old Dhoni should call it quits.

And, one of my activities is reading about politics.”READ: England’s Monty Panesar to play in the Ranji Trophy for Puducherry?Describing India as the superpower of cricket, Panesar said that it is the Indian fans that make championships successful by their numbers and enthusiasm.“India is now a thriving nation and soon India will take over the world,” said the bowler, who triggered ‘Monty Mania’ with his very first wicket for the England team being that of Sachin Tendulkar in 2012.He fondly refers to the Indian batting legend as “Sachin Paaji”.“Sachin Tendulkar should always be at the top. He was a role model not just for India but also for British Indians. He is the greatest sportsman ever and will always be the god of cricket,” he said.In his book, Panesar speaks about the racism faced by his parents’ generation, about growing up as a happy, cricket-obsessed child in England and his thoughts about the infamous Lord Norman Tebbit cricket test, which questioned the loyalties of Britain’s immigrant population.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/monty-panesar-eyes-career-in-politics-wants-to-be-mayor-of-london-891139?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1508,Using drones to study Amazon rainforest's health: Harvard team,"Harvard University researchers are using specifically-engineered drones to monitor the effects of climate change on the Amazon rainforest's health. Researchers aim to monitor unique chemical signatures emitted by plants species, which change if they are under stress, in varied ecosystems. They began work in 2017 with Amazonas State University and the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation.",Engadget,"Researchers from Harvard University are using drones to better understand the Amazon rainforest. With drone-based sensors, the researchers hope to determine the unique ""fingerprint"" of different rainforest ecosystems. That could help them monitor the health of the forest and understand how it's responding to climate change, deforestation and fire.Every plant emits a different volatile organic compound (VOC) signature, or fingerprint, which can change based on factors like drought or flood. By monitoring these signals, scientists can study how forest ecosystems adapt to stressors. Despite that valuable info, the Amazon's VOCs were previously monitored by just a handful of towers built in one type of ecosystem. The data was limited and biased, and biosphere emissions models assumed nearby ecosystems had the same VOC emissions.Since 2017, researchers from Harvard, Amazonas State University (UEA) and the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation (FAPEAM) have been working on a drone-based system to map the VOCs emitted in different ecosystems in central Amazonia.Their research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, proves that different ecosystems have different VOC signatures. Next, the team plans to sample more ecosystems in water-logged valleys along rivers. They'll use a boat as a launching platform, and hope to test a three-drone fleet.""This research highlights how little we understood forest heterogeneity,"" said Harvard professor Scot Martin. ""But drone-assisted technologies can help us understand and quantify VOC emissions in different, nearby ecosystems in order to better represent them in climate and air quality model simulations.""Advancements in drone technology could make research like this more common. Already, Boeing is working on a solar-powered drone that will gather climate data and atmospheric research, and of course, we've seen drones put to use surveying farms and crops.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/13/harvard-university-drones-research-amazon-rainforest/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1514,Afghan Taliban sends team to Russia after US talks collapse,The Taliban has sent a delegation to Russia to discuss prospects for a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan following collapse of talks with the US this month. Taliban said US President Donald Trump's decision to call off the peace process came at a time when both sides had resolved all outstanding issues and were about to sign an agreement.,Reuters,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban have sent a delegation to Russia to discuss prospects for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan following the collapse of talks with the United States this month, officials from the insurgent group said. The move, days after U.S. President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting with Taliban leaders at his Camp David retreat, came as the movement looks to bolster regional support, with visits also planned for China, Iran and Central Asian states. “The purpose of these visits is to inform leaders of these countries about the peace talks and President Trump’s decision to call off the peace process at a time when both sides had resolved all outstanding issues and were about to sign a peace agreement,” said a senior Taliban leader in Qatar. Russia, which has hosted meetings between the Taliban and Afghan political and civil society representatives, said this week it hoped that the process could be put back on track and urged both sides to resume talks. “We are convinced that the complete end to foreign military presence is an inalienable condition of durable peace in Afghanistan,” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday. However, it is unclear whether the talks can be resumed. The Taliban leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the purpose of the visits was not to try to revive negotiations with the United States but to assess regional support for forcing it to leave Afghanistan. U.S. and Taliban officials held months of talks in the Qatari capital of Doha and agreed a draft accord that would have seen some 5,000 U.S. troops withdrawn from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the Taliban. However, the deal, intended as a preliminary step to a wider peace agreement, faced heavy criticism from the Afghan government, which was shut out of the talks. Many former senior U.S. officials who had worked in the region also warned a hasty withdrawal risked destabilizing the country and even plunging it back into a new round of civil war. The draft accord did not include a ceasefire agreement and with violence continuing, Trump announced the cancellation of the Camp David meeting via Twitter after a suicide bomb attack in Kabul killed at least 12 people including a U.S. soldier. He subsequently described the talks as dead and said U.S. forces would step up operations against the Taliban, who control more territory than at any time since they were ousted from power by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001.

The 16-year-old was greeted by hundreds of mostly young people carrying signs reading 'People or Profit?' and 'Warming!', and chanting 'This is a crisis, act like it!'. Notably, US President Donald Trump is among the few global leaders who have openly questioned the science of climate change.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who shot to global fame for inspiring worldwide student strikes to promote action against climate change, took her mission to U.S. President Donald Trump’s doorstep on Friday with a protest outside the White House. Thunberg, wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt with her hair loosely pulled back in a ponytail, was greeted with a hero’s welcome by hundreds of mostly young people carrying signs reading “People or Profit?” and “Warming!”, and chanting “This is a crisis, act like it!” and “Business as usual is not enough.”  “This is very overwhelming,” she said softly into a megaphone after a march in front of the White House in which she walked amidst the other activists instead of in front - sometimes hard to hear over the cheers.  “See you next week,” she said toward the end of the event, referring to a planned Sept. 20 global “Climate Strike” in which youth and adults are encouraged to walk out of school or work to urge more action on climate change. The demonstration marked the first high-profile event of Thunberg’s six-day visit to Washington, intended to pressure the Trump administration and Congress ahead of a United Nations climate summit, where world leaders will be asked to ramp up their carbon emissions cutting to fend off global warming. Trump is among a small minority of global leaders who has openly questioned the science of climate change. He has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement – a global pact to stem the rise in global temperatures - and has a policy of maximizing American production of fossil fuels.  Thunberg has said she does not believe she can convince Trump or other climate change doubters that global warming is real, but hopes they will take briefings from “actual scientists and experts in this area.” here The 16-year-old activist gained attention last year, when she started skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Sweden’s parliament. After arriving in the United States in August by sailboat to reduce her carbon footprint, she is bound for New York later this month, where she will take part in the U.N. climate summit. While in Washington, Thunberg will address Congress on climate change and later join Democratic lawmakers and plaintiffs in the Juliana v the United States case - in which a group of young people sued the government for failing to address climate change – at the Supreme Court. Thunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize earlier this year after the number of students taking part in her strikes - dubbed “Fridays for Future” - broke 2 million across 135 countries. She was named one of the world’s most influential people by Time magazine in May.  Jennifer Morash, a doctoral candidate in plant science, brought her daughter Adeline, 9, to the rally to see Thunberg after getting permission from her school in Maryland.  “I just want to make sure we all have a happy future and for people to take climate change seriously,” Adeline said.

1520,"Top trader body seeks ban on Amazon, Flipkart's festive season sales","The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has asked the government to ban upcoming festive sales on Amazon and Flipkart, saying their deep discounts violate FDI rules. It also demanded a ""blanket ban"" on such sales and asked the government to probe the potential violation of FDI norms. Both Amazon and Flipkart said sellers decide the pricing for their products.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - A leading Indian trader body asked the government on Friday to ban upcoming festive sales on Amazon’s local unit and its rival Flipkart, saying their deep discounts violate the country’s foreign investment rules for online retail. The two e-commerce firms typically hold annual festive season sales ahead of key Hindu festivals Dussehra and Diwali, which are due this year in October, when Indians make big ticket purchases such as cars and gold jewelry. Walmart-owned Flipkart’s six-day sale begins Sept. 29, while Amazon is yet to announce dates. Both e-retailers promise big discounts on everything from fashion to smartphones to home appliances and have previously said discounts and deals are offered by sellers on their platforms. “By offering deep discounts ranging from 10% to 80% on their e-commerce portals, these companies are clearly influencing the prices and create an uneven level playing field which is in direct contravention of the policy,” the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said in a letter to the federal trade minister. CAIT, which represents 500,000 merchants and traders in India, also demanded a “blanket ban” on such sales and asked the government to probe the potential violation of FDI norms. Its demand is unlikely to see government action before this year’s sales kick off but it could help frame government policy on deep discounts. India does not allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in inventory-driven models of e-commerce, used by Walmart and Amazon in the United States, where goods and services are owned by an e-commerce firm that sells directly to retail customers. It modified e-commerce rules late last year to protect the country’s vast unorganized retail sector that does not have the clout to purchase at scale and offer big discounts. Those rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to reconfigure ownership structures and re-jig some key vendor relationships and agreements. Asked for comment, Flipkart said more than 100,000 sellers on its platform awaited its ‘Big Billion Days’ sale event. “We empower our sellers with business insights that allow them to decide the best value for their own products, so they can deliver benefits and savings to consumers and scale their businesses at the same time,” said Rajneesh Kumar, chief corporate affairs officer at Flipkart Group. Amazon said more than 500,000 sellers - a bulk of which are small businesses, women entrepreneurs, startups, weavers and artisans - use the festive sale to reach customers. “Sellers decide the pricing for their products on our marketplace,” a spokeswoman for Amazon said. “They offer their choice of selection to their customers across the country at prices that they deem fit.” Amazon last month said at an open panel discussion, organized by India’s competition watchdog, that it abides by all Indian rules and does not influence pricing of products on its website.

Unity in diversity is the foundation of this country. The BJP government is trying to destroy this,” he added.Stalin alleged that Shah’s statement about making Hindi a unifying language was an attempt to make citizens of the non-Hindi speaking state as second class citizens.“If the language spoken by majority should be declared as national language, then crow should be the national bird... DMK is ready to save the plurality and integrity of this country. We warn that this is India and not Hindiya,” he further said.Earlier today, Shah, on the occasion of Hindi Diwas, said that Hindi is the language which can unify the country while asserting that India is a country of different languages and each language hold its own importance.""India is a country of different languages and every language has its own importance but it is very important to have a language of the whole country which should become the identity of India in the world. Today, if one language can do the work of tying the country to the door of unity, then it is the most spoken Hindi language,"" Shah said in a series of tweets in Hindi.
Asserting that languages of several countries in this world have become extinct, Shah said that the country that loses its language can't preserve its culture and loses its existence too.“Diversity of languages and dialects is the strength of our nation. But there is need for our nation to have one language, so that foreign languages don't find a place. This is why our freedom fighters envisioned Hindi as 'Raj bhasha',” he added.Besides, Stalin, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi also criticised Shah for his comment and said that India is much bigger than Hindi, Hindu and Hindutva.“Could you try appreciating the diversity & beauty of the many mother tongues that dot this land? Article 29 gives every Indian the right to a distinct language, script & culture,” Owaisi tweeted.Hindi diwas is celebrated every year on September 14 to mark the adoption of Hindi as the official language of India by India's Constituent Assembly.  ",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/is-it-india-or-hindia-asks-dmk-president-mk-stalin-over-amit-shahs-push-for-hindi-language/488633?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The 32-year-old is regaining his fitness after a hip resurfacing procedure in January, and late last month recorded the first two victories of his singles comeback at the Rafa Nadal Open Challenger tournament in Mallorca before making a third-round exit. Briton Murray, who has dropped to 415 in the world rankings, will next compete in Zhuhai, Beijing and Shanghai in the Asian swing of the ATP tour this year, but the three-times major winner thinks that it will be 2020 before he is “maybe” able to face the challenge of playing Federer or Nadal. “For years... I competed against them, although I haven’t won every time. I’ve lost more than I’ve won but I always went out onto court feeling I could win,” Murray told Sky Sports. “I don’t know if I’d enjoy going out on court against them knowing I’m going to lose or feeling like I had no chance. That would probably be psychologically challenging... I need to be patient and not expect too much too soon. “But maybe in four or five months, I can get there. In terms of how I’m hitting the ball in practice... the skill is still there. I physically need to get a little better and hopefully over time I get a little bit faster...

I don’t want to play or be selected just because four years ago I played really well,” Murray, who guided Britain to the title in 2015, added. “I’d like to help and be in the team and play singles, but if I was asked to play doubles I’d probably do that.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-murray/murray-hopes-to-be-fit-enough-by-next-year-to-play-federer-nadal-idUSKCN1VY0N5?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Several people on the two sides suffered injuries in the skirmish, a police officer said.The injured have been admitted to a nearby government hospital for treatment, he said. According to sources, police lobbed tear gas shells and used water cannons to disperse CPI(M) youth and students’ wing activists, who pelted stones at them.Members of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) on Thursday took out a rally from Singur, the venue of the abandoned Tata Nano car plant, demanding jobs for the youth of the state.The rally was scheduled to culminate at the state secretariat on Friday afternoon, but was stopped near Mullick Ghat in Howrah, 5 km away. Sources said the activists, in their attempt to move forward, broke one of the three barricades set up by the police at Mullick Ghat.A scuffle ensued with the police shortly after, with the agitators hurling bricks at the security personnel, who retaliated with tear gas shells and baton charge, they said. “We were told by the police that five of our representatives would be allowed to go to Nabanna to submit a deputation. But as soon as our peaceful rally reached Mullick Ghat, police resorted to unprovoked lathi charge and tear gas shell firing,” DYFI state secretary Sayandeep Mitra said.A number of SFI and DYFI workers fell unconscious during the clash, he said. “We were to submit thousands of applications seeking jobs and answers on various other issues from Banerjee, as part of the TMC government’s “Didi ke Bolo” public outreach initiative,” Mitra told reporters.The Mamata Banerjee government had been sitting on the “debris of an industry” in Singur, he claimed. “She has failed to bring about economic development in West Bengal. Several business summits were organised over the past few years but not investment has been made. Lakhs of youths are unemployed,” the DYFI state secretary added.Rebutting the allegations, West Bengal education minister and senior TMC leader Partha Chatterjee said the Left Front activists were trying to disturb the “peaceful atmosphere” in the state. Singur had become the hotbed of West Bengal politics in 2008, after the Trinamool Congress, led by Mamata Banerjee, fought a pitched battle with the erstwhile Left Front government over land acquisition for Tata’s Nano factory. The TMC agitation eventually led to the exit of the proposed small car factory and catapulted then opposition leader, Banerjee, to power.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

The White House called the criticism ""ridiculous"".",Daily Mail,"A White House spokesperson has fired back at social media users who criticized Melania Trump over a dress she wore in a 9/11 tribute image — because they claimed the stitching on the back of it resembled a plane flying into one of the Twin Towers. Melania, 49, faced backlash on Twitter on Wednesday — the 18th anniversary of the terrorist attacks — when President Trump shared a photo of himself with her at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, with the caption, 'We will never forget 9.11.01.' The image was taken when the couple visited the memorial on September 11, 2018,  and the tribute draws attention to the back of Melania's custom navy blue Herve Pierre coat, which features white stitching that some social media users insist looks like a skyscraper.Tribute: President Donald Trump, 73, took to social media on Wednesday to share a photo of himself and Melania, 49, at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania in honor of 9/11Old photo: The image, which was taken when they visited the memorial last year on September 11, draws attention to the back of Melania's custom navy blue Herve Pierre coatNext to the design is a button flap that is also stitched in white, and some claim it resembles the images of the World Trade Center being struck by aircraft.Although Melania was photographed wearing the custom coat from all angles during last year's visit to the 9/11 memorial in Pennsylvania, the now-controversial custom design seems to have gone relatively unnoticed — until now. Controversy: Twitter users slammed Melania for the white stitching and button flap on her coat, insisting it resembles the images of the World Trade Center being struck by aircraftShortly after the tribute image was shared on social media by the president, dozens of users responded to criticize the sartorial choice, prompting a furious backlash that White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham has since slammed as 'ridiculous'.Former Bachelor contestant Ashley Spivey was among those who drew attention to the ill-advised design on the coat. 'I'm sure I’m not the first one to spot this but who in the world thought it was a good idea for Melania to wear this coat in the 9/11 photo,' she tweeted. 'It legit looks like an object is flying into a tower or the Washington Monument.' 'Is...is that a plane crashing into one of the twin towers in the back of Melania’s coat?!?' Abe Caldwell asked. Someone else commented: 'Melania wears a coat in [their] 911 post that literally looks like a plane flew into a tower. Did they fire all the stylists too or is Melania just the biggest troll ever??' Others were just utterly confused by the design, with one person tweeting: 'This is not a post to tee off on or unnecessarily savage Melania's 9/11 attire. But what the hell is that?'The first lady's fashion choices are often skewered on social media, and former White House aide Omarosa Newman-Manigault claims in her memoir, Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House, that Melania uses her style to 'punish' Trump. Shortly after Trump's 'grab 'em by the p***y' tape leaked, Melania wore a pussy-bow blouse at the second presidential debate in October 2016. She donned a white suit to her husband's State of the Union speech in January 2019, which some believed was a show of solidarity with the women's suffrage movement. And she infamously wore a $39 Zara jacket emblazoned with the words, 'I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?' as she departed to visit children separated from their families at the border in June 2018.Timeline: The now-controversial custom design on Melania's coat seems to have gone relatively unnoticed — until now. Despite the backlash, some people defended the look Some Twitter users insisted Melania's custom Herve Pierre coat with its questionable stitching was yet another example of her using fashion to make a statement. 'Melania never wears something by accident. She is deliberate,' one person tweeted. 'She wore a pussy-bow blouse after Trump's pussy-grab statement. She wore an ""I don't really care"" jacket when she went to see children in cages. On the anniversary of 9/11 she wears this embroidered coat? WTAF?' 'What the heck is on Melania’s skirt? It’s like a huge Washington Monument being quite untoward. Melania knew that weird skirt design would grab all the attention,' someone else tweeted. 'On a 9/11 photo shoot, she made it all about her. Who says she’s not a Trump?'  Despite the backlash, there were those who liked the coat, with one person commenting: 'Melania‘s jacket has the Washington monument stitching with a button flap on lower back. Very cool coat.'Paying tribute: President Donald Trump and and first lady Melania observed a moment of silence at the White House on Wednesday to mark the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacksDifferent outfit: Melania wore a simple black shirt dress cinched with a black alligator-skin beltHard to forget: Melania infamously sparked backlash when she wore a jacket that says, 'I really don't care, do u?' to visit children separated from their families at the border in June 2018Another person noted that the 'plane' they were seeing in the design is actually 'a flap of cloth that allows it to reach across the stitching/hem to the button.'White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, who was previously the first lady's press secretary, brushed off the controversy, telling USA Today: 'It's ridiculous.' Much of the ire was over the fact that Melania wore the coat to pay tribute to 9/11 victims, which she did — a year ago. The first lady may be surprised to be getting flack for the coat when she had on an entirely different outfit to observe 9/11 at the White House and Pentagon on Wednesday. Melania wore a simple black shirt dress cinched with a black alligator-skin belt to lead the White House staff in a moment of silence on the South Lawn to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the attacks before their visit to the Pentagon. ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7457163/Melania-Trump-criticized-9-11-tribute-outfit.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1596,Delhi Police investigates Budweiser owner in tax evasion case,Delhi Police is investigating a case of alleged tax evasion involving Budweiser owner AB InBev after receiving a request from the Delhi government. Local authorities barred AB InBev in July from selling its beer in Delhi for three years over alleged tax evasion. Delhi Police said it would conduct its own probe before registering a formal case.,Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in India’s capital New Delhi are probing a case of alleged tax evasion involving Anheuser-Busch InBev, according to a police officer and a document seen by Reuters, a setback for the brewer already battling a three-year city ban. Local authorities barred AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer, in July from selling its beer in the high profile New Delhi market for evading taxes. The company has denied the allegations and appealed the order. The Delhi ban followed an investigation by city authorities which found that beer maker SABMiller - acquired by AB InBev in 2016 for around $100 billion - used duplicate barcodes on its beer bottles supplied to city retailers that year, allowing it to pay lower taxes. The Delhi government’s ban order had also called for further action against the company and a local bar outlet for alleged violation of criminal law provisions such as conspiracy, cheating and forgery. A senior Delhi police official, Anant Kumar Gunjan, told Reuters that officers have launched an investigation into the case after receiving a request from the city government, a move that could potentially lead to criminal charges.  “We are investigating this, it is under inquiry,” said Gunjan, adding that police would conduct its own probe before registering a formal case. AB InBev told Reuters in a statement on Friday that it was aware of the “potential for an additional authority to take interest in allegations” raised in the Delhi government’s ban order.  “It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time. We are committed to operating with integrity and high ethical standards,” a spokesman said, adding that the allegations dated back to 2016, before its takeover of SABMiller. News of the police investigation will add to the company’s woes in New Delhi, where it is already arguing against the ban order with city authorities and in court. Separately, AB InBev is also battling an Indian antitrust watchdog investigation concerning alleged beer price-fixing by SABMiller and others. “The ban only has a financial impact, the police case could be a much bigger headache for the company and can have wider ramifications,” said Sandeep Chilana, a New Delhi-based lawyer specializing in taxation and liquor laws. The Delhi administration made a written request to police authorities last month to register a case, according to a government document dated Sept. 6, seen by Reuters on Friday.  “Considering the gravity of the offence, it is opined that even a harsher and exemplary punishment (than the ban) ... would have also been justified in this case,” the document said.   AB InBev, which sells popular beer brands such as Budweiser and Hoegaarden, is the second biggest player in India’s $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5% market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.

""I eat a lot...My mum likes to feed me...I haven't had as many roasts at home in last six months,"" said Marsh, who's playing a Test after eight months. ""I...worked my arse off...to get another opportunity,"" he added.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - All-rounder Mitchell Marsh is acutely aware he polarises Australian cricket fans but hopes forgoing his mum’s roast dinners as part of a new fitness regime might help win their respect. Marsh celebrated his recall to the side for the first time since last year’s Boxing Day test against India by taking 4-35 as Australia turned the screws on England in the fifth and final Ashes test at the Oval on Thursday. The hosts were 271-8 at stumps on day one after Jos Buttler’s unbeaten 64 rescued their innings. Having been in the team’s leadership group last year before he was dumped and lost his central contract, Marsh acknowledged his see-sawing form had made it difficult for home fans to warm to him. “Yeah, most of Australia hate me,” Marsh said before laughing. “Australians are very passionate, they love their cricket, they want people to do well.  “There’s no doubt I’ve had a lot of opportunity at test level and I haven’t quite nailed it,” added Marsh, who averaged 25.39 with the bat and 43.91 with the ball from his 31 previous tests. “But hopefully they can respect me for the fact I keep coming back and I love playing for Australia, I love the baggy green cap and I’ll keep trying and hopefully I’ll win them over one day.” The 27-year-old said there were times after he lost his central contract when he doubted he would be back in the Australian side. Personal issues had also affected him in the last year, including the suicide of a close friend, while his fitness and strength were also lacking, something that coach Justin Langer had asked him to work on. “Over the last six months I have put everything I’ve had in to it and I’ve changed my lifestyle a bit,” he said. “I don’t eat badly. I just eat a lot. My body just likes to put on weight easily and my mum likes to feed me. “I haven’t had as many roasts at home in the last six months, but it hasn’t been that hard. “There has been no secret recipe, I just worked my arse off hoping to get another opportunity.” Australia retained the Ashes with victory in the fourth test at Old Trafford and lead the series 2-1.

1602,Huawei offers to license 5G technologies to Western firms,"China's Huawei has offered to share its 5G technologies with Western firms to ease the security concerns raised by the US. CEO Ren Zhengfei said Huawei would give companies ""perpetual access"" to its existing 5G patents, codes and technical blueprints for a one-time fee. This would create more 5G players and a balance between China and the West, Zhengfei added.",Engadget,"Huawei's CEO Ren Zhengfei said the company is willing to help boost a western rival in the global 5G race as a way to ease tensions with the West. In a recent interview, Ren told The Economist Huawei would give another company ""perpetual access"" to its existing 5G patents, code and technical blueprints in return for a one-time fee.Ren went on to claim the license would give the buyer the freedom to modify Huawei's source code, so as to address any possible spying concerns. The potential cybersecurity threat Huawei presents to western nations has been a contentious issue among the Five Eyes, an intelligence-sharing alliance that is made up of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US. While Australia, New Zealand and the US have banned their respective national carriers from buying 5G equipment from Huawei, Canada and UK have yet to do the same. As part of this hypothetical deal, Huawei would keep all of its existing carrier contracts and continue to develop new 5G tech, as well as work to secure new sales contracts. Essentially, the company wants to reset the playing field and go from there.However, as The Economist notes, it's hard to say whether the plan is likely to work. First, it's unclear if the Chinese government would agree to Huawei essentially selling off a portion of its most valuable assets to a foreign company. Similarly, it's uncertain if there's a company out there that is actually interested in buying Huawei's 5G patents.Most of all, even if Huawei were to prop up a western rival, it's unlikely that would put the company in the US government's good books. As things currently stand, there are few things Democrats and Republicans agree on, but both mistrust Huawei. In July, a bipartisan group of House representatives and senators moved to block the Trump Administration from removing Huawei from the Commerce Department Entity List.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/12/huawei-boss-willing-license-5g-tech-ease-spying-fears/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This follows the new motor vehicle law recognising cab aggregators as marketplaces for the first time.",Entrackr,"Union government is in the midst of framing new guidelines for cab aggregator platforms addressing several issues, including the dynamic pricing of cab fares during peak hours.The government will likely allow surge pricing up to 3X in the new policy regulating the cab operators. Both industry leaders, Uber and Ola, have been rebuked by Indian Courts in the past for irrational pricing.Delhi High Court had banned the practice of surge pricing by app-based taxi aggregators in the national capital region in 2016.Customers, who have often complained of irregularities in cab prices will not be pleased by the new regulations as it will allow the ride-hailing services to charge as much as three times the regular fares.However, the cab aggregators have been defending the practice citing demand and supply issues and monetising the increased demands during periods of peak demand for cabs.The new regulations will also accommodate rules according to the new Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019. The recently implemented law has finally recognised cab aggregators by creating a new category for them.Companies like Ola, Uber and Rapido who have been operating in the grey area due to lack of official norms will now be recognised as online intermediaries or marketplaces, which can be used by passengers to connect with a driver for transportation.The proposed guidelines will also address the issues of passenger security, types of vehicles allowed and liability responsibility as provided in the new motor vehicle act. Supreme Court in July had asked the central government to draft a new law to regulate mobile app-based taxi service providers and address safety issues, particularly for women riders.The new framework will be enforceable across India, but the state governments will be allowed to make changes as per the needs of that particular state.In previous cases, states such as Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have banned the operations of bike taxis while Karnataka had implemented its own rules regarding surge prices.The development was reported by ET.",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/govt-uber-ola-cap-surge-prices-max-3x/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1607,New cancer treatment prevents hair loss from chemotherapy,Researchers at The University of Manchester claim to have found a way to prevent hair loss in cancer patients during chemotherapy. Researchers found that coating the hair follicles with CDK4/6 inhibitors may prevent hair loss. Researchers have claimed that as many as 8% of patients may refuse chemotherapy due to the 'psychological burden' of hair loss.,Times Now,"London: A novel method discovered recently by a group of researchers, including one of Indian-origin, shows how hair loss from chemotherapy can be prevented during cancer treatment in patients, arguably one of the most psychologically distressing side effects of modern cancer therapy. The study published in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine describes how damage to the hair follicles caused by taxanes, cancer drugs which can cause permanent hair loss, can be prevented.

To do this, the research team has exploited the properties of a newer class of drugs called CDK4/6 inhibitors, which block cell division and are already medically approved as so-called ""targeted"" cancer therapies.

""Although at first, this seems counterintuitive, we found that CDK4/6 inhibitors can be used temporarily to halt cell division without promoting additional toxic effects in the hair follicle. When we bathed organ-cultured human scalp hair follicles in CDK4/6 inhibitors, the hair follicles were much less susceptible to the damaging effects of taxanes,"" study lead author Talveen Purba from the University of Manchester said.

Taxanes are very important anti-cancer drugs commonly used to treat, for example, patients with breast or lung carcinoma and particularly cause anxieties among breast cancer patients for the very distressing and sometimes long-lasting hair loss taxanes can induce.

""A pivotal part of our study was to first get to grips with how exactly hair follicles responded to taxane chemotherapy, and we found that the specialised dividing cells at the base of the hair follicle that are critical for producing hair itself, and the stem cells from which they arise, are most vulnerable to taxanes.

""Therefore, we must protect these cells most from undesired chemotherapy effects -- but so that cancer does not profit from it,"" Purba said.

The researchers underscore that more work is desperately needed in this lamentably under-funded field of cancer medicine, where patients have waited for so long to see real breakthroughs in pharmacological hair loss prevention.

The 31-year-old dropped to the ground after getting hit post missing a pull shot on the bowling of Hardus Viljoen. He was rushed to hospital, where he was cleared of any serious injury.",CricTracker,"Caribbean Premier League (CPL) that was started back in 2013 has witnessed lots and lots of big moments during its reign and it is currently in its 6th successive season. On Thursday though every fan witnessed a terrifying incident in a match between Jamaica Tallawahs and St Lucia Zouks. It took away the breath of everyone while Andre Russell was batting.The incident took place in the 14th over of the match. Russell till then had faced 2 balls and was still waiting for his account of runs to get opened. On the 5th delivery of the over, the West Indies all-rounder failed to connect the short ball bowled by Hardus Viljoen which struck on his helmet near the right ear.AdvertisementIt appeared that there was no neck guard on the batsman’s helmet and the impact was so bad that he fell on the field at the very moment. After this, all the Zouks fielders then came to remove his helmet and Russell was then taken for the scan. In the meantime, physio was seen on the ground for medical assistance.Andre Russell rather got up soon after getting hit but fell on the ground again which increased concerns among fans and the players. The sight at that moment looked quite scary. It gave a flashback of an incident that took place in 2014 where the Australian Cricketer Phil Hughes passed away due to a severe bouncer which struck his head near the right ear exactly where Russell got hit.After the blow, the West Indies all-rounder was stretchered off the field. Later, in a medical update, the franchise confirmed that the star all-rounder hadn’t suffered a serious injury and is likely to be ruled out of the action for the next two days.Currently, Jamaica Tallawahs are on the last position with 3 direct losses in 3 matches which puts them in a tough situation. They are struggling to finish the drought of win. Last night Jamaica Tallawahs put up a score of 170 in 20 over’s, which the St Lucia Zouks chased down the total with 20 balls to spare.",https://www.crictracker.com/cpl-2019-andre-russell-stretchered-off-the-field-after-being-hit-on-the-back-of-neck/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Such attempts have not succeeded earlier and will not succeed now,"" First Secretary in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN Sandeep Kumar Bayyapu said Thursday.""The truth is that the delegation represents a geographical space that is now widely known as the hub of terrorism that has jeopardised innocent lives in our region and beyond.

Like most others, we remain convinced that the only remedy is a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, involving expansion in its permanent and non-permanent categories,"" he said.Bayyapu said that since performance assessment has become one of the focus areas at the United Nations, the Security Council too needs to prove its credibility and improve its performance.The annual report continues to be a statistical compilation of events, a bland summary and listing of meetings and outcome documents even though the membership of the General Assembly has repeatedly requested the Council that the annual report be more analytical and incisive rather than a mere narration of the meetings of the 15-nation organ of the UN, he said.""The debate on the annual report has become a ritual and a formality in a long list of formalities. There is a need to reinvigorate this interaction between the most representative organ of the United Nations and its most empowered brethren,"" he said.He stressed that the annual report of the Security Council must inform, highlight and analyse the measures that it has decided upon or taken to maintain international peace and security during the reporting period.Bayyapu also voiced concern that the report was not only lacking in substance but is submitted late in the year, almost towards the last quarter of the next year due to which it does not generate the attention needed for a proper discussion.""This needs to be rectified. There should be definite timelines for completing the report, circulating to wider GA members and holding the debate earlier not towards the close of the session,"" he said.The 74th session of the General Assembly will begin next week and the annual high-level session will begin soon thereafter.Bayyapu expressed disappointment that the annual report of the Security Council is short of analysis on the UN peacekeeping operations, the flagship tool for the maintenance of international peace and security.""There is little information on how peacekeeping operations are run, on the problems they face, on why certain mandates are set or changed, or on when and why they are strengthened, scaled-down or ended,"" he said.He stressed that a better partnership between the Security Council and the Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) is needed given that most peacekeepers are contributed by non-Council members, who put the lives of their troops at risk to serve the cause of international peace.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/pakistan-hub-of-terrorism-says-india-at-un-slams-islamabad-for-spreading-deceitful-narratives-on-kashmir/487977?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1623,Thailand allows 6 cannabis plants per household under draft law,"A party in Thailand's ruling coalition has proposed a draft law that allows up to six marijuana plants per household. This comes less than a year after the country legalised the drug for medicinal purposes and research. Under Thailand's current drug laws, recreational users of cannabis can incur penalties, including up to 10 years in prison for possession.",Reuters,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A party in Thailand’s ruling coalition has proposed a draft law that would allow Thais to grow a limited amount of cannabis at home, less than a year after the country legalised the drug for medicinal purposes and research.    Under Thailand’s current drug laws, recreational users of cannabis can incur tough penalties, including up to 10 years in prison for possession and hefty fines.       A senior lawmaker in the Bhumjaithai Party, third-largest partner in the coalition and in charge of the health ministry, said the draft law would allow up to six marijuana plants per household. Cannabis is still a drug under Thai law.  “The principle is for medical use, you can have it at home for ailments, but not smoke it on the street,” Supachai Jaisamut told Reuters.  It would also allow the sale of plants to licensed institutions under the supervision of an institute for that purpose, Supachai said. The proposed Plant-based Drug Institute would have authority to purchase, extract and export cannabidiol (CBD), the chemical derived from the cannabis plant, Supachai said, comparing it to the Californian model. He said the law could be passed in 6 months after November when parliament re-opens if there was enough government support. The proposal would deliver on an election promise of the Bhumjaithai Party, which campaigned on a policy to allow Thais to grow cannabis. Its supporters say the draft law is designed to develop the Thailand’s newly legal medical marijuana industry.   The Food and Drug Administration announced this month a cannabis business workshop as public and investor interest heighten after the policy was introduced.

The impact of the US-China trade war and other trade disputes is now being felt, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said. He added that the tariffs could trigger additional losses in future years.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tariffs imposed or threatened by the United States and China could shave 0.8% off global economic output in 2020 and trigger more losses in future years, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said trade tensions were beginning to affect a world economy already facing challenges including a weakening of manufacturing activity not seen since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters he had not seen the new IMF forecast, but did not expect the impact to be as significant in the United States. “I don’t see it in U.S. as that big an impact,” he said, when asked about the IMF forecast after an event hosted by the New York Times. Rice told a regularly scheduled IMF news conference that the global lender is to release a new revised economic outlook next month, but provided no details.  World economic activity remained subdued, with trade and geopolitical tensions causing uncertainty and eroding business confidence, investment and trade, he said. The IMF had previously forecast that the U.S.-China trade war and other trade disputes threatened future global growth, but Rice said the impact was now being felt. “Trade tensions .... are not only a threat, but are actually beginning to weigh down the dynamism in the global economy,” he said, adding U.S.-China tariffs “could potentially reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8% in 2020, with additional losses in future years.” That forecast is more gloomy than one earlier this year, when the IMF said tariffs already imposed and those planned could shave 0.5% off global economic output in 2020. Mark Hamrick, economic analyst at Bankrate, a New York-based consumer financial services company, said the new forecast reflected skepticism that Washington and Beijing would end the trade war. “Trade tensions have only grown. There is no agreement that is in sight,” Hamrick said, noting that growing concerns in the business sector were starting to bleed into consumer sentiment. Hamrick said the IMF assessment could fuel concerns about a U.S. recession after 11 years of expansion. Economists polled by Bankrate see a 41% chance of a recession by the time of the November 2020 presidential election, he said. Asked if the IMF anticipates a global recession, Rice said that was not in the fund’s baseline at the moment. He noted that the IMF had used words such as “very precarious,” “very fragile,” and “delicate” to describe the economic outlook. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s wait and see,” he said, noting the forthcoming world economic outlook would  provide greater clarity.  Rice stressed he was not hinting that the IMF planned to forecast a recession. The global lender this week unveiled a new “World Trade Uncertainty” index for 143 countries based on its country reports, using data back to 1996.  In the past year, the index jumped 10-fold from previous high in the wake of escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, it said.

However, as a part of investigation, a room was sealed by Special Investigation Team (SIT).”Also Read : ‘Set Up SIT to Probe Charges Against Chinmayanand’: SC to UP GovtWHAT DID THE SUPREME COURT SAY?The Supreme Court, on 4 September, ordered the transfer of the girl as well as her brother to other law colleges affiliated to Bareilly University saying, “for us, their future is important.”A bench comprising Justices R Banumathi and AS Bopanna was informed by the UP government that all arrangements had been made for the transfer of the girl and her brother to other college with hostel facilities.After the court's order to set up an SIT to probe the allegations levelled by the girl, the court stated that if any directions, including that of security are required, then the matter must be mentioned before the Allahabad High Court.WHAT IS THE SIT INVESTIGATION ABOUT?The law student reportedly filed a rape complaint against Chinmayanand with Delhi Police.The SIT, on the same day, called the family members of the survivor at the district Police lines and recorded their statements.Headed by Inspector General of Police Naveen Arora, the SIT has been set up by the UP government on the Supreme Court's order.The team has also visited the Mukukshu Ashram of the BJP leader and toured the five colleges run by the ashram, Principal Avinash Misra told PTI.Also Read :  Rape Charge Filed Against Chinmayanand, SIT  Begins QuestioningWHAT IS THE GIRL SAYING?Two days ago, the postgraduate student alleged that Chinmayanand raped her and physically exploited her for one year.Addressing the media in Shahjahanpur, she further claimed that the police was refusing to register the rape case.Also Read : ‘Exploited for a Year’: Student Alleges Rape by BJP’s ChinmayanandReferring to her hostel room, she said that she had all the proof in it and that it should have been opened in front of the media.She also alleged, “On Sunday, the SIT quizzed me for about 11 hours. I have told them about the rape. Even after telling them everything, they have not arrested Chinmayanand yet.”Citing her disappointment with the police, she alleged that the Shahjahanpur District Magistrate Indra Vikram Singh “issued threats,” and asked her father to file “a missing complaint.”WHAT IS CHINMAYAMAMD SAYING?Amid all the allegations, Chinmayanand has repeatedly claimed that it is a “conspiracy” to malign his image.Addressing the media on 4 September, he further said, “We were trying to change our college into university. We were on the verge of finalising a date for a meeting with the chief minister for the same. This matter was raised during our preparations for the university. I don’t know who are these people who are trying to hamper the development of Shahjahanpur,” reported IANS.His lawyer, Om Singh said that his client is innocent and is being framed. “The allegations will not hold water in court,” he said.Also Read : Conspiracy to End My College’s Growth: Chinmayanand Breaks SilenceDID YOU KNOW?Mouting trouble for Chinmayanand, on 11 September, a video purpotedly showing him naked and receving a massage by a woman surfaced on the Internet.Also Read : Alleged Video of Chinmayanand Getting Naked Massage Emerges OnlineChinmayanand's lawyer said, “I am sure the video is not authentic and should be sent to forensic lab for test. Action should be taken against such people who are trying to ruin the image of Swami ji.”Meanwhile, another video surfaced on Tuesday night, purportedly showing four young men and a woman planning to extort money from from Chinmayanand, IANS reported.Chinmayanand's name, however did not figure in the interaction among the five. Neither there are any leads to tell when and where the video was filmed.Earlier, Chinmayanand had managed to filed an FIR that he has been getting extortion calls.WHAT ARE THE POLITICIANS SAYING?Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi on Friday attacked the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over the Chinmayanand case, alleging that Yogi Adityanath’s “antics” have made it clear that the government has “nothing to do with women's security.”She asked why the state police has adopted a “lax approach” in dealing with the case.Earlier, Congress had criticised the BJP government at the Centre and in UP of “incompetence” in dealing with crimes against women.Nayak added, “A girl came forward and complained that she was raped by BJP leader Swami Chinmayanand for a year. Now there's this video where she's saying that she — the victim - was questioned by SIT (Special Investigation Team) for 11 hours on Sunday while the accused has not even been questioned for 11 minutes,” reported IANS.Gandhi had also compared the law student's case with the Unnao rape case and said, “If a woman complains against a BJP leader, far from getting justice, she is not even guaranteed of her safety.”THE BACKDROPThe law student was reported missing from Shahjahanpur on 23 August, a day after posted the video on Facebook alleging that “senior leader of the sant community” was harassing and threatening to kill her.She was traced to Rajasthan’s Dausa district on 30 August.The girl, however, alleged that she had left Uttar Pradesh with her three college friends to “protect herself”.Chinmayanand, who has blatantly denied the charges, has been booked under 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC based on the father’s complaint.(With inputs from PTI, IANS)Also Read : Alleged Video of Chinmayanand Getting Naked Massage Emerges Online(The Quint will no longer be on WhatsApp, owing to changes in its policies regarding news publishers.

1653,NZ PM proposes creating gun register after Christchurch shootings,New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern tabled a bill in the Parliament to create a register to track all the guns in the country. This has been proposed under gun law reforms following the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch in March. The bill also proposed gun licences in New Zealand be renewed every five years instead of every 10 years.,The New Indian Express,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand unveiled new legislation Friday aimed at ensuring only ""fit and proper"" people can own guns in the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks that killed 51 Muslim worshippers.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had immediately banned military-style semi-automatic rifles after the shootings in March but said further restrictions were needed to target the black market.""Owning a firearm is a privilege not a right,"" she told reporters in Christchurch on Friday.""That means we need to do all we can to ensure that only honest, law-abiding citizens are able to obtain firearms licences and use firearms.""Under the new legislation, a registry will be set up that is designed to track ownership of every legally owned firearm in the country.The measure also increases the jail term for supplying firearms to an unlicensed person from three months to two years, as well as tightening gun importation and sales.ALSO READ: New Zealand moves mosque shooting trial to avoid clash with RamadanPolice will determine if someone is ""fit and proper"" to hold a licence, with power to exclude anyone promoting extremism, convicted of violent crime or with mental health issues, including attempted suicide.The register, expected to take five years to complete, will contain details of the estimated 1.2 million firearms in New Zealand, for a population of around five million.Police Minister Stuart Nash said the existing gun legislation was introduced in 1983 and needed updating.The alleged Christchurch gunman Brenton Tarrant legally obtained an arsenal of rifles before embarking on the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's modern history.The self-avowed white supremacist is accused of opening fire at two mosques while live streaming his actions on social media.He has pleaded not guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 of attempted murder and engaging in a terrorist act.In addition to the semi-automatic ban, the first round of gun law reforms included a firearms buyback scheme allowing the public to hand in weapons before a six-month amnesty expires.The Christchurch killings rocked New Zealand and Ardern's gun reforms have been generally accepted in the South Pacific nation.There has been some opposition, including from the conservative ACT Party, which said law-abiding firearms owners were not receiving a fair hearing.""We also oppose a gun register because such an exercise will cost a significant sum of taxpayer money but will not capture the criminals and gang members who hold firearms,"" ACT leader David Seymour said.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/sep/13/new-zealand-tightens-gun-laws-again-after-mosque-massacre-2033037.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In the past 18 years, Saudi Arabia has denied any involvement in the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Two Saudi officials, Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy, had previously been named.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday said it would release the name of an individual sought by people who are suing the government of Saudi Arabia for alleged involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacking attacks.  U.S. prosecutors in New York said in a court filing that Attorney General William Barr had decided not to invoke state secrets and will share the person’s name with attorneys involved in the case. The decision could help victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and their family members, who charge in a long-running lawsuit that the Saudi government supported the hijackers who crashed jet liners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, killing nearly 3,000 people. The Saudi government has repeatedly denied involvement in the attacks. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.  The case, filed in 2003, received a boost in 2016 when Congress passed a law making it easier to sue foreign governments for alleged involvement in terrorism. The plaintiffs have been trying to obtain redacted material from a 2012 FBI report which indicated the agency was investigating two Saudi officials, Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy, and said there was evidence that a third, unnamed party had ordered them to help the hijackers. Attorneys will now get to learn the name of that person, though their identity will remain under seal. “The Saudis are running out of rope,” said Don Milgiori and Sean Carter, two attorneys involved in the case. “We look forward to more disclosures in the weeks and months ahead,” they said in a prepared statement.

The startup had in June raised $15.5-million Series A funding.",TechCrunch,"OkCredit, a Bangalore-based startup that enables small merchants to digitize their bookkeeping, has raised $67 million in a new financing round to grow its business in the nation.The Series B financing round for the two-year-old startup was led by Lightspeed and Tiger Global. The new round, which follows the Series A in June, increases OkCredit’s total raise to $83 million.OkCredit operates an eponymous mobile app that allows merchants to keep track of their day-to-day purchases and sales. Last month, OkCredit founders told TechCrunch in an interview that the app had amassed more than 5 million active merchants across 2,000 cities in India.Amy Wu, a partner at Lightspeed US, said OkCredit’s active users have grown 76 times since the beginning of the year. It’s one of the fastest-growing companies we’ve seen and reflects the incredible virality and network effects of the business,” Wu added.A wide range of merchants, from roadside vendors to grocery shop owners and pharmacies, have joined OkCredit.Even as more than 500 million users in India today are online, most merchants in the nation are yet to digitize their business, according to industry estimates. They still rely on large notebooks to keep a log of their transactions.“Technology has moved from collecting payments in cash, to using point-of-sale machines. More recently, QR codes, paper bills turned to printed bills. But the one thing that has not changed is the fact that most customers still purchase goods on credit recorded in a notebook,” Harsh Pokharna, chief executive of OkCredit said in a statement.Pokharna told TechCrunch today that the startup will use the capital to hire more people and grow its merchant user base. The startup also plans to build more products for merchants.Vyapar and KhataBook are two more startups in India that are attempting to solve a similar problem.In a statement, Harsha Kumar, a partner at Lightspeed, said, “technology adoption in India will happen across sectors and segments. For the longest time, mSME as a segment was ignored but we have seen through Udaan, OkCredit and other Lightspeed investments in the SME space that tech usage is growing rapidly.

1661,World's first malaria vaccine to be introduced in Kenya,"The world's first malaria vaccine is being rolled out in parts of Kenya after debuting in Ghana and Malawi earlier this year. More than 300,000 children are expected to receive the vaccine over the next three years. Malaria infected about 219 million people in 2017, killing around 435,000 of them, most of them babies and children in parts of Africa.",Reuters,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya on Friday began adding a malaria vaccine to its routine immunization schedule for babies and toddlers, becoming the third African country to roll out the vaccine for a disease that threatens children across the continent. Malaria, which kills one child globally every two minutes, is the top killer of children under five in the east African country. The vaccine - the world’s first against malaria - will be administered to children under two and could be crucial to efforts to combat the disease, health officials said. Other measures, such as nets to protect people from the mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite, have not proven adequate to halt transmission, the director general of Kenya’s health ministry, Wekesa Masasabi, told Reuters. “We still have an incidence of 27% (malaria infection) for children under five,” Masasabi said before Friday’s launch of the vaccine in the western county of Homa Bay.  The Homa Bay programme is the government’s first step toward creating awareness of the new vaccine, he said.  The injectable vaccine, called RTS,S or Mosquirix, was developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline to protect children from the most deadly form of malaria in Africa. In clinical trials it proved only partially effective and it needs to be given in a four-dose schedule, but it is the first regulator-approved vaccine against the disease. It has already been deployed in pilot programmes in Ghana and Malawi.  Malaria infected about 219 million people in 2017 and killed around 435,000. The vast majority of malaria deaths are among babies and children in the poorest parts of Africa. Due to ongoing transmission, half the world’s population is still at risk of contracting the disease.  The World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, said the Kenyan, Ghanaian and Malawian pilots would provide key information and data for a future WHO policy on broader use of the vaccine in sub-Saharan Africa.  A recent surge in malaria cases and deaths in the region is threatening gains in the fight against the disease, she said, adding that the vaccine “has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives.” Kenya plans to roll out RTS,S to eight of its 47 counties over the next two years, Masasabi said.  In a major report published last weekend, global health experts said malaria could be eradicated within a generation with the right tools, funding and political will.  Commissioned by The Lancet medical journal, the report contradicted the conclusions last month of a malaria review by the WHO. The experts urged the U.N. agency not to shy away from this “goal of epic proportions”.

""It will be distributed in October as the smog...penetrates Delhi in November. N95 masks that are considered best are being procured,"" he added. The CM also announced that the odd-even rule will be implemented again from November 4.",The New Indian Express,"NEW DELHI: In an attempt to wipe the tag of one of the most polluted cities in the world, the Delhi government on Friday has decided to fall back on its odd-even scheme that it first introduced in the city in 2016. This time the Aam Aadmi Party will implement the scheme from November 4-15. CM Arvind Kejriwal announced a seven-point action plan ‘Parali Pradushan’ ahead of a period of peak pollution and crop burning in the neighbouring states. The decision may be viewed as the government’s initiative to strike a connect with voters ahead of Assembly polls.
The scheme has been both a challenge and a channel for the government to fight the alarming pollution in Delhi. Even after huge criticism over its earlier attempts, the government is adamant in proving its efficacy in a third attempt.The CM said studies have shown that the scheme had reduced air pollution in Delhi by 10-13%, a claim that has been contested by many scientists. Even opposition leaders did not agree with the scheme. 
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari stressed that the rationing scheme was not needed and that Delhi would be pollution-free in the next two years. Gadkari, who inaugurated a CNG centre at Nagpur, said, “There is no such need (odd-even scheme) because the new ring road we’ve built is helping reduce pollution in Delhi to a certain extent.” However, Kejriwal said, “Pollution has started to reduce and Delhi seems to be the only city in the entire country where this positive development has begun. We don’t have to sit back and relax with 25% reduction..It should be reduced till it comes to the good range...10 or 11 months of the year. Delhi’s air has seen a marked improvement. But every November, because of the smoke that comes from Punjab and Haryana, Delhi turns into a gas chamber. The Centre and these states are trying to prevent this from happening. But until that happens, we must take steps to protect ourselves from the toxic air created due to crop burning,” Kejriwal said.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2019/sep/13/odd-even-rule-to-be-implemented-in-delhi-from-november-4-15-arvind-kejriwal-2033047.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He’s one of the limited partners in the fund.“Sequoia is investing about $4 million while remaining $1 million will come from angels. The contour of the transaction has been almost finalised, and if nothing goes wrong from here, then it will be announced within a month,” said two sources on condition of anonymity.Sources also emphasised that Lightspeed is also in conversation to invest around $3 million in FamPay. However, it’s in early talks. “If Lightspeed also joins, the round can go up to $8 million,” added sources.Entrackr‘s query to Sequoia and Lightspeed did not elicit an immediate response. We will update the post as and when they respond. Responding to our queries, Sambhav Jain, co-founder, FamPay said that the report is speculative and inaccurate.Founded by Kush Taneja and Sambhav Jain, FamPay allows a user to pay online and in-store through the mobile app, debit card and UPI. Focusing on a close group or family, FamPay can be used to split bills and send money without any paperwork, hidden charges and condition for minimum balance.FamPay attempts to build the future of banking and finance for children in India. It was a part of Y Combinator’s Summer batch 2019. The startup targets 250 million teenagers aged below 18, who aren’t able to access digital payments and bound to take physical cash from their parents.In a nutshell, it’s a shared account for family, just like a family plan offered by telecom companies. Adults can use it individually.Taneja and Jain have recently completed their engineering from IIT Roorkee. While Taneja has worked as product design and intern at ShareChat, Bolo and PhonePe, Jain was a part of the product team at Hotstar and AEON Learning.Product-wise, FamPay comes with a simple UI/UX to suit the audience using any payment app for the first time.

1688,Google to shut down shopping service 'Express' in next few weeks,"Google, which had earlier announced the shutdown of its US shopping service Google Express, in emails sent to users revealed that it will be closed in a few weeks. The features and functions of Express will be integrated into Google's new, global 'Shopping' platform. The Google Express apps will automatically update to become Google Shopping if already installed by users.",TechCrunch,"Google’s  failed online shopping service Google Express is closing in a few weeks, as its features will be merged into a revamped version of Google Shopping, Google says in an email sent to its customers this week. The company had already announced its plans to shutter the Google Express brand, as part of a wider redesign of how it approached online shopping. This included new advertising options for brands and online sellers, as well as a universal shopping cart across its platform of services, like Search, Shopping, Images, and even YouTube.While Google is characterizing Google Express’s closure as an “integration,” it’s really more of a sunsetting of a failed brand.Google Express was Google’s high-profile attempt to compete with Amazon for online shopping clicks and ad dollars buy creating a virtual mall on the web filled with top retailers’ products. Because Google is not a retailer itself, it did what it knows best — it organized information. At Google Express, you could find products from thousands of retailers — including big names like Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Best Buy, and others. And you could shop through a dedicated online storefront on the web, a Google Express mobile app, or even Google Assistant.In the latter case, Google Express partnered with retailers like Walmart and Target for deep integrations for voice-enabled shopping. As direct competitors with Amazon, these retailers didn’t want to offer third-party skills for Echo users or others on Amazon’s Alexa platform. Google represented a safer third-party platform for their experiments with voice commands and personalized shopping.But even several years after launch, Google Express had failed to offer any real threat to Amazon. Its retail partners, meanwhile, were building out their own fulfillment businesses for their customers’ online orders — like Walmart Grocery’s curbside pickup and delivery, for example, or Target’s Shipt, Drive Up, and Restock.Not too much later, Target and Walmart were pulling out or pulling back from Google Express, it was being reported. (Target says it continues to invest in the platform. Gizmodo had previously reported on how Target reshaped its relationship with Google Express after launch.)Google tried to downplay the news of Google Express’s demise by including it as just another part to the larger Google Shopping revamp. After all, it’s not a shutdown, the company implied. Its features were simply becoming a part of Google Shopping! Nothing to see here! Just a rebrand!But clearly, Google Express had been unable to establish itself in consumers’ minds as its own dedicated shopping destination and brand. If customers wanted an online mall, they already had one with either Amazon or Walmart and their vast third-party marketplaces where you could find just about anything you’d need. Nor had Google innovated (or acquired) across key areas like warehousing or logistics, while others like Amazon, Target, and Walmart had been spending billions.With Google Shopping, Google goes back to its search engine roots. It aims to simply capture consumers’ clicks, ad dollars and now conversions no matter where they are on Google’s sites — whether that’s shopping from Merch shelves under YouTube videos, browsing photos in a Pinterest-y manner on Google Images, or through more traditional Google searches for products where ads become shoppable, and shopping carts follow you around Google’s part of the web.In an email to Google Express shoppers that was sent this week, Google says Google Express will be integrated with Shopping in a few weeks’ time.The redesigned Google Shopping will then be available across the web and through apps for iOS and Android later this month. At that point, the Google Express apps will automatically update to become Google Shopping, if you already had them installed.The full email about Google Express’ closure is below: As expected, Google disputed the Google Express brand’s demise as a “shutdown.”“Google Express is now Google Shopping. The same stores and products, free delivery options, and easy checkout offered by Google Express will now be available through ‘Buy with Google‘ across surfaces,” a spokesperson said.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/11/google-express-to-close-in-a-few-weeks-will-become-part-of-google-shopping/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Subhasri, who was riding a two-wheeler, lost her balance and fell on the road. Eyewitnesses said that a tanker lorry coming from behind ran over her.",The News Minute,"Outside the mortuary of the Chromepet General Hospital in Chennai, a small crowd of youngsters were in shock, a few struggling to hold back their tears. They were friends of Subhasri Ravi, a 23-year-old techie who was killed around 2.30pm on Thursday at Palliakarani, on the 200-feet Radial stretch along the Thuraipakkam- Pallavaram road.Subhasri had been riding her two-wheeler when a hoarding erected on the road’s divider fell on her. Subhasri lost her balance, and as the bike veered off, she fell on the middle of the road. Eyewitnesses told the media that though the driver of a tanker lorry that had been coming from behind tried to apply brake, it rammed into the young woman. Though she was rushed to the Chromepet GH, she died within an hour. The hoardings had been erected on either sides of the road and on the divider by former AIADMK Councillor and Kancheepuram East MGR Mandram Assistant Secretary S Jayagopal to announce his son’s wedding. A high-profile wedding that saw even Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam attending it.An eyewitness Manimaran told the media, ""One hoarding was already coming loose and I went and tied it. The banner fell on her and she slipped. Though the lorry tried to swerve and stop, the driver could not. Most of the banners were loose and crooked.""
	The accident spotSubhasri who has become the latest victim of political apathy was an B.Tech graduate who was working in an IT company in Perungudi. The 23-year-old was reportedly returning home from her office. She was also planning on going to Canada in October to pursue her higher studies. St Thomas Mount Traffic Investigation Wing has arrested the lorry driver and filed a case against him. A case has been filed against Manoj, the driver who hails from Bihar, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including section 279 (rash driving), section 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others), and section 304A (causing death by negligence).Though the police station has been tightlipped about the details, sources say that no case has been filed against Jayagopal till Thursday night. ""We have filed a case against the person who put up the hoarding. We are not sure who it was outsourced to. If they had sought permission for it, the Revenue department will have the details. We will add names of the person who put it up and who gave order after investigation,"" Inspector Ravikumar of the St Thomas Mount station told TN.Despite multiple bans and High Court warnings, many politicians and political parties continue to erect hoardings and put up banners for every small event they are associated with. Though people are allowed to erect banners and hoarding after seeking police permission two weeks before, the High Court has repeatedly said that flex banners and hoardings of living persons cannot be put up. Moreover, rules dictate that the letters granting permission from the corporation be displayed on these banners.The AIADMK in particular is one of the biggest defaulters and despite being the ruling party, it has given scant regard to the court’s repeated orders. In November 2017, K Ragupathi, a software engineer from the US who had returned home to Coimbatore to meet a prospective bride, was killed after he rammed into an illegal wooden arch erected for MGR Centenary celebrations.

1701,"Smith learnt harsh lessons, will be better leader next time: Taylor","Former Australia captain Mark Taylor has said that he believes batsman Steve Smith can lead Australia again when he becomes eligible on April 1, 2020. ""(Smith) will be a better leader next time around because of the very harsh lessons he learnt,"" the 54-year-old added. ""I don't believe the additional responsibility of captaincy would affect his batting,"" Taylor further said.",Cricket Country,"Former skipper Mark Taylor on Thursday backed Steve Smith to captain Australia again after his incredible Ashes exploits, as support mounts for the 30-year-old to be given a second chance. Smith was banned for 12 months over a brazen attempt to alter the ball with sandpaper under his captaincy in a Cape Town Test, and slapped with a further year’s suspension from any leadership role which runs out at the end of March next year.ASHES 2019 FULL SCHEDULE | ASHES 2019 LATEST NEWSWhile wicketkeeper Tim Paine assumed the job in Tests and won praise for the way he helped the side retain the Ashes at Old Trafford last weekend, he will be 35 in December. Usman Khawaja and Travis Head have been touted as potential future leaders, but neither have performed in England while Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are bowlers, who rarely become captains.Taylor, who helped determine Smith’s ball-tampering penalty, along with the bans handed to David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, said he was the natural choice to take over.“I believe Smith will captain Australia again,” he said in a column for the Sydney Morning Herald. “I was on the Cricket Australia board that determined the penalties for Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft over the events of Cape Town and have no doubt he will be a better leader next time around because of the very harsh lessons he learnt.”Paine was widely criticised for his decision-making in the third Test at Headingley that Australia lost, but he bounced back admirably at Old Trafford and Taylor said he should retain the armband for the upcoming home summer series against Pakistan and New Zealand.But Smith would be waiting in the wings. “To me it’s not a matter of whether he (Smith) becomes captain again on April 1. It doesn’t have to happen that quickly,” he said. “But I’d like to think when Paine is finished as Test captain — whether that’s in six months’ time or two or three years — he would be a candidate to lead the side again.”Another ex-captain, Ian Chappell, has also backed Smith to again assume the role. “I think the problem for Australia will be there’s no one else I can see to captain that side,” he said recently, while Ricky Ponting stated he “wouldn’t have any problem with it at all”.“If the hierarchy at Cricket Australia have an issue with him ever being captain again, they would have given him a life ban, wouldn’t they?” Ponting said last month.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/i-believe-steve-smith-will-captain-australia-again-mark-taylor-890500?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
1705,Scientists create colour-changing smart skin inspired by chameleons,"Scientists have created a flexible smart skin that can change colour in response to the environment without changing shape. It was created by studying time-lapse videos of chameleons' phase-shifting skin and experiment with embedding photonic crystal arrays into flexible, water-containing polymers. Expanding or contracting the hydrogel changed the spacing in the arrays, leading to colour change.",Engadget,"Color-changing smart skin is nothing new, but scientists have had a hard time working out the kinks. Current smart skin is fragile and buckles after being exposed to varying temperatures. To help remedy that problem, scientists turned to analyzing detailed videos of chameleons' skin. This helped them develop a far more resilient take on this tech, which shows a more promising future for color-changing gear.Chameleons can change their colors thanks to photonic crystals in their skin. As they tense or relax their muscles, the light reflects in a different pattern, resulting in a change of color. The problem with synthetic color-changing skin is in the hydrogel that the photonic crystals are packed into: After expanding and contracting, the large amount of crystals would cause the medium to seize up. Khalid Salaita and his colleagues have solved this problem by concluding that less is more.The team watched time-lapse videos of chameleons' phase-shifting skin and realized that the reptiles have fewer skin cells with photonic crystals than previously thought. By packing fewer photonic crystals in a thin layer of hydrogel, and then placing that slice on a larger layer of colorless hydrogel, the smart skin can expand and contract without issue. As the temperature changes or sunlight hits the surface, the material changes color.ACS Nano, a peer-reviewed journal focused on nanotechnology where this study was published, notes that smart skin may have applications in camouflage, signaling and anti-counterfeiting. MIT's color-changing ink, meanwhile, could let users change patterns and colors of their shoes, cars and more. Picking a color for an expensive gadget like a smartphone can be a stressful one; you're going to have to live with that choice for years. But with smart skin, we may eventually be able to change the colors of our gadgets as frequently as we swap out our wallpaper backgrounds.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/12/color-changing-smart-skin-upgrade/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The bomber blew up an explosives-laden minibus at the entrance to the camp in Chahar Asyab district, killing the four special forces members and wounding another three, the Defence Ministry said in a statement. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, which he said killed more than 200 commandos. The insurgents routinely issue exaggerated casualty claims. Mujahid said the bomber had been infiltrated into the base well before the attack. The latest attack underscored expectations of an escalation in violence following U.S. President Donald Trump’s sudden cancellation of the talks with the Taliban aimed at withdrawing U.S. troops and ending 18 years of war in Afghanistan. In Washington, Trump’s nominee to be the secretary of the U.S. Army said walking away from the talks was the correct decision.  “I think that it was the right decision to step back from the table and try to look at how do you get to a framework to bring a political end state to the conflict,” Ryan McCarthy told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.  McCarthy said that he believed that the United States would continue to need not only a counterterrorism capability, but also the ability to advise and assist Afghan security forces. “We can’t take our eye of the ball there until a time where there is a much greater maturity in the strength within the Afghan government,” McCarthy added.

1714,"Habibie, Indonesian Prez during transition to democracy, dies","Indonesia's ex-President BJ Habibie, who served during the country's transition to democracy in 1998, passed away aged 83 on Wednesday after suffering from heart failure. Thousands of people reportedly lined the streets as Habibie's cortege moved for a state funeral. Habibie oversaw economic and democratic reforms during 17 months in office, after ex-President Suharto stepped down after 32 years.",Reuters,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thousands of people gathered in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Thursday to mourn the death of former president B.J. Habibie, who came to power as the nation endured a turbulent transition to democracy after former strongman Suharto stepped down in 1998. The 83-year-old Habibie had been suffering heart failure, his son Tariq Kemal Habibie told Metro TV late on Wednesday. People lined the streets as the cortege drove through central Jakarta for the state funeral at the Kalibata Heroes Memorial Park, where President Joko Widodo was set to lead the ceremony.  An engineer by training, Habibie succeeded Suharto as third president of the world’s fourth-largest nation just months after becoming his deputy, as the country sank into spasms of rioting and economic upheaval following the Asian financial crisis.  Taking over from Suharto, who had ruled the world’s most populous Muslim majority country with an iron fist for 32 years, Habibie held power for just 17 months. It fell to Habibie to oversee unpopular economic reforms prescribed by the International Monetary Fund at the height of the financial crisis, that were needed to bring inflation down from more than 80% and stabilize a rupiah currency after its value had crashed. Though he was a product of Suharto’s “New Order” administration, which gave a strong political role to the military and stifled opponents, Habibie oversaw democratic reforms to free political prisoners and allow press freedom. In an abrupt change to longheld policy, he also agreed to a referendum for the people of former Portuguese colony East Timor, which had been annexed in 1976 following an invasion by Indonesian troops in December 1975. The referendum in 1999 resulted in a vote for independence and unleashed a wave of violence.  Habibie also eased discriminatory policies against Indonesia’s ethnic Chinese minority, including allowing the speaking and teaching of Mandarin and use of Chinese names that was previously discouraged by Suharto. He was known for his quest to turn Indonesia into a technological powerhouse, including trying to develop a national aircraft industry. At the hospital shortly after Habibie’s demise, President Widodo described him as “the father of technology in Indonesia.” Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister of neighboring Malaysia, posted his condolences on Twitter and said the death of Habibie was a “big loss.”   The U.S. White House, in a statement, praised Habibie’s “great leadership in preserving Indonesia’s unity.” For many ordinary Indonesians, it was the love story behind Habibie’s marriage to his late wife, Hasri Ainun Habibie, that most touched their hearts, and was celebrated in two popular movies. Ainun died in 2010.  “His love for his wife was legendary,” wrote Kornelius Purba, a senior journalist for the Jakarta Post, in a column on     Thursday.

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory had beamed a radio frequency to Vikram to establish contact, the report added. Chandrayaan-2's Vikram lander made a hard landing on the Moon on September 7.",Times Now,"It has been five days since September 7 since Chandrayaan 2's Vikram lander made a hard landing on the moon and has been lying motionless since. Multiple attempts to revive communication with the Vikram lander have seemed fruitless as ISRO races against time to establish some form of communication with the lander before the landing location goes dark.National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Jet Propulsion laboratory had sent a radio frequency to Vikram in order to establish contact with the lander. In a report by the Times of India, NASA was quoted saying they were trying to contact Vikram through its deep space network (DSN) as a part of its contract with ISRO.The idea of reviving the Vikram lander is getting slimmer and slimmer considering Vikram has a life of one lunar day. The one lunar day cycle which equals 14 Earth days, Vikram lander will stay exposed to sun rays but post-September 20-21, the probability of reviving the Vikram will become close to zero.""Attempts are being made to re-establish communication links with the moon lander Vikram. The attempts will be made till September 20-21 when the sunlight will be there in the area where the Vikram has landed,"" an ISRO official preferring anonymity told IANS.Astronomer Scott Tilley in a series of tweets has also confirmed the fact that NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) station situated in California has been beaming the radio frequency to the lander. Scott Tilley Citizen Scientist, as called by NASA shot to fame when he found NASA's lost IMAGE satellite back in 2005. Scott in a series of tweets explained that the DSN 24 would beam up to the Vikram lander and found a mysterious signal circulating which was found to be China's Chang'e 4. #DSN 24 Goldstone is setting up for another go for #VikramLander tonight. Note the weird reported downlink. Also note the antenna is not point at the #Moon. This indicates to me they are testing still.

Here's an eerie recording of the searcher's signal reflected off the Moon and back to Earth via EME (Earth Moon Earth) on 2103.7MHz.""When sending a signal to the lander, the Moon behaves like a radio reflector and then beams back the signal partially which can be found on Earth after the 8,00,000 round trip.Scott Tilley stated in the TOI report that the DSN 24 has been sending signals on the Lander's uplink frequency for the last two days now and that other DSN stations could be doing the same. #DSN 24 at Goldstone starts early just after local Moonrise signally for #VikramLander. pic.twitter.com/mdv730p6vW NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has DSN ground station in three places - Goldstone, South California (US), Madrid (Spain), and Canberra (Australia). The three DSN stations are located at 120 degrees apart which ensures that any satellite in space will be able to communicate with at least one station at all times. Every site has four large antennas minimum - ranging from 26 metres to up to 70 metres in diameter and is also capable of providing radio communications with more than one spacecraft at all times. NASA's 'passive payload' laser reflector array was installed on the Vikram lander which was meant to track the exact position of the lander and the landing spot as well. The laser reflector was also capable of calculating the exact distance from the Earth to the Moon. The accuracy of distance would have helped NASA plan their future missions to the moon. However, after Vikram's hard landing, the future of the laser reflector array is unknown.Also, a lot of significant data from the Chandrayaan 2's eight advanced payloads are expected which will help NASA with 3D mapping and also clear images of the South Pole region of the Moon. It is because NASA has been planning to send a manned mission to the South Pole of the moon by 2024 under their Artemis programme and hence wants to know the South Pole side of the moon better. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/chandrayaan-2-nasa-trying-to-help-isro-with-its-deep-space-antennas-attempts-to-contact-vikram-lander/487507?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I've been observing senior constables who retired from services as constables after serving 35-40 years without any promotion,"" he added.",The News Minute,"For the past one year, 29-year-old Siddanthi Prathap, a constable working in Hyderabad’s Charminar police station, has been trying to get married. However, prospective brides have been rejecting his proposal as he is a constable. Upset over the constant rejection, Prathap decided to quit the service and submitted his resignation letter to the Hyderabad Police Commissioner earlier on Saturday – which has now gone viral.Prathap, who is an engineering graduate, joined the service in 2014. In his resignation letter he said that he was ‘highly disturbed and depressed with the job’ after being rejected by prospective brides, who told him that they didn’t want to marry him due to his job as a constable, which did not have much benefits, had limited growth and long working hours.“As I am a constable one of the marriage proposals was rejected. Later I asked my relatives why the girl rejected, and they said that constables will work for 24 hours,” (sic) Prathap said in his letter. He stated that the prospective bride pointed out that there was no growth in the job, adding that Prathap would retire as a constable. “For which I was highly disturbed and depressed with my job,” he further wrote.Raising some very pertinent points about the work conditions of police constables, he added, “I have been observing senior constables who retired from services as constables after serving 35-40 years without any promotion in the job… In other departments, SI and above rank officers are given promotions and other benefits such as vehicle and petrol, but for constables there are no promotions or other allowances.”Speaking to TNM, Prathap said, “I have been trying to get married for the past one year. I met two prospective brides from Hyderabad, but they rejected my proposal due to my job as a constable. So I decided to quit.”However, Prathap’s parents are against the idea. “My parents want me to continue with the service. ‘You worked so hard to get this job, why do you want to quit,’ they say,” Prathap said, adding, “I can get brides from other rural districts and towns, but I want an educated woman from the city. As I grew up in a city, I want a woman from an urban area.”Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar has directed the department to offer counseling to Prathap so that he may reconsider his decision.“I’m not sure now.

1730,China offered oil & gas deal to ignore South China Sea ruling: Duterte,Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said that his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had offered his country a controlling stake in a joint energy deal if he ignored a South China Sea ruling against China. The Permanent Court of Arbitration had in 2016 clarified maritime boundaries and invalidated China's claims to almost the entire South China Sea.,Reuters,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said his Chinese counterpart has offered Manila a controlling stake in a joint energy venture in the South China Sea, if it sets aside an international arbitral award that went against Beijing. Duterte said Chinese President Xi Jinping told him during their recent meeting that if he ignored the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s 2016 ruling, China would agree to be the junior partner in a joint venture to develop gas deposits at the Reed Bank, located within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  “Set aside the arbitral ruling,” Duterte was quoted as telling reporters late Tuesday in remarks provided by his office on Wednesday.  “Set aside your claim,” he said, quoting Xi. “Then allow everybody connected with the Chinese companies. They want to explore. If there is something, they said, we will be gracious enough to give you 60%, only 40% will be theirs. That is the promise of Xi Jinping.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not give specifics at a briefing on Wednesday on the exchange between the presidents, but said Xi noted that cooperation would yield greater progress in exploiting the sea’s resources.  Hua said Duterte had expressed willingness to hasten maritime oil and gas exploration and development cooperation between China and the Philippines. With regard to some “specific situations,” working groups between the two sides would consult closely, she said. The tribunal in The Hague clarified maritime boundaries and the Philippines’ sovereign entitlements, and in doing so, invalidated China’s claims to almost the entire South China Sea. China does not recognize the ruling.  Duterte has sought to befriend Xi, hoping to secure billions of dollars of investment, avoiding challenging China over its activities in the South China Sea, including its militarized artificial islands. Any agreement to forget the arbitral award and team up with China would be a major setback to other claimants, especially Vietnam and Malaysia, which like the Philippines have experienced repeated challenges from China’s coastguard inside their EEZs. The United States has called that bullying and coercion aimed at denying rivals’ access to their energy assets. Duterte did not say if he had agreed to Xi’s offer, but said the part of the arbitral award that referred to the EEZ “we will ignore to come up with an economic activity”. The tribunal said the Philippines had legal rights to exploit gas deposits that China also claims at the Reed Bank, about 85 miles (140km) off the Philippine coast. The Philippines only accessible gas resources at the Malampaya fields are set to run out by 2024. A joint project with China has been talked about for decades, but has gone nowhere because of the competing claims. Joint activity could be deemed as legitimizing the other side’s claim, or even relinquishing sovereign rights. Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin on Wednesday told news channel ANC that a preliminary agreement between China and the Philippines would avoid stating which country was entitled to the gas. “It’s very clear - no legal position is compromised if we enter into this agreement,” Locsin said, adding that putting aside the arbitration case was immaterial, because an international court had already made its decision. “It’s final and binding,” he added.

1731,US briefly overtakes Saudi Arabia as world's top oil exporter,"The US briefly overtook Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil exporter in June, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday. Record shale production helped the US ship almost 9 million barrels a day of crude and oil products in June. Saudi reclaimed the top exporter's spot in July and August as hurricanes disrupted US production, the IEA said.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil demand is weathering economic headwinds, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday, buoyed by lower prices brought on by abundant supply as the United States briefly dethroned Saudi Arabia as the world’s top exporter. “With oil prices currently about 20% lower than a year ago, there will be support for consumers,” the IEA said in its monthly report. “Booming shale production has allowed the U.S. to close in on, and briefly overtake, Saudi Arabia as the world’s top oil exporter ... in June, after crude exports surged above 3 million barrels per day (bpd).”  The Paris-based agency maintained its estimate for growth in global oil demand during 2019 at 1.1 million bpd and 1.3 million bpd for next year, assuming no further breakdown in U.S.-China trade talks and citing an easing of tensions around Iran. A rebound in U.S. production following Hurricane Dorian along with steep output growth from Brazil and the North Sea were set to drive production from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) up sharply, it added. U.S. crude exports spiked to more than 3 million bpd in June, as Saudi Arabia cut output sharply and Russia grappled with contamination in one of its main export pipelines. Non-OPEC production growth is seen rising to 2.3 million bpd in 2020, up 400,000 from this year. Meanwhile, demand for OPEC crude is set to reach 28.3 million bpd in the first half of 2020, 1.4 million bpd less than the group produced in August. The discrepancy may prompt OPEC and its allies including Russia to revisit their production-curbing pact. “The implied market balance (will be) returning to a significant surplus and placing pressure on prices,” the IEA said. “The challenge of market management remains a daunting one well into 2020.” Russia, Iraq and Nigeria in August produced 600,000 bpd more than their quotas in the supply pact, the IEA said, but Saudi Arabia cut by more than it had pledged, keeping the overall agreement intact. OPEC member Iran continued to suffer under U.S. sanctions, with exports nearly halving month-on-month in August to just 200,000 bpd. A year earlier, they were at 2.1 million bpd.

The new 'Local Voice Control' extension acts as a backup and is meant to increase the resiliency of Alexa's cloud-based capabilities. The feature will allow users in search and navigation as well as car control.",Engadget,"Having an Alexa-enabled car is convenient if you want to make a call, check the weather or order groceries while you drive. But that convenience quickly disintegrates when you drive through tunnels, parking garages or remote areas and lose signal. Amazon wants to fix that. Today, it released version 2.0 of its Alexa Auto SDK, which now comes with a bunch of offline functions.With the new SDK, users can ask Alexa to do things like turn on the AC, tune the radio or make a call -- even when connectivity is intermittent or nonexistent. That's thanks to a ""Local Voice Control"" extension that allows automakers to add a scaled-down version of Alexa's cloud-based service to a vehicle's infotainment system. It acts as a backup and is meant to increase the resiliency of Alexa's cloud-based capabilities.Amazon introduced the Alexa Auto SDK last year, making the tools accessible to all developers via GitHub. Audi, BMW and Toyota have all added Alexa capabilities to their infotainment systems. But not all automakers have signed on. GM recently announced it would bring Google Assistant to Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac. The brand of voice-assistant that automakers choose could become an important selling point. According to a JD Power study conducted for Amazon, 76 percent of respondents said they want the same brand of voice service in both their home and their next vehicle.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/11/alexa-auto-sdk-offline-functions/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, Steve Mbikayi, said the derailment happened around 3 a.m. local time (0100 GMT), near the town of Mayibaridi, and gave a provisional death toll of 50. But the governor of Tanganyika, Zoe Kabila, gave a lower estimate: 10 people killed and 30 injured. He said three of the train’s carriages had come off the tracks. Mbikayi later told Reuters the ministry was aware of the contradictory death tolls and was trying to establish the exact number. Deadly transport accidents are common in Democratic Republic of Congo due to poor infrastructure and lack of regulation. The national railway company confirmed an accident had taken place. Hubert Tshiakama, the company’s head of operations, said the untouched front carriages of the train were once again on their way to the town of Kalemie.  “For now, we cannot determine the causes of the accident,” he said.

Despite the increase, inflation is still below the Reserve Bank of India's target of 4%. The CPI inflation data released by the government shows the rise in prices was mainly driven by the price rise in food items.",The Financial Express,"The retail inflation rate of items such as household goods, fuel, food, etc, have touched a 10-month high in August. CPI inflation rate stood at 3.21 per cent in the month, which was 3.15 per cent in July 2019. However, despite the increase, the inflation rate is still below the RBI’s target of 4 per cent. The market consensus on the inflation rate was earlier projected at 3.35 per cent. The CPI inflation data released by the government today shows that the rise in prices was mainly driven by the price rise in food items. Food inflation (CFPI) surged to 2.99 per cent in August from 2.36 per cent in July.  “With the CPI inflation recording only a mild increase in August 2019 despite the sharp uptick in the food inflation, we continue to expect the MPC to reduce the repo rate by 15-25 bps in the October 2019 policy review, given the continuing concerns related to economic growth,” said Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA.Meanwhile, the industrial production has grown at 4.3 per cent in July 2019, improving substantially from 2 per cent in the previous month. However, the production of capital goods and consumer durables significantly contracted on-year in July. In terms of industries, thirteen out of the twenty-three industry groups in the manufacturing sector have shown positive growth during the month of July, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI).Also Read: Onion price rise: Centre asks Delhi govt to sell onion via ration shops, civil supplies department at Rs 23.90/kgEarlier in June, IIP growth fell to a meagre 2 per cent, from 4.6 per cent in May. The slowdown was mainly attributed to the weakness in mining and manufacturing. Manufacturing of primary goods grew at just 0.5 per cent in June, which was at 9.2 per cent a year ago.  India’s GDP growth hit a 6-year low in the fiscal first quarter, mainly pulled down by weak demand in construction, manufacturing, infrastructure and construction. While a certain level of food inflation may help the farmers to increase their income, the improvement in industrial production has given some hope amid the slowdown. The government is consistently meeting industry representatives to steer the Indian industry out of the slowdown.

There aren't a lot of details available on the run or exterior shots to show how close to stock the sedan is. In a description, Tesla said this Model S is equipped with its ""Plaid powertrain"" (which continues the Spaceballs reference by going a step beyond Ludicrous) and a chassis prototype.In 2016, Musk tweeted that Plaid would be reserved for the upcoming Roadster, so it appears that plans have changed. He explained today in another tweet that the triple motor Plaid setup is ""about a year away,"" with plans to make it available into the Model S, X and Roadster, but not the cheaper/smaller Model 3 or Y.The only thing beyond Ludicrous is PlaidYes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production & applies to S,X & Roadster, but not 3 or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors.This isn't quite the Taycan-fighting Nürburgring run Musk had initially promised we'd see this week, but he later mentioned the company would need to do more review and testing ahead of the attempt.Our friends at Autoblog have picked up spy shots of a modified Model S P100D that is, as Musk promised, driving around the German roadway right now, so hopefully the battle between sporty EVs will get some comparable data soon.Update: CNBC notes that, according to a raceway spokesperson, official times can only be set during sanctioned events.

The bodyguard bound the worker's hands, kicked him and forced him to kiss her feet. She allegedly got angry when she saw the worker filming her on his phone.",Reuters,"PARIS (Reuters) - The daughter of the King of Saudi Arabia was complicit in beating up and briefly kidnapping a workman in her luxury flat Paris, a French court ruled on Thursday, sentencing the princess to a 10-month suspended prison sentence. Speaking after the verdict, Princess Hassa bint Salman’s French lawyer said most of the declarations made by workman Ashraf Eid were false and that an appeal would be lodged.  According to the initial indictment, Ashraf Eid told police that the princess’ bodyguard bound his hands, punched and kicked him and forced him to kiss the princess’ feet after she accused him of filming her on his cell phone. He told investigators his phone was forcibly taken from him and that as he was being beaten, Princess Hassa had treated him like a dog, telling him “you’ll see how you speak to a princess, how you speak to the royal family.” Defence lawyer Emmanuel Moyne disputed the court’s conclusions. “There was no theft and moreover there was no violence. All the investigators’ findings, the medical certificates demonstrate that the accusations made by Mr Eid are fanciful,” Moyne told reporters.    The princess, 43, sister of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has consistently denied any wrongdoing through her lawyers. She was not in court for the verdict. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling would complicate relations between Paris and Riyadh.  France has nurtured close ties with Saudi Arabia but those ties have been tested by President Emmanuel Macron’s determination to salvage Iran’s nuclear accord, which Saudi Arabia, alongside the United States, has adamantly opposed. The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Saudi royalty has faced legal problems in France before. In 2013, a French court ordered that the French assets of Saudi Princess Maha al-Sudairi, wife of former interior minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, be seized over unpaid bills at a luxury hotel totalling almost 6 million euros ($6.7 million).

We need to demotivate the members of the proscribed organisation and bring them down to the mainstream.""Earlier, during his maiden visit to the United States in July, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had made a similar revelation that his country still has about 30,000 to 40,000 militants ""who have been trained and fought in some part of Afghanistan or Kashmir.""Khan had also said that before his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government came into power, the governments did not have the ""political will"" to disarm militant groups operating on their soil.During a separate event, the Pakistani Prime Minister also said that they had 40 different militant groups operating within its borders.  Minister Shah's comments seem to be a face-saving measure ahead of the upcoming meeting of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in October.The watchdog is expected to submit its final evaluation report on Islamabad's action plan to curb terror financing next month. Last month, the FATF's regional affiliate Asia-Pacific Group (APG) had put Pakistan in the enhanced expedited follow-up list, a category reserved for countries having major deficiencies in their anti-money-laundering and counter-financing of terrorism framework and implementation.In another major embarrassing admission during the talk show, the minister also stated that Islamabad has failed to get support from the international community over its stand on Kashmir issue.Shah, in his remarks, blamed Pakistan ""ruling elite"" including Khan for ""destroying"" the image of the country, a day after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, during the 42nd UNHRC session in Geneva, claimed that India has transformed Jammu and Kashmir into the largest ""caged prison in this planet"" after the abrogation of Article 370 and that the human rights were being ""trampled with impunity"" there.

1799,Gilgit-Baltistan technically India's part: Ex-European Union official,"Former official of European Union Brian Toll supported India's move to revoke Article 370 and said Gilgit-Baltistan, which is currently under Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, is ""technically a part of India"". ""The [revoking] of Article 370 is actually about giving more economic opportunities to the people in Kashmir, according to the government. Let's hope it works,"" he stated.",Times Now,"Geneva: Brian Toll, ex-director of European Commission, has called Gilgit-Baltistan “technically a part of India”. Toll gave this statement while speaking on the abrogation of Article 370. He further said that the revocation of the Article was actually giving economic opportunities to the people in Kashmir.Speaking on the overall issue and Gilgit-Baltistan, Toll said, “It is very important to see the overall issue and Gilgit-Baltistan finding its place in the world order, having a voice and being able to express itself, not being controlled from Pakistan's central Islamabad.”Apart from opportunities for economic development, the region needs to have its people be represented in relevant political bodies, said Toll.While Pakistan has been raising a hue and cry over India’s decision to end special status to Jammu and Kashmir, it routinely ignores the fact that just over a year back it had illegitimately seized all powers from the natives of Gilgit-Baltistan.On May 21 last year, the Imran Khan-led PTI government promulgated 'Gilgit Baltistan Order, 2018', thereby replacing the Gilgit Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order of 2009'. This move was opposed by the locals as it was done without consulting them. It should be noted that India too had lodged a strong protest against this move.The 'Gilgit-Baltistan Order, 2018' ended the powers of Gilgit Baltistan Council and authorised the prime minister of Pakistan with complete authority over the region.After the declaration, all the powers of the local bodies were taken away including the authority to levy taxes. The new order cannot be challenged including in the courts.Apart from this order, the Pakistani government also tampered with the justice system of Gilgit-Baltistan with Pakistan PM having a say in choosing the hierarchy of the judiciary of the region, reported IANS.While the locals termed the move as just another step by the government to further suppress the indigenous people of the region. Pakistan had captured the region by force in 1947 and has been occupying it illegally since then.Lodging strong protest against the Pakistan government's move, the External Affairs Ministry summoned Pakistan's Deputy High Commissioner in Delhi clearly conveying that the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir which also includes the so-called 'Gilgit-Baltistan' areas belongs to India by virtue of its accession in 1947.Pakistan has conveniently ignored the large-scale human rights violations being carried out by its forces in Gilgit-Baltistan.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/gilgit-baltistan-is-technically-part-of-india-ex-director-of-european-commission/487218?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1830,Amazon allegedly lists some toys without confirming their safety,"Amazon allegedly allows the sale of some toys before verifying the ""required safety documentation"", as per an email seen by CNBC. Amazon reportedly asked some sellers for the document to be submitted by September 9, two weeks after they started selling their products. This comes after recent reports which claimed that over 4,000 unsafe products were found listed on Amazon.",Engadget,"Some toys may appear on Amazon without being vetted for safety. According to a CNBC report, multiple third-party sellers say they were only asked for proof of safety compliance weeks after their products were listed for sale. While the practice might help speed up the listing process, it could also lead to unsafe products being sold on Amazon.An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that the company requests safety documentation ""very shortly"" after a product is listed by a third party seller. In an email statement, the company said it regularly contacts selling partners to request safety documentation. Sellers who do not provide the required documentation are removed immediately.That practice leaves a window in which unsafe toys could potentially be sold to consumers. To make matters worse, Amazon recently came under fire for selling thousands of items that federal agencies had deemed unsafe. After a Wall Street Journal investigation discovered everything from unregistered pesticides to banned toys on the site, three senators wrote a letter asking Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to launch a ""sweeping internal investigation"" into the company's safety policies.

1837,Water vapour found on 'super-Earth' in habitable zone in a first,"NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has helped astronomers find evidence of water vapour on a 'super-Earth' exoplanet in its star's ""habitable zone"" for the first time. The planet, K2-18b, is around 110 light-years away with temperatures neither too hot nor too cold which can support the presence of liquid water. However, scientists said it likely has a very high-pressure atmosphere.",Engadget,"Water vapor is common in gas giants; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all have H2O floating around in their atmospheres. But water on a rocky planet is exceedingly rare, making the discovery of water vapor -- and possibly even rain -- on the exoplanet K2-18 b a surprising breakthrough.A team at the Institute for Research on Exoplanets at the Université de Montréal published their findings yesterday. Led by Björn Benneke, their work (which has yet to be peer reviewed) points to the possibility that K2-18 b is habitable thanks to the presence of water and hydrogen, as well as the exoplanet's location in the Goldilocks zone. The Goldilocks zone is a range relative to a star where the temperature is not too hot and not too cold to support life. But while the temperature range and presence of water are good signs, K2-18 b isn't necessarily habitable. The exoplanet isn't a gas giant, but it does have a thick, high-pressure atmosphere that likely envelops a large, rocky core. Due to the crushing pressure, humans wouldn't be able to walk on the planet's surface; it would be more of a Cloud City situation, with pods floating in the gaseous atmosphere.K2-18 b is the least massive exoplanet to have water vapor detected in its atmosphere. The planet may even have rain clouds -- though the researchers weren't able to confirm that yet. As the water condenses into liquid, the drops would fall toward the core, then revert to gas as the atmospheric pressure increases. The gas would rise back up to the cloud layer and repeat the cycle.Benneke and his fellow researchers will follow up their work in the 2020s, after the James Webb Space Telescope is launched in 2021. This new telescope is even more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, which the team used to analyze K2-18 b as it passed in front of its star. A more detailed look through the James Webb Space Telescope will help confirm the presence of rain on the planet, and will allow researchers to find even more Earth-like planets.Each passing decade has lead to a discovery that changes how we think about our universe: Dark energy was confirmed in the 2000s and the 2010s saw the first true confirmation of a black hole. The 2020s may be the decade when we find that the Earth, with its dry land and liquid oceans, isn't quite as unique as we currently believe.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/11/water-vapor-exoplanet-rocky-core/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
