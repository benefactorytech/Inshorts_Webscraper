Especially those who thought it was all over when Federer had 16-17 and Rafa had 14,"" he said.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Roger Federer will not be losing any sleep over whether rival Rafa Nadal can match his men�s record 20 Grand Slam singles titles, according to his long-term coach Severin Luthi. The 38-year-old Swiss began the year three ahead of second-placed Nadal�s haul but the Spaniard claimed a 12th French Open title this year followed up by winning the U.S. Open this month. It has re-energised the GOAT (greatest of all time) debate with Nadal, who has 19 slams, looking back to his best after injury concerns earlier this year. Never in his career has Nadal been only one Grand Slam title behind Federer, who squandered two match points against Novak Djokovic in this year�s Wimbledon final. �No, I don�t think he stresses (about Nadal catching him up),� Swiss Luthi, who has toured with Federer since 2007, told Reuters in an interview. �He focuses on himself. He has a lot of respect for Rafa and knows what it takes to win that many titles. �I don�t see him in any way stressed. He won�t be completely destroyed if Rafa makes the 20.� Luthi said fans of tennis should savour watching the two greats, rather than obsess about who is superior. �It�s good for the fans. Especially the ones who thought it was all over when Roger had 16 or 17 and Rafa had 14.� Luthi is captain of the Swiss Davis Cup team that has had to make do without Federer and three-times Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka for the past four years. They were both absent again when Switzerland lost to Slovakia in a Group I clash in Bratislava, meaning there is no chance Switzerland could play in the revamped Davis Cup Finals until 2021 at the earliest. Federer�s decision not top play Davis Cup could effect his eligibility for the Tokyo Olympics, although Luthi said no final decision had been made on whether he will play in Tokyo. �It�s possible but it�s not a goal,� Luthi said. �He will leave it open a little bit. I don�t know how it works with (Olympic) wildcards. They used to give them to the small countries, but I think if he said he wanted to play....� Federer and Nadal, whose rivalry has always been respectful, will join forces this week at the Laver Cup in Geneva when Europe take on the Rest of the World.

The Men in Blue are now looking forward to the T20 World Cup in Australia later in 2020 and with a big pool of players to choose from, the captain has drawn the lines. Skipper Virat Kohli has said the new players who would be picked have four to five opportunities to prove their worth.Speaking ahead of his team�s first T20I against South Africa in Dharamsala that got washed out on Sunday, Kohli said the same had applied even for himself when he started. The 30-year-old made his India debut in 2008 and has seen a phenomenal run with over 20k runs scored across three formats with 68 international hundreds.Advertisement�We are very clear. It is not that anyone will get 30 chances. Even when I came in the team, I didn�t think I will get 15-20 games and I knew I will mostly get chances in three to five games and I have to prove myself. One will get suppose five chances and he will have to prove himself. That is the level we are playing at. As the team management has that mindset, the individual should also have the same,� Kohli was heard saying while speaking during an interaction on bcci.tv.The 2007 world champions in T20Is will be playing around 30 T20Is before the T20 World Cup. About the number of games that each player would get, Kohli said the management would figure it out. �It is a delicate balance to strike but as we have 30 games before it (World Cup), so we have to figure out how much time each individual gets,� the ace batsman added.When being asked whether the T20I series against the Proteas marks the beginning of India�s preparation for the T20 World Cup next year, Kohli said along with it, the ongoing ICC World Test Championship is also being kept under consideration.�We feel both the T20Is and the Test championship are in our focus as both of them are milestones and that is why youngsters are being pushed in from time to time as it is important to settle the team combination because we have to figure out the guys who will take the team forward,� Kohli stated.India are currently on top of the points table in the World Test Championship with 120 points picked from the recent two-Test series against the West Indies.

Recently announced by way of YouTube�s Creator Insider channel, where the company shares updates and changes with its creator community, these new profile cards would appear whenever you clicked on a commenter�s name, and would list all their other recent comments on the channel.Currently, if you click on a commenter�s name, you�re redirected to their channel page on YouTube.But that doesn�t allow the video creator or other commenters to learn much about the person behind a given comment, in many cases, as not everyone publishes to YouTube. The commenter�s channel could be sparse, out of date or completely unrelated to the topic at hand.With the new profile cards, however, you�ll instead be able to see all the recent comments left on the channel over the past 12 months. However, it won�t show their comments left on other channels at this time. In other words, it�s not a full user profile, similar to what you would find on other message board sites like Reddit, where a complete comment history is available for each user.�It will help you get a sense of what this person is writing,� explains YouTube Director of Product Management Tom Leung, in the annoucement published in the past week. �We hope that it will strengthen connections with others in the YouTube community and will help creators recognize some of their best commenters,� he added.Though not mentioned, the new feature also could help creators recognize some of their worst commenters, as well � meaning, those who only show up to troll, derail discussions or otherwise cause problems.Being able to see a history of someone�s comments would allow a video creator or moderator to make a more informed decision about whether future comments from the same user should be hidden or, conversely, if the user is trustworthy enough to earn a spot on the �approved users� list so their comments get published automatically.The new profile card also will include a link to the commenter�s YouTube channel, but it doesn�t redirect you there as before. YouTube didn�t say how broadly the experiment is being rolled out for testing�s sake, but it was well-received by the community members reacting to the announcement at the time.The test is one of several experiments running on YouTube at present. Another will allow video creators to display a personalized message to help attract new subscribers, the video also noted.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/youtube-tests-profile-cards-that-show-users-comment-history/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The updates involve changes to live video broadcasting, Facebook�s Watch Party and Creator Studio, and they include enhancements to tools, expanded feature sets and improved analytics, among other things.The highlights include better ways to prep for and simulcast live broadcasts, ways to take better advantage of Watch Party events, new metrics to track video performance and a much-anticipated option to schedule Instagram/IGTV  content for up to six months in advance.Live videoIn terms of live video, Facebook says it listened to feedback from those who have been broadcasting live on its platform, and is now rolling out several highly requested features to Facebook Pages (not Profiles.) The changes are an attempt to better accommodate professional broadcasters who want to use Facebook�s live broadcasting capabilities instead of or in addition to other platforms, like YouTube.Through the Live API, publishers can now use a �rehearsal� feature to broadcast live only to Page admins and editors in order to test new production setups, interactive features and show formats before going live to a full audience. QVC has tested this feature, as they broadcast live on Facebook for hundreds of hours per month, and have wanted to try out new workflows and formats.Publishers will also be able to trim the beginning and end of a live video, and can live broadcast for as long as eight hours � double the previous limit of four hours.This latter capability has already been used by NASA, which broadcast an eight-hour spacewalk, for example, and it also leaves room for broadcasting things like live sports, news events and Twitch-like gaming broadcasts.Most notably, perhaps, is that the company realizes live broadcasters need to serve their audiences outside of Facebook. Now, publishers will be able to use apps that let them stream to more than one streaming service at once, by simulcasting via the Live API.Live video recently rolled out to Facebook Lite, as well, the company also noted.Watch PartyFacebook additionally announced a few new updates for its co-watching feature, Watch Party, which include the ability for Pages to schedule a party in advance to build anticipation, support for �replays� that will let others enjoy the video after airing, the ability to tag business partners in branded content and new analytics.As for the latter, two new metrics are being added to Creator Studio: Minutes Viewed and Unique 60s Viewers (total number of unique users that watched at least 60 seconds in a Watch Party). These complement existing metrics like reach and engagement.The Live Commenting feature, which allows a host to go live in a Watch Party to share their own commentary, is also now globally available.Creator StudioAnd wrapping all this up is an update to Creator Studio, which is what publishers use to post, manage, monetize and measure their content across both Facebook and Instagram.The dashboard will soon add a new visualization layer in Loyalty Insights to help creators see which videos loyal fans want to see by measuring which videos drive return viewers.A new Distribution metric will score each video�s performance based on the Page�s historic average on a range of metrics, including: 1 Minute Views, Average Minutes Watched and Retention. This feature, rolling out in the next few months, will offer an easy-to-read snapshot of a video�s performance.Creator Studio will also now support 13 more languages for auto-captioning: Arabic, Chinese, German, Hindi, Italian, Malay, Russian, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Urdu and Vietnamese. These are in addition to those languages already available, which included English, French, Portuguese and Spanish.Instagram & IGTV scheduling�And finally, publishers and creators will be able to publish and schedule their Instagram Feed and IGTV content for up to six months. In a few more months, Instagram Feed and IGTV drafting and editing will also become available, the company says.This feature was already spotted in the wild before today�s announcement, and it set the social media management and influencer community abuzz. It also follows an update to the Instagram API last year to allow scheduling by third-party applications. However, a native feature is not as limited as some of those other options.The feature is now open to all creators and publishers with Facebook Pages, whereas before some were seeing it labeled only as �coming soon� or were not able to get it working. Story scheduling is not yet included here, but it wouldn�t be surprising to see it added further down the road.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/facebook-rolls-out-new-video-tools-plus-instagram-and-igtv-scheduling-feature/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1212,Evidence indicates Iranian arms used in Saudi attack: Saudis,"The Saudi-led military coalition battling Yemen's Houthi movement said on Monday that the attack on Saudi Arabian oil plants was carried out with Iranian weapons. ""The terrorist attack did not originate from Yemen as the Houthi militia claimed,"" coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Iran had dismissed US accusations that it was responsible for the assault on Saudi oil facilities.",Reuters,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Monday that the attack on its oil facilities was carried out with Iranian weapons, according to a preliminary investigation, but stopped short of directly blaming regional foe Iran. A foreign ministry statement said Riyadh would invite international experts, including from the United Nations, to participate in investigating Saturday�s assault, which cut almost half of Saudi Arabia�s oil production. The United States, which has blamed Iran for the strikes, is studying all available options in addressing the assault, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a phone call on Monday, Saudi state media said.  �Initial investigations show that Iranian weapons were used in the attacks and work is going on to determine the source of those attacks,� the foreign ministry statement said. �The kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks,� it added. Yemen�s Iran-aligned Houthi movement has claimed responsibility for the strikes, but the spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition battling the group said preliminary findings indicated the attack was not launched from Yemen. Tehran has dismissed the U.S. accusations as �unacceptable� and said it was ready for a �full-fledged war.� Riyadh called on the world to condemn those behind the attack on the world�s top oil exporter, a key regional U.S. ally which has supported U.S. President Donald Trump�s �maximum-pressure� campaign on Shi�ite Muslim Iran. Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia�s de facto ruler, told Esper that Iranian threats �are not only directed to the kingdom, but affect the Middle East and the world,� news agency SPA said. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who also called the crown prince on Monday, offered his country�s �full support and capabilities� to the Gulf Arab state, it added.  The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials had said intelligence indicated Iran was the �staging ground� for the attack and had shared the information with Riyadh. It quoted people familiar with the discussions. Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told reporters in Riyadh earlier on Monday that authorities were still determining the launch location. �The terrorist attack did not originate from Yemen as the Houthi militia claimed,� he said, adding that authorities would reveal the location from where drones were launched at a future news conference. The Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim countries intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognized government from power in the capital Sanaa, to prevent Iran from gaining influence through the group. The movement, which denies being a puppet of Tehran and says it is fighting a corrupt system, recently stepped up drone and missile attacks on Saudi cities. The conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

1215,Spot boy would've been paid more: 'Rang De...' writer on taking less pay,"'Rang De Basanti' writer Kamlesh Pandey has said he was so driven to make the Aamir Khan-starrer that he took on the job for ""very less"" remuneration. ""The money I got, the spot boy would've got paid more,"" he added. ""I don't feel sad about that though...It was my decision because I could afford to...work for less money,"" said Kamlesh.",Times Now,"Rang De Basanti writer Kamlesh Pandey on Sunday said he was so driven to make the Aamir Khan-starrer that he took on the job for ""very less"" remuneration.In his career of over 30 years, Pandey has penned blockbusters and acclaimed films like Saudagar, Tezaab and Delhi 6.At a session organised by the Screenwriters Association (SWA), Pandey said today there is a new plan which ensures fair pay to writers.""Actors set their own fees, so a writer should also set his/her fees according to how hard one has worked. For example, I took about a year to write Rang De Basanti and it took six years for it to be a final film. The money I got, the spot boy would've got paid more,"" Pandey said.""I don't feel sad about that though. I agreed because I wanted to make this film at any cost. It was my decision because I could afford to do that. That I could work for less money,"" he added.The writer said money was not a factor for him in his initial days as he was cushioned by an advertising job.""I moonlighted as an advertising professional and a film-TV writer. I kept the safety net of advertising for a long time, till 1992, and then left it.""Whether a job or something else, you have to have something for yourself. It wouldn't work if you only depend on writing. If you are a new writer in this expensive city, it's difficult to survive purely on writing.""Pandey further noted a writer must always keep in mind the time his story is set in and update it accordingly.Citing an example from Rang De Basanti, the scribe said when he was penning the Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra-directed movie, six films on Bhagat Singh had already flopped.""I was turned down from everywhere because people called it 'another film on Bhagat Singh after six flops'. I told them it's about young India. Bhagat Singh is a device. 'What he would do if he was here today, what are the children of today doing?'
""But people didn't get the script. In fact, we had gone with the film to a big superstar's son. But his mother said My son won't die!"" he said.Asked if a writer should always hold their ground when there is a suggestion from the producer or actor to tweak the script, Pandey said they should roll with it as long as it helps the story.""The climax of Rang De Basanti was set in the Lok Sabha where the men go and carry a shootout. We debated a month over this that it would never get censor (certificate). You can't use Lok Sabha for this. Aamir said he had an idea.""For some other film of his, he had kept a situation that the men enter a radio station and give their statement from there. It worked and I said 'It's fantastic, let's do this'. So it isn't that you don't listen to anyone. Whatever works for the benefit of the story, do it,"" he added.",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/spot-boy-wouldve-got-paid-more-rang-de-basanti-writer-kamlesh-on-getting-paid-less-for-aamir-khan-starrer/489581?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

On Sunday night, Dheena Senthil, a 14-year-old boy was electrocuted to death after coming in contact with an exposed live wire on the street.The incident happened at around 10 pm in Dhanam Nagar, near the old post office in Chennai�s Mugalivakkam neighbourhood.Dheena, a resident of the neighbourhood, was�walking on the street when he stepped on the electricity board wire which had not been isolated and buried properly by Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) personnel.Although a few people saw Dheena get electrocuted, they could not rescue him as he died instantly.According to reports, the road had been dug up by the electricity board to lay wires for street lights and drainage pipes in the locality. However,�the works had not been completed and the workers had temporarily covered the wires with mud, instead of isolating and burying them properly.With rains over the last few days, the mud on top was dislodged, exposing the live wire underneath killing Dheena when he came in contact with it.Following the boy�s death, several people pointed out the negligence by the Chennai Corporation and the TNEB personnel which led to the tragic incident.Local channels reported that aggrieved residents staged a protest and halted traffic following the boy�s death on Sunday night and that tensions dissolved only after police officers arrived and promised to take action against the erring TNEB officials.However, officers of the T4 Mangadu police station who are charged with investigating the case deny that protests had occurred in the neighbourhood.�A few people had witnessed the boy�s death and had been standing there. However, there were no agitations or protests when we reached there,� an officer from the police station told TNM.Dheena was a class 9 student of the government higher secondary school in KK Nagar.

1226,Hyderabad college that asked girls to wear long kurtis withdraws dress code,Hyderabad's St Francis College for Women which made it mandatory for girls to wear long kurtis has withdrawn the dress code. This comes after students protested against the dress code and had alleged moral policing by the college authorities since August. A student earlier claimed that college authorities told them that a long kurti would get them good marriage proposals.,The News Minute,"In a big win for the students of Hyderabad�s St Francis Women�s College, the management on Monday finally lifted the diktat to wear knee-length kurtis to the college. The students of the college had been protesting against the controversial dress code and had alleged moral policing by the college authorities since August.On Monday morning, the students had blocked the entrance to the college in order to strike a dialogue with the college management.Speaking to TNM, a student at the college campus said the dress-code has been lifted and the same was informed to the student representatives who were in discussions with the St. Francis management. ""We are now allowed to dress as per the undertaking which allows us to wear clothes except mini-skirts and crop tops,"" the student added.The dress code, which was brought into force from August 1, made it mandatory for the students to wear knee-length kurtis. The students were not happy with the decision as it was not easy for a section of students to change their wardrobe in between a semester and also many could not afford the college's new decision. They also said the new dress code didn�t aim at bringing uniformity among students but was a result of regressive patriarchal mind-set.The students claimed that their attempts to hold a discussion with the management were futile as they were again moral-policed and told that their parents sent them to college in order to �get good marriage proposals� in the future.The situation worsened on Friday when the college appointed female security guards who heckled the students and prevented them from attending classes for wearing kurtis that were slightly above the knee. A video of the college principal, Sr Sandra Horta, also emerged, where she was seen checking the dress of the students.A student had then told TNM, �We don't want to be a part of an institution that wants to institutionalise this kind of patriarchy. Speaking to us in such a tone, giving us subliminal messages that we are arousing males, I don't think is a very appropriate environment or a good environment for all of us to be in. I don't think it helps our intellectual development either.�Despite repeated attempts, the school principal did not respond to the calls or messages from TNM on the issue.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/big-win-students-hyd-s-st-francis-college-withdraws-controversial-dress-code-108970?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It�s been phenomenal cricket. That World Cup was incredible. What a summer of cricket it�s been. We have a great opportunity now to spring the game forward in this country.�Root�s ambitions will rest heavily on the continued success of Jofra Archer, who bowled a blistering spell to Australian centurion Matthew Wade on Sunday.�Jofra�s come in and been fantastic: four Tests, two six-fors,� said Root. �He has a way of having a huge impact on the game.

The court said that the investigating officer had stated information based on other cases (probes into murders of Narendra Dabholkar and Gauri Lankesh).

Whatever you (SIT) have stated here is all resting on the probe in other cases (the probe into killings of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and journalist Gauri Lankesh),� the bench said.�We must convey our unhappiness. Things are not moving. We are refraining from passing critical order against the officer only in light of prevailing conditions of continuous rains in the area. But we hope the SIT will submit a better and comprehensive report next time,� the bench added.The court said the only reason it was refraining from passing a more critical order was that it realised the officer concerned had failed to make any significant progress in the past few weeks due to floods in Kolhapur.Earlier, during the hearing, the CBI, which is investigating the Dabholkar case, also submitted a progress report on its probe.While Dabholkar was shot dead on August 20, 2013 in Pune, Pansare was shot at on February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur and succumbed to his injuries a few days later on February 20.

Kamlesh said writers should incorporate suggestions from actors and producers as long as it helps the story.",Times Now,"Rang De Basanti writer Kamlesh Pandey on Sunday said he was so driven to make the Aamir Khan-starrer that he took on the job for ""very less"" remuneration.In his career of over 30 years, Pandey has penned blockbusters and acclaimed films like Saudagar, Tezaab and Delhi 6.At a session organised by the Screenwriters Association (SWA), Pandey said today there is a new plan which ensures fair pay to writers.""Actors set their own fees, so a writer should also set his/her fees according to how hard one has worked. For example, I took about a year to write Rang De Basanti and it took six years for it to be a final film. The money I got, the spot boy would've got paid more,"" Pandey said.""I don't feel sad about that though. I agreed because I wanted to make this film at any cost. It was my decision because I could afford to do that. That I could work for less money,"" he added.The writer said money was not a factor for him in his initial days as he was cushioned by an advertising job.""I moonlighted as an advertising professional and a film-TV writer. I kept the safety net of advertising for a long time, till 1992, and then left it.""Whether a job or something else, you have to have something for yourself. It wouldn't work if you only depend on writing. If you are a new writer in this expensive city, it's difficult to survive purely on writing.""Pandey further noted a writer must always keep in mind the time his story is set in and update it accordingly.Citing an example from Rang De Basanti, the scribe said when he was penning the Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra-directed movie, six films on Bhagat Singh had already flopped.""I was turned down from everywhere because people called it 'another film on Bhagat Singh after six flops'. I told them it's about young India. Bhagat Singh is a device. 'What he would do if he was here today, what are the children of today doing?'
""But people didn't get the script. In fact, we had gone with the film to a big superstar's son. But his mother said My son won't die!"" he said.Asked if a writer should always hold their ground when there is a suggestion from the producer or actor to tweak the script, Pandey said they should roll with it as long as it helps the story.""The climax of Rang De Basanti was set in the Lok Sabha where the men go and carry a shootout. We debated a month over this that it would never get censor (certificate). You can't use Lok Sabha for this. Aamir said he had an idea.""For some other film of his, he had kept a situation that the men enter a radio station and give their statement from there. It worked and I said 'It's fantastic, let's do this'. So it isn't that you don't listen to anyone.

1245,Pant will be rapped on the knuckles if he repeats mistakes: Shastri,"Team India head coach Ravi Shastri has said that 21-year-old wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant will be rapped on the knuckles if he repeats his mistakes. ""No one will change his style but match awareness and shot selection become crucial in particular situations,"" Shastri added. ""It's time for him to...just show the world how devastating he is,"" he further said.",CricTracker,"There is little denying the fact that Rishabh Pant is set to get an extended run in the Indian team across formats. The highly-rated youngster is being widely seen as MS Dhoni�s apt replacement. Thus the team-management is unlikely to drop Pant anytime soon. However, India head coach Ravi Shastri has sent a timely reminder to the youngster about his place in the team.Shastri has made it clear that Pant cannot take his position in the side for granted, saying that the youngster will be �rapped on the knuckles� if he keeps on playing rash shots. Pant received widespread criticism for his performance in West Indies. It was the first time, he was picked in the ODI and the T20I side as the number one wicketkeeper-batsman. A good outing in the Caribbean Islands would have pretty much sealed Pant�s place in the team.AdvertisementHowever, the Delhi star failed to grab the opportunity and performed miserably. Barring the fifty in the third T20I, he did not make much of an impact. What made things worse for him was his poor shots. Pant showed little application and was out playing rash shots more often than not. But Shastri has now sent a timely reminder to Pant, asking the batsman to bat smartly.�We�ll let him be but at times when you see a shot, like the first ball dismissal in Trinidad, if he repeats that, then he will be told. There will be a rap on the knuckles, talent or no talent,� Shastri told�Star Sports.�As simple as that. Because you are letting the team down, forget letting yourselves down. In a situation where you have the captain at the other end, a target to chase, the need of the hour is sensible cricket,� he added.While Rishabh Pant�s aggressive batting style has often attracted debate, Shastri said that changing the style is never an option. The coach said that the batsmen need to read the game well in order to succeed. He also asked Pant to step up and start delivering.�No one will even think of changing his style. Like Virat said, reading the situation, match-awareness and shot-selection becomes crucial. If he can fathom that, he could be unstoppable. It could take one game, it could take four games. He has played so much IPL cricket, he will learn. It�s time now for him to step up and show how devastating he can be,� Shastri said with captain Virat Kohli by his side.",https://www.crictracker.com/india-head-coach-ravi-shastri-fires-warning-to-rishabh-pant/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""We're trying to get to stage where the toss isn't that important to us. You've got to win games of cricket when you lose a toss,"" he added.",The Quint,"England beat Australia by 135 runs in the fifth and final Ashes Test at the Oval on Sunday, 15 September, to draw the series 2-2.It's the first time an Ashes series has ended in a draw since 1972.Australia had already retained the urn as holder but was thwarted in its goal of a first outright series win in England in 18 years after being dismissed for 263 in its second innings deep into the evening session on Day 4.Both teams had something to celebrate as Australia was later presented with the series trophy and the Ashes urn.""We were excellent this week. Having lost the toss, to play as we did was fantastic. We drove the game all the time and got there in the end,"" England captain Joe Root said.Steve Smith proved a formidable presence at No. 4 for Australia throughout the series but was caught by Ben Stokes at leg gully off pacer Stuart Broad for 23, by far his lowest score of the series.Smith finished with 774 runs in the series in seven innings at an average of 110. The star batter received a standing ovation from England and Australia fans as he left the field on Sunday, a strong sign Smith has been forgiven after a ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal.Matthew Wade was Australia's top scorer with 117 after beginning to worry England as the visitors chased an unlikely winning target of 399. Wade was stumped off a delivery from Root.Broad took 4-62 and spinner Jack Leach 4-49 for England.Earlier, England resumed its second innings on 313-8 and was all out for 329.""England got ahead of the game. I can't read a pitch so I'm always 50-50.

1248,You never write off champion players: Justin Langer on David Warner,"Talking about David Warner, who scored 95 runs in 2019 Ashes, Australia head coach Justin Langer said, ""It doesnt matter what sport...you never write off champion players. They tend to come good, don't they?"" ""Theres plenty of upside still to his batting,"" Langer added. Notably, England fast bowler Stuart Broad dismissed Warner 7 out of 10 times in the series.",Cricket Country,"One batsman who will want to quickly forget the Ashes 2019 series is David Warner, who�s horrific show with the bat ended with a dreadful average of just 9.50.Stuart Broad terrorised Warner with his around-the-wicket line and removed the southpaw for the seventh time across his 10 innings that set a new Test record.Such an instance has occurred on only five other occasions when a bowler dismissed a player seven times in a single series. The last time this happened was in the previous Ashes series where Australia spin bowler Nathan Lyon haunted Moeen Ali.READ: David Warner�s horror Ashes series ends as Stuart Broad gets him out for record-equalling 7th timeDespite his form, Warner found vital support from head coach Justin Langer. �I think, talking frankly, he let Stuart Broad get into his head and he thought way too much about it,� Langer said.After his 61-run knock in the first innings of the third Test at Headingley, the 11 runs he scored in his final innings at Manchester on Sunday was Warner�s second highest score in the series. He also has 3 consecutive ducks in the series.�I�ve seen it before, even with the great players, every now and then they have a series � and I�m talking about the all-time great players � they have a series where�I remember Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) with Andrew Flintoff, I remember seeing Steve Waugh sit on the team bus in South Africa and the guy had been a run machine for so long, he got out just before stumps and I, in a sick sort of way, thought it was the best thing I�d ever seen,� Langer said.ALSO READ: Steve Smith, Pat Cummins remain on top in Test Rankings�In this instance I don�t think David solved the puzzle, and he�ll be first to admit that, he�ll probably be very relieved he gets on the Qantas flight in a day�s time and doesn�t have to face Stuart Broad for a while I reckon. But he is certainly, there�s plenty of upside still to his batting. I�ve learned over a long period you never write off champion players, it doesn�t matter what sport, you never write off champion players. They tend to come good, don�t they? So, he�s had a tough series, no doubt about that, but he�s also a champion player so usually with champion players they get a bit more time to come good.�Meanwhile, Langer believes that although there has been great improvement in the Australian team over his 16 months in charge, there should be more for the side to reach greatness.�It�s something we�re getting better at, how we back up after a win.�That probably comes with the maturity of the group as well. It�s ok to fight back when you are underdogs and it�s one of those Australian things � we love the underdog tag. To fight back from a tough loss is admirable and I said how proud I was with everyone for that.ALSO READ: Steve Smith in a class of his own and other talking points�But also over the last couple of years we haven�t necessarily performed at our best after a win. Really good teams do that. We didn�t do that too well after the first Test at Lord�s. We didn�t do it after this Test. There have been some Test series over the last couple of years where the team hasn�t been able to. I think that�ll be part of the maturity of our side. If you probably think about it, the way we were in this series, we aren�t a great team yet.�We are a good team, we are a maturing team. We have got some great players in it. But we�re aspiring to be a great cricket team. You got to work hard and get consistent results to achieve that. That comes from experience and learning how to win. That comes with players individually getting more experienced and the team working together.

The Ministry may first place the draft guidelines for obtaining comments from the public before forwarding them to the states.The crux of this policy will be that the venture must be run on a �no-profit-no-loss� basis. The broad objective is to share the cost of using the vehicles between the users so that no one is at a loss and at the same time, there will be lesser number of cars on the roads bringing the pollution and traffic levels down a notch.Some of the other suggestions include the stipulation that the car-pooling service must be offered through an app. Whoever is administering the app will have to be made responsible for a proper KYC of the car owner as well as the riders before they are allowed to be part of the ecosystem.The states can add a small fee to be paid to it out of the carpooling service operations, if wanted.The new guidelines will also ensure that the states get some revenue from carpooling. This suggestion is aimed at making the state government have a vested interest in running this facility and encouraging it. There are apps already in operation, like Quick Ride and BlaBlaCar. These will have to make suitable changes to their applications once the guidelines are approved and become law in the respective states.If the app-based hail-a-cab operators like Ola and Uber wish to enter the carpooling business, they will have to create a separate platform and not include it in their existing arrangement as per these guidelines. �This policy framework is part of the larger National Mission for Transformative Mobility announced by the government earlier.��",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/govt-drafting-norms-ride-sharing-mandatory-kyc-users-limit-4-rides-day-108985?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1251,"5,000 delivery execs log out from Zomato over revised payments: Report","Around 2,000-3,000 delivery executives in Mumbai and another 3,000 in Bengaluru have logged out of food delivery app Zomato and are protesting since Saturday, The News Minute reported. They claimed Zomato reduced their per delivery earning and increased the number of orders that guarantee an incentive. Delivery executives in Bengaluru have also written to Zomato opposing the new incentive scheme.",The News Minute,"Even as many restaurants stay logged out of Zomato, trouble has spilled to its delivery business as thousands of delivery executives in Bengaluru and Mumbai are protesting against the food aggregator over revised rate cards. Around 3000 delivery executives in Mumbai and another 3000 in Bengaluru have logged out of the app and have been protesting since Saturday.The bone of contention is the change in their payment systems. Delivery executives are given rate cards which define how much they will be paid per delivery and lays out incentives based on orders completed and kilometres travelled.Delivery executives claim that Zomato has reduced their per delivery earning, increased the number of orders that will earn them an incentive and has also increased the kilometres they need to travel to get additional bonus.In Bengaluru, delivery executives earlier earned Rs 40 per delivery, which has now been reduced to Rs 30. In terms of incentives, the executives were earlier paid Rs 550 as incentive for 15 deliveries on weekends. This has been changed to Rs 500 for 18 deliveries. Zomato has also allegedly increased the distance required (from 4 kms to 5.5 kms) to make workers eligible to receive �bonus points�.Zomato delivery executives protesting in HSR Layout, BengaluruWasim a native of Kolkata, who joined Zomato a year ago was earning Rs 34,000 -- minus fuel cost of Rs 6000 � after working for 15-16 hours a day. ""Now for the last three days, I have logged out. My wife is pregnant, my costs will further go up. It will be impossible to make a living. I have a small loan to service also. Earlier we had bonuses for every order in excess of 5km. Now this is no longer there. It is very hard to compete 20 orders in a day with the new target of 24 orders, it is impossible to get the incentive which is the most important part,� he says.The situation is similar in Mumbai. Delivery executives, who earlier got paid Rs 35 per delivery, will now be paid only Rs 25. And while they used to get Rs 240 as an incentive on completing 11 orders, this has now changed to 14 orders.Rakesh, a delivery executive in Mumbai says that they were promised earnings of up to Rs 20,000 for part time and Rs 40,000 for full time. �We now work for 12 hours and still barely earn Rs 20,000. Of that we need to spend for petrol and mobile recharge. Petrol prices are increasing. In any company, salary increases as time goes. So on what basis is Zomato reducing our earnings?� he asks.Zomato delivery executives protesting in MumbaiPrakash*, a college student who funds himself and his family says that his monthly earning will be affected by nearly Rs 5000 with the new rates.""On Thursday, I had logged in for the whole day and I made Rs 1400 on the app. Now imagine if I had to spend almost the whole day and logged out at 11 pm to make that. In the current situation, I have to deliver more orders, which would mean an additional three hours on the app to make the same amount. Do you think this is possible? If I do the same work as now, I would only make Rs 1200,� he says.Delivery executives also claim that the number of orders they have been receiving has significantly come down. And this is mainly because of the number of delivery executives Zomato has onboarded. This would mean that it takes longer for an executive to receive an order and takes even longer to complete the required number of orders to receive an incentive.Zomato delivery executives protesting in Worli, MumbaiSivanandan, another delivery executive from Mumbai claims that the company does not even help them when they meet with accidents and get injured. �Zomato says they are running under loss. But the real loss is for us � we pay for petrol, for mobile bills and even medical bills when we meet with an accident,� he adds.Several delivery executives in Bengaluru too, shared instances of them meeting with an accident resulting in severe injuries and Zomato taking no responsibility for the same.Delivery executives in Bengaluru have now written to Zomato opposing the new incentive scheme and that order distance also be reduced so that it doesn�t take them too long to deliver. They will be meeting with the company later today.Shaheed from Mumbai, however, claims that Zomato is not paying heed to their demands. Some executives were called for a meeting, but there hasn�t been any resolution.�We have given Zomato so much of our time. Our main demand is that the old rate system and incentive system be restored,� Shaheed adds.While Zomato did not specifically respond to TNM�s questions on how the new scheme will work, a company spokesperson said, �Different metrics such as base pay, user satisfaction, delivery touchpoints, minimum guarantee etc. help us appreciate our delivery partners in accordance with their efforts. Reduced average delivery time (less than 30 mins) and increased system efficiency have enabled our delivery partners to perform more deliveries in the same amount of time.��We regret the inconvenience caused to our users and are continuously working to resume our services in the affected areas,� it added.Also read:�Why 1,200+ restaurants are choosing to log off food apps like Zomato and Dineout",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/scores-zomato-delivery-executives-logout-protest-against-reduction-incentives-108998?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This is the second time in just weeks that Shiv Sena chief has expressed confidence that Ram Temple would be built under Prime Minister Modi.Earlier this month, Uddhav Thackeray shared the dais with the Prime Minister at an event organised to mark the laying of the foundation stone for three metro lines in Mumbai. Addressing the gathering there, he had made a similar remark and said: �I am assuring you in the presence of Prime Minister that Ram Mandir will be built under his leadership in Ayodhya.� Shiv Sena chief further said that all those things which he had been promising to implement for so many years have now been fulfilled by PM Modi.�I am proud that Article 370 has been abrogated. This promise has been fulfilled. I am sure that we will build the Ram temple in Ayodhya,� Thackeray said. The confidence of BJP supporters has shot up after Prime Minister Modi abrogated special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370. This was one of the key promises that BJP and Shiv Sena had been making for decades.While the BJP was expected to act on Article 370 � it figured prominently in its election manifesto for Lok Sabha elections � that the government would remove this so soon was not anticipated. With the abolition of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and triple talaq, Modi dared to go where no politician could in the past, considering the possible political repercussions. These bold moves of Modi have sent a signal that his government can deliver on its promises. Ayodhya dispute is currently before the Supreme Court which is hearing the matter on a daily basis.Prime Minister Modi has maintained on several occasions that the matter is before the Supreme Court and his government would wait for the court to arrive at a conclusion.�Thackeray�s increased mentions of the Ram Temple comes just ahead of the Assembly polls in the state scheduled for later this year.

Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected a meeting and any talks with Washington while Iran is subject to sanctions, which Trump re-imposed after withdrawing last year from Tehran�s 2015 nuclear accords with world powers. Iran earlier condemned as �unacceptable� U.S. accusations it was behind an attack on Saudi oil plants, after the United States said it was �locked and loaded� for a potential response. The strikes were claimed by Yemen�s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. �Stopping all sanctions is an indispensable precondition for constructive diplomacy. We hold meetings when we are sure that our people�s problems can be solved,� government spokesman Ali Rabiei said, according to the semi-official news agency Tasnim.  �Sanctions must be lifted, and the United States must respect the Iranian nation,� Rabiei said. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Sunday the previous day�s attacks �did not help� prospects for a meeting between the two leaders during the United Nations General Assembly this month, but she left open the possibility a meeting could take place.

After making a promising big-screen debut with Yash Raj Films� Shuddh Desi Romance in 2013, the actress had to wait for three long years for her second Hindi release, Aditya Chopra�s Befikre (2016). The romantic comedy, co-starring Ranveer Singh, tanked at the box office, turning out to be a huge setback for Vaani.

1285,MIT researchers create ML-driven tool to predict cardiovascular death,"Researchers at MIT have developed a machine learning system, 'RiskCardio', to better predict death caused by cardiovascular issues that block or reduce blood flow. The system uses the patient's first 15 minutes of raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and places them into different risk categories. It can predict whether a person will die within 30 days or up to a year.",Engadget,"AI's ability to predict threats to your health could soon include deadly heart conditions.  Researchers at MIT's CSAIL have developed a machine learning system, RiskCardio, that can estimate the risk of death due to cardiovascular issues that block or reduce blood flow.  All it needs is a 15-minute ECG reading -- from there, it gauges the danger based on the sets of consecutive beats in the sample. If the data is captured within 15 minutes of an event, RiskCardio can determine whether or not someone will die within 30 days, or even up to a year later.The approach is based on the notion that greater variability between heartbeats reflects greater risk.  Scientists trained the machine learning system using historical data for patient outcomes.  If a patient survived, their heartbeats were deemed relatively normal; if a patient died, their heart activity was considered risky.  The ultimate risk score comes by averaging the prediction from each set of consecutive heartbeats.There's plenty of work to be done, including refining the training data to account for more ages, ethnic backgrounds and genders.  It clearly needs to be accurate when mistakes could have dangerous consequences.  If RiskCardio does enter service, though, it could prove vital to health care.  Doctors could quickly assess a patient's health and decide on an appropriate level of treatment.  CSAIL also hopes it can help understand less-than-clear scenarios by running poorly-labeled data  through the system.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/15/mit-machine-learning-cardiovascular-death-risk/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1303,Kim Jong-un invited Trump to North Korea in letter: Report,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un invited US President Donald Trump to visit the country in a letter sent in August amid stalled denuclearisation talks, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday, citing diplomatic sources. Kim spoke of his ""willingness"" for a third summit in the letter, which was reportedly sent in the third week of August.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declined to comment on a newspaper report that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had invited him to visit Pyongyang and said conditions were not ready yet for such a visit. �The relationship is very good but I don�t want to comment on that,� Trump told reporters at the White House when asked whether Kim had invited him to North Korea. A South Korean newspaper on Monday cited diplomatic sources as saying Kim had invited him to visit the North Korean capital in a letter sent in August amid stalled denuclearization talks. Trump said he would �probably not� be inclined to visit North Korea in the short term, but did not rule out an eventual visit. �I would do it ... at some time in a later future, and depending on what happens I�m sure he�ll love coming to the United States also. But, no, I don�t think it�s ready for that. I think we have a ways to go yet,� Trump said. Kim, in the letter sent in the third week of August, spoke of his �willingness� for a third summit and extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pyongyang, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source. Trump on Aug. 9 said he had received a �very beautiful letter� from Kim. But U.S. officials have not said anything about a second letter in August. Trump and Kim have met three times since June last year to discuss ways to resolve a crisis over North Korea�s missile and nuclear programs, but substantive progress has been scant.  Their first two meetings were formal summits, the second of which, in Vietnam in February, broke down after they failed to narrow a gap between U.S. demands for North Korean denuclearization and a North Korean demand for relief from sanctions. They met for a third time on June 30 in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas and agreed to restart working-level talks but that has not happened. Since the June meeting, North Korea has several times tested short-range missiles. The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. An unidentified director-general for U.S. affairs at North Korea�s foreign ministry said on Monday he hoped a �good meeting� with working-level U.S. officials would take place �in a few weeks�. But whether a meeting would lead to a �crisis or chance� was up to the United States, the official said, calling for a more flexible approach.  �The discussion of denuclearization may be possible when threats and hurdles endangering our system security and obstructing our development are clearly removed beyond all doubt,� the official said in a statement carried by North Korea�s official KCNA news agency. A spokeswoman for the State Department said the United States welcomed the North Korean commitment to resume negotiations in late September, but it had no meetings to announce. �We are prepared to have those discussions at a time and place to be agreed,� she said. The spokeswoman did not respond when asked if the United States was willing to offer any easing of sanctions or security guarantees.  South Korea�s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, asked about the newspaper report, said there were �detailed explanations about such a letter� but declined to elaborate.  Kang said it could be �too much to expect� that Trump and Kim would meet before any working-level talks.  �No agreement was reached between the two leaders in Hanoi even after working-level negotiations,� Kang told a parliamentary panel.  �For the sake of the success of another summit, their working-level teams should meet and have primary discussions on the outcome of the summit,� Kang said.

1322,"Quinton de Kock reminds me of Brian Lara, Kumar Sangakkara: Gambhir","Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir has said that South Africa wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock reminds him of Kumar Sangakkara and Brian Lara. ""He is one of those gorgeous left-handers which I always aspired to be but could never be. Hopefully, he delivers as a captain but not at the cost of curtailing fluidity of his batting, Gambhir added.",Cricket Country,"The grace and flamboyance with which Quinton de Kock bats reminds Gautam Gambhir of the great Brian Lara and Sangakkara, the former India opener wrote in his column for the Times of India Saturday. Gambhir, who retired from international cricket last December, admitted de Kock�s style is the type which he wouldn�t have mind implementing in his own game during his playing days.ALSO READ: Five South Africa players to watch out forAs de Kock gets ready to lead South Africa for the first time in T20Is, a lot rides on how he goes about in this series. With Faf du Plessis rested, De Kock is most likely candidate to take over the reins, one who is expected to take the lead the team to Australia next year for the T20 World Cup.Team Director Enoch Nkwe recently said that it�s about time South Africa look beyond du Plessis. The key is to blood youngsters going into the T20 World Cup and as de Kock gears up to lead a fairly young side in India following their World Cup debacle, his stiff test starts right away. South Africa are hurting and de Kock would be keen eager to making his IPL experience count against one of the toughest teams to beat on their home turf.�In the context of South Africa�s tour of India, the visitors may relate to this as this is their first international engagement after a forgetful World Cup campaign. I like Quinton de Kock. He is one of those gorgeous left-handers which I always aspired to be but could never be. In full flow, he reminds me of Kumara Sangakkara and Brian Lara. Hopefully, he delivers as a captain but not at the cost of curtailing fluidity of his batting,� Gambhir said.The former India opener feels India would fancy playing against a relatively low-on-experience side on their home turf. India are yet to win an T20I against South Africa at home, their last meeting ending in the Proteas beating them 2-0 in 2015. The three-match series opener will take place on Sunday in Dharamsala, where South Africa beat India the last time after they chased down 200.Gambhir however believes that time with the likes of promising youngsters such as Manish Pandey and Shreyas Iyer in the side, India are better equipped and that the series also gives the opportunity to these young talents an opportunity to cement their place in the team, keeping an eye of the T20 World Cup in Australia next year.�India will be licking their lips at the idea of taking on a young, work-in-progress opposition. Dharamsala is not a very big arena. And being at the higher altitude, the science guys tell me that the ball travels faster because the air is thin. All this means there will be plenty of boundaries if the pitch is good for batting,� Gambhir reckoned.�It is another opportunity for young Indian batsmen to cement their place in the side. Manish Pandey looks much younger than his age of 29. Shreyas Iyer explained enough in the West Indies that he is a great deal more than the �South Bombay� swag. KL Rahul is a force in white-ball format. Rishabh Pant is always exciting but he has to watch his back as my favourite Sanju Samson is throwing some serious challenges at him. It is an exciting series as there are a lot of individual battles going on considering the T20 World Cup next year.�",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/india-vs-south-africa-quinton-de-kocks-batting-possesses-shades-of-brian-lara-kumar-sangakkara-gautam-gambhir-891108?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1326,US 'locked & loaded' for potential response to Saudi attacks: Trump,"US President Donald Trump has said the country is ""locked and loaded"" for a potential response to the drone attacks on two Saudi Arabia oil facilities. This comes after State Secretary Mike Pompeo said that Iran was behind the attacks. ""We are waiting to hear from Saudi as to who they believe was the cause of these attacks,"" Trump added.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States was �locked and loaded� for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia�s oil facilities, after a senior U.S. administration official said Iran was to blame. Trump also authorized the use of the U.S. emergency oil stockpile to ensure stable supplies after the attack, which shut 5% of world production and sent crude prices soaring more than 19% in early trade on Monday, before moderating to show a 10% gain. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!� Trump said on Twitter. Earlier in the day, a senior U.S. official told reporters that evidence from the attack, which hit the world�s biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it, instead of the Yemeni Houthi group that had claimed responsibility. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi�ite Muslim rival Iran. �Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world�s energy supply,� Pompeo said. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the U.S. allegations that it was responsible was �pointless�. A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned the Islamic Republic was ready for �full-fledged� war. �All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometres around Iran are within the range of our missiles,� the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying. Tensions between Washington and Tehran were already running high because of a long-running dispute between the two nations over Iran�s nuclear program that led the United States to impose sweeping sanctions. Oil prices surged as much as 19% in early Asian trade on Monday on worries over global supply and soaring tensions in the Middle East.  Brent crude posted its biggest intra-day percentage gain since the start of the Gulf War in 1991. State oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack on Saturday had cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day. The U.S. official, who asked not to be named, said on Sunday there were 19 points of impact in the attack on Saudi facilities and evidence showed the launch area was west-northwest of the targets - not south from Yemen. The official added that Saudi officials indicated they had seen signs that cruise missiles were used in the attack, which is inconsistent with the Iran-aligned Houthi group�s claim that it conducted the attack with 10 drones. �There�s no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there�s no escaping it. There�s no other candidate,� the official told reporters.      Riyadh has accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil-pumping stations and the Shaybah oil field, charges that Tehran denies, but has not blamed anyone for Saturday�s strike. Riyadh also says Tehran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny. Richard Nephew, a program director at Columbia University�s Center on Global Energy Policy, said if Iran was responsible for the attack, it may be as retribution for U.S. sanctions. �They are making decisions about whether and how to respond to what they see as a massive attack on their interests from the U.S. via sanctions by attacking U.S. interests in turn, and those of U.S. partners they believe are responsible for U.S. policy,� he said. Aramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take �weeks, not days�. Riyadh said it would compensate for the damage at its facilities by drawing on its stocks, which stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data.  Trump said he had �authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.�     Consultancy Rapidan Energy Group said images of the Abqaiq facility after the attack showed about five of its stabilization towers appeared to have been destroyed, and would take months to rebuild - something that could curtail output for a prolonged period. �However Saudi Aramco keeps some redundancy in the system to maintain production during maintenance,� Rapidan added, meaning operations could return to pre-attack levels sooner.  The Saudi bourse closed down 1.1% on Sunday, with banking and petrochemical shares taking the biggest hit. Saudi petrochemical firms announced a significant reduction in feedstock supplies. �Abqaiq is the nerve center of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24 to 48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,� Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters. Some Iraqi media outlets said the attack came from there. Baghdad denied that on Sunday and vowed to punish anyone using Iraq, where Iran-backed paramilitary groups wield increasing power, as a launchpad for attacks. Kuwait, which borders Iraq, said it was investigating the sighting of a drone over its territory and coordinating with Saudi Arabia and other countries. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Saturday�s attacks and called on all parties to exercise restraint and prevent any escalation. The European Union warned the strikes posed a real threat to regional security, and several nations urged restraint. The attack came after Trump said a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was possible at the U.N. General Assembly in New York this month. Tehran ruled out talks until sanctions are lifted. But Trump appeared on Sunday to play down the chances he might be willing to meet with Iranian officials, saying reports he would do so without conditions were not accurate. As recently as last Tuesday, Pompeo said Trump �is prepared to meet with no preconditions�. Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Trump that Riyadh was ready to deal with �terrorist aggression�. A Saudi-led coalition has responded to past Houthi attacks with air strikes on the group�s military sites in Yemen. The conflict has been in military stalemate for years. The Saudi alliance has air supremacy but has come under scrutiny over civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis that has left millions facing starvation.

1370,"UK PM likens himself to Incredible Hulk, vows Oct 31 Brexit","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to the comic book character The Incredible Hulk and stressed his determination to take Britain out of the European Union on October 31. ""The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,"" he said. ""Hulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound... and that is the case for this country,"" Johnson added.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to the comic book character The Incredible Hulk in a newspaper interview where he stressed his determination to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31. The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported that Johnson said he would find a way to circumvent a recent parliament vote ordering him to delay Brexit rather than take Britain out of the EU without a transition deal. �The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,� Johnson was quoted as saying. �Hulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be - and that is the case for this country. We will come out on October 31.� Britain�s parliament has repeatedly rejected the exit deal Johnson�s predecessor Theresa May negotiated with the EU, and this month rejected leaving without a deal - angering many  Britons who voted to leave the bloc more than three years ago. Johnson wants to harness that anger to win a majority in an early national election, but his efforts to call one have so far been thwarted by opposition parties who want to first ensure Britain cannot leave the EU without a deal on Oct. 31. The Liberal Democrats party, which has 18 seats in Britain�s 650-seat parliament, on Sunday made its bid for the votes of those who want remain in the EU, toughening its anti-Brexit stance to say it would stop the exit process if it won power in an election, and would reject any Brexit deal Johnson struck. �If people put into government as a majority government, the �Stop Brexit� party, then stopping Brexit is exactly what people will get,� party leader Jo Swinson said. Johnson has said he wants to negotiate a new deal that does not involve a �backstop�, which would potentially tie Britain against its will to EU rules after it leaves in order to avoid checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The EU has so far insisted on the backstop, and Britain has not presented any detailed alternative. Nonetheless, Johnson said he was �very confident� ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday. �There�s a very, very good conversation going on about how to address the issues of the Northern Irish border. A huge amount of progress is being made,� Johnson told the Mail on Sunday, without giving details. The opposition Labour Party called for more details on what Johnson was proposing. Johnson drew parallels between Britain�s situation in Brexit talks and the frustrations felt by fictional scientist Bruce Banner, who when enraged turned into the super-strong Incredible Hulk, frequently leaving behind a trail of destruction. �Banner might be bound in manacles, but when provoked he would explode out of them,� he said. The Sunday Times reported that Johnson�s senior adviser Dominic Cummings had raised the idea of suspending parliament for a second time. Parliament is currently suspended until Oct. 14 - a decision which is being challenged in the courts by those who say it is an attempt to block debate on Brexit. On Saturday, former Conservative minister Sam Gyimah said he was switching to the pro-EU Liberal Democrat party in protest at Johnson�s Brexit policies and political style, and Swinson said she believed she could win an election. But, polling suggests the Liberal Democrats, who in the party�s modern form have never won more than 62 seats at an election, are unlikely to find themselves in a position to stop Brexit outright. Polls published late on Saturday painted a conflicting picture of the Conservative Party�s political fortunes under Johnson. A poll conducted by Opinium for the Observer newspaper showed Conservative support rose to 37% from 35% over the past week, while Jeremy Corbyn�s Labour held at 25% and Liberal Democrat support dropped to 16% from 17%. Support for Nigel Farage�s Brexit Party remained at 13%. However, a separate poll by ComRes for the Sunday Express put Conservative support at just 28%, down from 30% and only a shade ahead of Labour at 27%. ComRes said just 12% of the more than 2,000 people it survey thought Britain�s parliament could be trusted to do the right thing for the country.

While the headset company struggled to compete for enterprise customers, Daqri benefited from investor excitement surrounding the broader space.

You won�t find many details on the sources of that funding, other than references to Tarsadia Investments, a private-equity firm in Los Angeles that took part in the company�s sole disclosed funding round.

The attacks in Abqaiq and Khurais knocked down some 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of the kingdom�s oil production and Saudi officials have not given a timeline for restoring full supply. nL5N265033  Reporting By Rania El Gamal; editing by Ghaida Ghantous",https://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-attacks-supply/saudis-full-oil-supply-could-take-weeks-to-resume-source-idINKBN1W006G?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1411,Iran rejects US claim it was behind attacks on Saudi oil facilities,"Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi on Sunday dismissed US claim that Iran was behind drone attacks which hit two oil facilities in Saudi Arabia as ""pointless"". ""Such useless accusations...are meaningless and not comprehensible,"" he added. Blaming Iran, US State Secretary Mike Pompeo had said, ""Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply.""",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran rejected accusations by the United States that it was behind attacks on Saudi oil plants that risk disrupting world energy supplies and warned on Sunday that U.S. bases and aircraft carriers in the region were in range of its missiles. Yemen�s Houthi group claimed responsibility for Saturday�s attacks that knocked out more than half of Saudi oil output or more than 5% of global supply, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the assault was the work of Iran, a Houthi ally. The drone strikes on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia�s oil industry, including the world�s biggest petroleum processing facility, were expected to send oil prices up $5-10 per barrel on Monday as tensions rise in the Middle East. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the U.S. allegation as �pointless�. A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned that the Islamic Republic was ready for �full-fledged� war. �All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,� the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying. State oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day, at a time when Aramco is trying to ready itself for what is expected to be the world�s largest share sale. Aramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take �weeks, not days�. Another source briefed on the developments said Saudi oil exports would continue to run as normal this week thanks to large storage in the kingdom. But it remains unclear how long the oil production shut down will continue, because the damage to the infrastructure �was big� and could not be fixed overnight, the source added. Traders and analysts said crude may spike to as high as $100 if Riyadh fails to quickly bring back supply.  The kingdom, the world�s top oil exporter, ships more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day. Riyadh said it would compensate for the loss by drawing on its stocks which stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data. The United States said it was also ready to tap emergency oil reserves if needed. The Saudi bourse closed down 1.1% with banking and petrochemical shares taking the biggest hit. Saudi petrochemical firms announced a significant reduction in feedstock supplies.  �Abqaiq is the nerve center of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24-48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,� Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy�at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters. According to U.S. government information, 15 structures at Abqaiq suffered damage on their west-northwest facing sides. Pompeo said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi�ite Muslim rival Iran. �Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world�s energy supply,� he said. Some Iraqi media outlets said the attack came from there. Baghdad denied this on Sunday and vowed to punish anyone using Iraq, where Iran-backed paramilitary groups wield increasing power, as a launchpad for attacks. Kuwait, which borders Iraq, said it was investigating the sighting of a drone over its territory and coordinating with Saudi Arabia and other countries. The cabinet said the prime minister ordered tighter security at vital installations. Riyadh accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil pumping stations and the Shaybah oilfield, charges Tehran denies. It has not yet blamed any party for Saturday�s strike, but linked it to a recent series of attacks on Saudi oil assets and crude tankers in Gulf waters. Riyadh says Iran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny. Regional tensions have escalated since Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Saturday�s attacks and called on all parties to exercises restraint and prevent any escalation. The European Union warned that the strikes posed a real threat to regional security, Britain called them a �reckless attempt� to disrupt global oil supplies and France said such actions could only worsen �risk of conflict�. Iran�s ally Turkey called for the avoidance of �provocative steps�. U.S.-IRAN TALKS The attack comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was possible at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month. Tehran ruled out talks until sanctions are lifted. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway did not rule out a possible meeting between the two but told �Fox News Sunday� that the strikes �did not help� that prospect.  Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Trump that Riyadh was ready to deal with �terrorist aggression�. The Saudi-led coalition has responded to past Houthi attacks with air strikes on the group�s military sites in Yemen. The conflict has been in military stalemate for years. The alliance has air supremacy but has come under scrutiny over civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis that has left millions facing starvation. The Houthis, more adept at guerrilla warfare, have increased attacks on Saudi cities, thwarting peace efforts. The United Arab Emirates, Riyadh�s main partner in the alliance, has reduced its presence in Yemen due to concern over rising Iran tensions and Western criticism of the war, leaving Riyadh to try to neutralize the Houthi threat along its border.  Iran�s foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said Washington and its allies were �stuck in Yemen� and that blaming Tehran �won�t end the disaster�.

It is accessible from a number of places, including the ""Your Orders"" page, on product pages, or through Amazon customer support.",TechCrunch,"Amazon  is testing an easier way for people to leave product feedback with the launch of one-tap ratings. The change is meant to encourage those who don�t have the time, energy or interest in writing reviews to still share their opinion about the product, which benefits the larger Amazon community of shoppers who are reliant on ratings and reviews to make better purchasing decisions.If you have access to the new experiment, you�ll be able to just tap once to leave your star rating on any item, without having to fill out additional fields like a review title and written review, as previously required.You�ll also be able to access these one-tap ratings from a number of places, including the �Your Orders� page on Amazon where you can tap the �Write a Review� button; by going to a product page directly; or by responding to solicitations sent to you from Amazon or those that appear on the homepage when you log in.The process of leaving a one-tap review is extremely simple � you just select the star rating and you�ll then see a green checkmark confirming the submission.Only those one-tap ratings from Verified Purchases will contribute to the product�s overall star rating. You�re also able to expand on your feedback later on, if you choose, by adding a review, photos or video.The new feature could go a long way toward being able to collect feedback from a larger number of online consumers, as many don�t bother with writing reviews. It also could help balance out the ratings with feedback from real shoppers, as opposed to those who may have been incentivized or paid to leave reviews.That�s against Amazon policy, of course, and is a practice the retailer has been cracking down on for years � including by outright banning incentivized reviews, by way of multiple lawsuits, fines and through suspensions of seller accounts. But there are still services out there offering to boost a product�s Amazon reviews through less-than-official tactics. And there are products on Amazon that continue to have suspiciously positive reviews, ranging from weight loss pills to Bluetooth headphones.Flooding those products with legit reviews from real customers could bring about a more accurate rating, even if Amazon isn�t able to fully flush the scammers from its review community.The new ratings test is showing both online and in the mobile app worldwide. Not everyone will see the feature at this time, as some customers will be in a control group.Amazon confirmed the new feature is an experiment, not a public launch.�We are testing a feature that allows customers to leave feedback easily while also helping shoppers get authentic customer ratings on products from a broader set of shoppers,� an Amazon spokesperson said.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/13/amazon-tests-a-one-tap-review-system-for-product-feedback/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March after two crashes killed 346 people. Boeing has already provided over 3 lakh pages of documents, reports said.",Reuters," (In SEPT 12 story, corrects name of European Union Aviation Safety Agency from European Aviation and Space Agency in paragraph 10) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress on Thursday asked Boeing Co�s chief executive to make several employees available for interviews as part of a congressional probe into the design, development and certification of 737 MAX aircraft involved in two crashes that killed 346 people. House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio and Representative Rick Larsen, who chairs the aviation subcommittee, said in a statement that while Boeing has provided substantial documents and shared senior management�s perspective, �it�s important to the committee�s investigation to hear from relevant Boeing employees.�  The committee plans another Boeing hearing in the coming weeks and previously asked whistleblowers to come forward with any information about the plane�s development. Boeing has provided more than 300,000 pages of documents, a person briefed on the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Boeing said in a statement it was �deeply disappointed the committee chose to release private correspondence given our extensive cooperation to date. We will continue to be transparent and responsive to the committee.� The 737 MAX, Boeing�s best-selling jet, was grounded globally in March, days after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that followed a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. A total of 346 people died in the two crashes. Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation�s inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX as well as how the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies new aircraft. Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights into December as a result of the MAX grounding, including American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines, while Southwest Airlines Co has canceled flights into early January.  CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at an investor conference on Wednesday that the company is still targeting �early fourth quarter for getting the airplane back up in the air� but added that �ultimately return-to-service timing will be determined by the regulator.� The FAA has repeatedly said it will not certify the plane to fly again until it is safe to do so. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said on Tuesday it �intends to conduct its own test flights separate from, but in full coordination with, the FAA. The test flights are not scheduled yet, the date will depend on the development schedule of Boeing.� Muilenburg said it is possible not all regulators around the world will concurrently approve the MAX to fly again. Boeing has said it plans to conduct a certification test flight in the �September time frame� but Muilenburg did not give a specific date when asked on Wednesday. Some officials do not expect the 737 MAX to actually resume flights until early 2020. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 1 that a Boeing briefing in August was cut short by U.S., European and other regulators who complained the company failed to answer specific questions about modifications in the operation of MAX flight-control computers. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed frustration with the lack of some answers from Boeing.

1425,New iPhones may contain hardware to charge other wireless devices,"The 2019 lineup of iPhone may contain necessary hardware for enabling bilateral charging to let the phones wirelessly charge other Qi-compatible wireless devices, as per Australian iPhone information leaker Sonny Dickson. Apple might have reportedly kept the feature disabled within the phones' software. However, Dickson said he was ""uncertain whether this was removed prior to final production"".",Engadget,"Apple's new iPhones may include a hidden feature. Citing ""reliable sources,"" frequent Apple leaker Sonny Dickson says all three new iPhone models include the necessary hardware for bilateral charging, a feature that would allow the phones to wirelessly charge other Qi-compatible devices such as the Apple Watch. Apple, however, has reportedly disabled the feature within the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max's software. Dickson doesn't say why the company did this, which adds another wrinkle to an already interesting saga.Ahead of Tuesday's launch, bilateral charging was one of the things that seemed a sure addition to the iPhone's feature list. Both Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, two of the most accurate sources of pre-release Apple information, said the new iPhones would include the feature. Then, just days before the event, both reversed course.While it's possible Apple could enable the feature in the future (if, in fact, it's there), it seems unlikely. Alongside the iPhone 11, there were rumors Apple planned to announce a Tile-like tracker called Apple Tags on Tuesday. We didn't get Apple Tags on Tuesday, but, at least in that case, there's information on the company's website that suggests they're on their way. There's nothing like that for reverse charging.While mostly a vanity feature on Android phones like the Galaxy S10, bilateral charging has potential utility on the iPhone. Unlike USB-C, Apple's Lightning port doesn't support reverse charging, meaning you can't plug another device into the iPhone to charge it. Additionally, a lot of iPhone users own an Apple Watch and AirPods, and would likely appreciate a way to charge them in a pinch. We probably won't have to wait long to see if there's truth to the rumor. Next week, we should find out if the iPhone 11 has the hardware once groups like iFixit start taking apart the phone.

So get ready to die in hell. Okay? And these friends of mine will feast on you,� the singer says in�the�clip�before introducing her menacing-looking friends, including an alligator.The video, which was allegedly filmed in the singer�s beauty salon in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan�s Punjab province, has since racked up almost 100,000 views, making headlines in both Indian and Pakistani media.However, it was not until this week that the Punjab Wildlife Protection and Parks Department launched an inquiry into the starlet for keeping exotic animals � including pythons and an alligator � at her salon.The Pakistani Wildlife Act prohibits keeping animals like these as pets, Wildlife Protection official Sohail Ashraf said, as quoted by Pakistan�s News International, adding that no permit exists that could be obtained to legalize their ownership. The official said that Pirzada is now looking at up to two years in jail for violating the law, adding that legal proceedings were launched after she repeatedly flaunted exotic animals on social media and her infamous clip was aired on TV.However, the singer herself insists that it was her anti-Modi rant, not her affection for reptiles, that got her into trouble.�For all those sick minded who r reminding me to get Lisence, where was wildlife before my threat to Modi? Can�t u see y they did this,��she�tweeted�on Saturday.Pirzada, a native of the Pakistan-administrated part of disputed Kashmir and daughter of an army officer, has openly voiced her criticism of India�s decision to integrate part of Kashmir under its control, and has recently staged a �Save Kashmir� rally, prompting accusations that she�s on Islamabad�s payroll. Pirzada denies taking orders from the Pakistani government, claiming she has received �zero support� from the authorities.�There are several videos of Pirzada playing with snakes on her YouTube channel, including a two-month old�clip�called �snake charmer�. Pirzada claims that she has always been fascinated with snakes, which are �better than so many friends who are there to betray you.� The authorities are now trying to locate the animals, as the singer reportedly directed them to the wrong address.

1435,US blames Iran for drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused Iran of leading attacks on Saudi oil facilities that have cut the kingdom's output roughly in half. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group has claimed responsibility for the attacks on the two facilities, including the world's biggest petroleum processing facility. The US State Department has declined to provide any evidence to support Pompeo's claim.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday accused Iran of leading attacks on Saudi oil plants that have cut the kingdom�s output roughly in half, as he ruled out Yemeni involvement and denounced Tehran for engaging in false diplomacy. Yemen�s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed credit for the attacks on two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia�s oil industry, including the world�s biggest petroleum processing facility. Pompeo, however, said on Twitter that there was no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. �Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy,� Pompeo said, referring to Iran�s President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif.  �Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world�s energy supply,� he added. The State Department declined to provide any evidence to bolster Pompeo�s claim. �We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran�s attacks,� Pompeo said, warning that the Trump administration would work with its allies to make sure Iran was �held accountable for its aggression.� The tweets signaled a more hawkish stance in Washington toward Tehran, following signs of a possible thaw in relations between the two nations after months of escalation.  Last year, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 pact that aimed to keep a lid on Tehran�s nuclear ambitions and he has imposed a series of sanctions that have crippled Iran�s economy. But in recent weeks, Trump has said he would be open to meeting with Rouhani, perhaps on the sidelines of the United National General Assembly in New York later this month. Pompeo has said such talks could take place without any preconditions. Rouhani, for his part, has said that Tehran, which denies seeking nuclear weapons, would not talk to the United States until Washington lifts the sanctions. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, a close Trump ally and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Saturday�s attacks showed Iran was not interested in peace and was instead pursuing nuclear weapons and regional dominance.    �It is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,� Graham said on Twitter. Others cast doubt on Pompeo�s allegations. �This is such irresponsible simplification and it�s how we get into dumb wars,� Democratic Senator and committee member Chris Murphy tweeted. �Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it�s just not as simple as Houthis=Iran.� Washington�s allies overseas will want to see solid evidence of Iran�s involvement, said Suzanne Maloney, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. �It�s credible that the Iranians had something to do with this,� said Maloney. �We�ll have to wait and see how they�ll (the administration) marshal the evidence.� Saturday�s attacks follow earlier cross-border attacks on Saudi oil installations and on oil tankers in Gulf waters. Saudi Arabia, which leads a Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis, has blamed regional rival Shi�ite Iran for previous attacks. Tehran has denied the allegations. Riyadh also accuses Iran of arming the Houthis, a charge denied both by the group and Tehran. The White House said the United States was committed to keeping oil markets well-supplied in the wake of the attack and the U.S. Energy Department said the administration could release oil from strategic reserves if necessary. The attacks on the two facilities cut Saudi Arabia�s crude oil supply by around 5.7 million barrels per day or about 50% of its output.

1442,Criticism never made me feel bitter or hostile: Kangana,"Kangana Ranaut has said that one cannot ignore the importance of speaking against issues like nepotism, sexual abuse and pay disparity and that the criticism she has received never made her feel bitter or hostile. ""Today, people openly talk about nepotism... But did anyone talk about it earlier? For me, what matters is the larger goal,"" she added.",Times Now,"She has raised her voice against Nepotism and the ill-treatment that Bollywood often reserves for outsiders, and her approach towards addressing those issues has given her a controversial image. Actress Kangana Ranaut says as long as her intention is right, she does not regret anything she said so far.

""I always keep a check on my intention when I raise a voice against anything critical. Because I took names while starting the conversation on nepotism, sexual abuse, pay disparity or ill-treatment that budding actors face, things always went against my career. One cannot however ignore the importance of these topics. Criticism never made me feel bitter or hostile,"" Kangana told IANS.

In 2017, Kangana got into a controversy when she called the celebrated filmmaker Karan Johar, a ""flag bearer of nepotism"" on his television chat show.

""Today, people openly talk about nepotism. They have a clear opinion with a perspective. But did anyone talk about it earlier? For me, what matters is the larger goal. People rethink certain issues now that ignored for years,"" she said.

While she was highly criticised by a section of media for her ugly spat with a journalist during a promotional event of her last release, Judgementall Hai Kya, Kangana points out that the media has also encouraged her a lot for her work. She added that she never holds any criticism about her acting�against anyone.

""As an actress, I am okay with constructive criticism from film critics because it is a part of my job. I have nothing against anyone. But there are many works I do volunteer for society -- like creating awareness to protect nature, planting trees, talking about rivers, and saying no to plastic. If someone makes fun of these efforts, I will not tolerate it,"" said the actress, who recently donated a certain amount of her income for the Cauvery Calling campaign to the Isha Foundation. The campaign is a 12-year-old effort to plant one lakh trees on the Cauvery basin.

1460,Saudi shuts down half its oil output after drone attacks: Reports,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly shut down half of its oil output following drone attacks on Aramco plants. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi group said it deployed 10 drones in the attacks on two plants, including the world's biggest oil processing facility. The shutdown amounts to a loss of about 5 million barrels per day, about 5% of the world's daily oil production.",Reuters,"RIYADH/DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Yemen�s Iran-aligned Houthi group said it attacked two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia�s oil industry on Saturday, knocking out more than half the Kingdom�s output, in a move expected to send oil prices soaring and increase tensions in the Middle East. The attacks will cut the kingdom�s output by 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd), according to a statement from state-run oil company Saudi Aramco, or more than 5% of global oil supply.  The pre-dawn strikes follow earlier cross-border attacks on Saudi oil installations and on oil tankers in Gulf waters, but these were the most brazen yet, temporarily crippling much of the nation�s production capacity. Saudi Arabia is the world�s biggest exporter, shipping more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day, and for years has served as the supplier of last resort to markets.  While the Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack,  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put the blame squarely on Iran, writing on Twitter that there was �no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.�  �Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world�s energy supply,� Pompeo said. Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told U.S. President Donald Trump by telephone that Riyadh had the will and capability �to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,� according to Saudi state news agency SPA. The United States condemned the attacks and Trump told the crown prince that Washington was ready to work with the kingdom to guarantee its security, according to the White House. The U.S. Department of Energy also said it was ready to release oil from its strategic petroleum reserve if necessary. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also said his department would work with the International Energy Agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialized nations, if global action is needed.  Saudi Arabia, leading a Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis, has blamed regional rival Shi�ite Iran for previous attacks, which Tehran denies. Riyadh accuses Iran of arming the Houthis, a charge denied by the group and Tehran. Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said an investigation had been launched into who planned and executed the strikes. He said the Western-backed alliance would counter threats to global energy security and economic stability. Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said there were no casualties from the attacks.  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said Aramco would have more information within 48 hours, and it will draw down oil in storage to compensate for the loss. Aramco is in the process of planning what is expected to be the world�s largest initial public offering. �Abqaiq is perhaps the most critical facility in the world for oil supply,� said Jason Bordoff, who runs the Center On Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and served on the U.S. National Security Council during Barack Obama�s presidency. �The risk of tit-for-tat regional escalation that pushes oil prices even higher has just gone up significantly.�  Abqaiq is 60 km (37 miles) southwest of Aramco�s Dhahran headquarters. The oil processing plant handles crude from the world�s largest conventional oilfield, the supergiant Ghawar, and for export to terminals Ras Tanura - the world�s biggest offshore oil loading facility - and Juaymah. It also pumps westwards across the kingdom to Red Sea export terminals. Two of the sources said Ghawar was flaring gas after the strikes disrupted gas processing facilities. Khurais, 190 km (118 miles) further southwest, contains the country�s second largest oilfield.  �These attacks against critical infrastructure endanger civilians, are unacceptable, and sooner or later will result in innocent lives being lost,� the embassy quoted Ambassador John Abizaid as saying in a Twitter post. Andrew Murrison, a British foreign affairs minister, called on the Houthis to stop threatening civilian areas and Saudi commercial infrastructure. It was the latest in a series of Houthi missile and drone strikes on Saudi cities that had largely been intercepted, but have recently hit targets, including Shaybah oilfield last month and oil pumping stations in May. Both those attacks caused fires but did not disrupt production. �This is a relatively new situation for the Saudis. For the longest time they have never had any real fears that their oil facilities would be struck from the air,� Kamran Bokhari, founding director of the Washington-based Center for Global Policy, told Reuters. Aramco�s CEO said in a statement that the situation had been brought under control. A Reuters witness said the fire in Abqaiq appeared to have been extinguished by early evening.  Regional tensions have escalated after Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran. The violence is complicating U.N.-led peace efforts to end the Yemen war which has killed tens of thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine. The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The coalition intervened in Yemen after the internationally recognized government was ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis, who say they are fighting a corrupt system.

These statements will not lead to betterment of economy. But they will definitely affect the government�s image,� he said. On Sitharaman�s statement about decline in the automobile sector, where she spoke about people using app-based cab services instead of buying car as one of the causes, Sinha asked, �If companies like Ola and Uber caused a drop in passenger vehicle sales, then why there is a slowdown in sales of two-wheelers and trucks?� �Bihar�s finance minister (Sushil Modi) said there is recession due to Sawan-Bhado (the rainy season).A Union minister (Piyush Goyal) is talking about Einstein�s law of gravity,� the former BJP leader said.

Asked about the government�s plan to merge certain public sector banks, he said, �I am not opposed to merger. But it will not reduce their non performing assets automatically.� The process may in fact harm the banks as their officials will get tied up in completing merger formalities instead of focusing on actual banking, Sinha said.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market�s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

It asked the firms to share internal executive communications spanning a decade, related to their acquisitions and prior antitrust probes. The panel aims to see whether the four engaged in anti-competitive practices.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel on Friday demanded internal emails, detailed financial information and other company records from top executives of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, and Alphabet Inc�s Google, widening the antitrust probe of Big Tech. The letters seek by Oct. 14 internal emails over the last decade from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, among others, about acquisitions. Apple shares fell about 1.8% after the market opened. While Apple had been mentioned as a potential target, the House letter offered the first concrete evidence of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation. Apple has faced criticism that its App Store�s policies and algorithms support its own products and stifle third-party applications. On Monday, the Texas attorney general led a group of 50 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories in a probe of whether Google abuses its market power in advertising.  �There is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications,� said House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, who signed the letters along with Ranking Republican Representative Doug Collins and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee and ranking Republican Jim Sensenbrenner. �This information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,� Collins said in a statement. The lawmakers seek emails from senior executives on topics including acquisitions like Amazon�s purchase of AbeBooks, PillPack, Eero, Ring, Zappos and Whole Foods; and Google�s acquisition of AdMob, YouTube, Android and DoubleClick. They also seek information on various policies including Google�s decision to automatically sign into Chrome any user to logs into any Google service. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google referred to a blog post this week that said its services �create choice for consumers.�  The committee requested information from the companies� executives on market share, competitors, their largest customers for specific products and documents from other investigations.   It asked Apple for information on App Store concerns such as the decision to remove some parental control apps and its policy regarding whether iPhone users can set non-Apple apps as defaults.   The committee seeks communications on Facebook�s purchase of Instagram, WhatsApp and Onavo and its decisions to integrate Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and to cut off apps from its social graph. The U.S. Justice Department said in July it is investigating �whether and how� large tech companies in �search, social media, and some retail services online� are engaging in anticompetitive behavior. Google said it received a formal request for documents from the Justice Department in late August.

1469,US sanctions North Korean hackers for global cyberattacks,"The US has imposed sanctions on three North Korean hacking groups it blames for the ""WannaCry"" ransomware attacks among other cyberattacks to fund the country's missile program. Naming them Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel, it said they were controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau which is already under US sanctions. The sanctions will freeze US-related assets of the groups.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Friday announced sanctions on three North Korean hacking groups it said were involved in the �WannaCry� ransomware attacks and hacking of international banks and customer accounts. It named the groups as Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel and said they were controlled by the RGB, North Korea�s primary intelligence bureau, which is already subject to U.S. and United Nations sanctions. The action blocks any U.S.-related assets of the groups and prohibits dealings with them. The Treasury statement said any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitated significant transactions or services for them could also be subject to sanctions. �Treasury is taking action against North Korean hacking groups that have been perpetrating cyber attacks to support illicit weapon and missile programs,� said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.� �We will continue to enforce existing U.S. and U.N. sanctions against North Korea and work with the international community to improve cybersecurity of financial networks.� The United States has been attempting to restart talks with North Korea, aimed at pressing the country to give up its nuclear weapons. The talks have been stalled over North Korean demands for concessions, including sanctions relief. Earlier this month, North Korea denied U.N. allegations it had obtained $2 billion through cyberattacks on banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, and accused the United States of spreading rumors.  The Treasury statement said Lazarus Group was involved in the WannaCry ransomware attack that the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom publicly attributed to North Korea in December 2017. It said WannaCry affected at least 150 countries and shut down about 300,000 computers, including many in Britain�s National Health Service (NHS). The NHS attack led to the cancellation of more than 19,000 appointments and ultimately cost the service over $112 million, the biggest known ransomware attack in history.� The Treasury said Lazarus Group was also directly responsible for 2014 cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures Entertainment. The statement cited industry and press reporting as saying that by 2018, Bluenoroff had attempted to steal over $1.1 billion from financial institutions and successfully carried out operations against banks in Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Chile, and Vietnam.� It said Bluenoroff worked with the Lazarus Group to steal approximately $80 million from the Central Bank of Bangladesh�s New York Federal Reserve account. Andariel, meanwhile, was observed by cyber security firms attempting to steal bank card information by hacking into ATMs to withdraw cash or steal customer information to later sell on the black market, the statement said.� Andariel was also responsible for developing and creating unique malware to hack into online poker and gambling sites and, according to industry and press reporting, targeted the South Korea government military in an effort to gather intelligence, it said.

The National Music Publishers� Association, a trade group, said on Friday that since suing Peloton in March for copyright infringement, publishers have found a trove of additional songs that the New York-based company knowingly and recklessly offered to customers without first getting required licenses. These allegedly included songs from Adele, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, John Legend, Maroon 5, Meek Mill and Taylor Swift, as well as classics such as The Beatles� �I Saw Her Standing There,� Ray Charles� �Georgia On My Mind� and The Who�s �I Can See For Miles.� Publishers want to add 1,324 songs to their lawsuit, the trade group said. �Peloton fully understood what the copyright law required, having entered licenses with certain other copyright holders, while trampling the rights of plaintiffs by using their musical works for free and without permission,� the publishers said in a proposed amended complaint filed late on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan must grant approval before publishers can pursue their expanded case. The proposed complaint was filed two days after Peloton said it planned to raise up to $1.33 billion in an initial public offering, by offering 46 million shares priced between $26 and $29 each. Peloton said its platform could have been developed only through �close collaboration� with major labels and music publishers, among others. �We will continue to defend ourselves against claims made in this matter and look forward to pursuing our counterclaims,� the company said in an emailed statement.

1480,Why wasn't Bairstow penalised for fooling Smith with fake fielding?,"England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow faked collecting the ball which forced Steve Smith to dive in the 30th over of Australia's first innings in fifth Ashes Test. The umpires didn't penalise Bairstow under fake fielding rules as his action was considered to be done ""out of jest"" than out of ""an attempt to cause confusion and prevent a run being scored"".",CricTracker,"The fifth and final Ashes Test is currently in progress at The Oval. Australia have already retained the urn by winning the Manchester Test but are lagging behind in the ongoing encounter. They were bowled out for just 225 runs in response to England�s 294. During the second day�s play though a unique incident hogged the limelight.It happened during the course of play when Steve Smith set off to take a run from the non-striker�s end. And while he was reaching the crease easily, Jonny Bairstow, England wicket-keeper, acted as if the ball had come into his gloves thereby concerning the batsman of getting run-out. Bairstow just imitated as if he was disturbing the bails with the ball in his hands when the throw had come at the bowler�s end.AdvertisementSteve Smith, at the same time, dived in a bid to save himself from getting out only to be fooled by Bairstow. While nothing much was said by the players or the Australian team about the incident, Bairstow had clearly violated the fake fielding rule which was introduced by the ICC recently.According to the existing rule, if a player violates the �fake fielding�, the umpires are entitled to award five runs to the opposition team. But the on-field officials, Kumar Dharmasena and Marais Erasmus, didn�t feel the need to do so which has left many perplexed. If the player deliberately fakes the fielding, then only the umpires can impose the penalty runs.Marnus Labuschagne was the first to violate this rule during Australia domestic One-Day tournament when the umpires had penalised his team. Also, Kumar Sangakkara had once bluffed Ahmed Shehzad during an ODI between Sri Lanka and New Zealand.After the latter incident, Fraser Stewart,�MCC�s Laws of Cricket manager, explained the rule stating that it is up to the umpires to decide if the fielder had faked the fielding �deliberately�. �The Sangakkara example is less clear-cut. Technically, he is deliberately attempting to deceive the batsman, but I�m not sure what advantage he is gaining � not that the gaining of advantage needs to be proved.�It seems to be done more out of jest than out of an attempt to cause confusion and prevent a run being scored. Under the letter of the Law, one could not argue with the penalty being imposed. Equally, however, an umpire might choose to handle it by having a quiet word and informing him of the new law. As with any law like this, it is always going to be for the umpires to decide what is �deliberate� and what is �deception�,� he had told while speaking to ESPNCricinfo.Now if the above explanation is compared with Jonny Bairstow�s incident, the wicketkeeper didn�t gain any advantage as he tried to deceive Steve Smith. Here, it all comes down to the umpires and their judgement. They also have to consider the fact that Smith had to dive to save his wicket due to Bairstow�s actions. While doing so, he could�ve injured himself as well.",https://www.crictracker.com/ashes-2019-why-umpires-did-not-penalise-england-for-jonny-bairstows-fake-fielding/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

And, when women were sedated, there wasn't anyone on his staff that was qualified to monitor the women, in addition to not following best practices for the administration of drugs and emergency procedures.�Klopfer (in green shirt) was accused of failing to report abortions performed on two 13-year-old girls in the time mandated by the state in 2014, but those charges were dismissedKlopfer (in 1994) was said to be Indiana's 'most prolific abortion doctor' and was thought to have performed tens of thousands of abortions since he began doing them in 1973He was said to have had very few complications during the procedures, though.��The doctor was found guilty of five of the nine charges against him during the hearing.�Among those charges was not reporting abortions performed on two girls under the age of 14 within the state's required three-day timeline.�Klopfer had previously come under legal scrutiny in March 2014, after a local right to life organization reported to authorities that he had failed to report abortions on girls under the age of 14 in a timely manner.�Instead of three days, it took Klopfer three to four months to file the paperwork, ABC57 reported. ��Klopfer said at the time: 'Let me put it this way, if there's any question, it's a question about paperwork, it's not a question about any medical malpractice or anything like that.'In addition to having his license suspended, Klopfer was find $3,000. The board said he could petition to have his license reinstated after six months, but that he would need to submit to a long list of evaluations, as well as obtaining continuing medical education credits and child abuse training.�At the time of the hearing, Klopfer was not practicing medicine and had closed his three abortion clinics in Fort Wayne, Gary and South Bend, Illinois, by November 2015. Still, he had indicated that he wanted to reopen clinics when he could.It's unclear if Klopfer had his license reinstated, however.���Klopfer first began performing abortions in 1973 following the legalization of abortion by Roe v. Wade, the Journal Gazette�reported.�The coroner's office has since taken possession of the fetuses found on Klopfer's property and Illinois' Will County Sheriff, coroner and state's attorney are conducting an ongoing investigation into the remains, according to the News-Herald.�Klopfer's family is said to be cooperating with authorities.��",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7462939/Remains-2-000-fetuses-home-former-abortion-doctor.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

A recent patent filing from the company details a clamshell device concept whose hinge is filled with a liquid or gas to reduce strain on a foldable display and prevent debris from getting inside -- both sore points for foldables as of late. You could close this shut without worrying quite so much about wear and tear.Notably, the patent comes from Microsoft's technology licensing team. That suggests this isn't necessarily reserved for a specific device, or even Microsoft devices in general. Instead, Microsoft might license the technology to other hardware makers as foldable screens become more practical.You're unlikely see a foldable Surface tablet at Microsoft's October 2nd event, if you see one at all. While one rumor hinted that the company was relatively far into development of Centaurus, a large dual-screen PC running a stripped-down Windows Lite, that doesn't mean it will have a folding display.

The video giant will no longer count ad views toward rankings on the YouTube Music Charts, instead relying solely on ""organic"" views like direct links, embeds, searches and the Trending section.  This won't affect the achievements for previous videos, but any artist or label hoping to set a 24-hour record will have to do it by attracting viewers, not by spending a mountain of money on ads.As Rolling Stone observed, the outgoing system effectively let companies pay to climb the charts.  YouTube's TrueView ads let marketers play shortened versions of videos that would count as views if you either watched for long enough or interacted with them.  This let artists and labels game the system by purchasing enough ads to help a song rise to the top.  Indian rapper Badshah managed to outperform K-pop megastars BTS through ads, Bloomberg added, while Blackpink, Taylor Swift and others also benefited from the approach.The move won't necessarily lead to fewer music video ads.  The promos still translate to greater exposure.  However, it could force the industry to stagger those ads and think about longer-term success instead of bombarding users for a short period to artificially inflate views and claim a temporary victory.  YouTube didn't have much choice as it is. As long as ads counted toward views, the credibility of its charts was tarnished.

But the amount of work that we�ve done in last one year, I don�t think even an elected government does that much work.�Jammu and Kashmir has been under an unprecedented lockdown since August 5 when the Centre scrapped Article 370 and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories.

1499,Autonomous vehicle startup Voyage raises $31 million,"Silicon Valley's autonomous vehicle startup Voyage has raised $31 million in a Series B round led by investment management firm Franklin Templeton. Jaguar Land Rover's InMotion Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures and Khosla Ventures also took part in the round. Co-founded in 2017 by Oliver Cameron and MacCallister Higgins, the startup operates self-driving cab services in retirement communities.",TechCrunch,"Voyage,  the autonomous vehicle startup that spun out of Udacity, announced Thursday it has raised $31 million in a round led by Franklin Templeton.Khosla Ventures,  Jaguar Land Rover�s InMotion Ventures and Chevron Technology Ventures  also participated in the round. The company, which operates a ride-hailing service in retirement communities using self-driving cars supported by human safety drivers, has raised a total of $52 million since launching in 2017. The new funding includes a $3 million convertible note.Voyage CEO Oliver Cameron  has big plans for the fresh injection of capital, including hiring and expanding its fleet of self-driving Chrysler  Pacifica minivans, which always have a human safety driver behind the wheel.Ultimately, the expanded G2 fleet and staff are just the means toward Cameron�s grander mission to turn Voyage into a truly driverless and profitable ride-hailing company.�It�s not just about solving self-driving technology,� Cameron told TechCrunch in a recent interview, explaining that a cost-effective vehicle designed to be driverless is the essential piece required to make this a profitable business.The company is in the midst of a hiring campaign that Cameron hopes will take its 55-person staff to more than 150 over the next year.�Voyage has had some success attracting high-profile people to fill executive-level positions, including CTO Drew Gray, who previously worked at Uber ATG, Otto, Cruise and Tesla, as well as former NIO and Tesla  employee Davide Bacchet as director of autonomy.Funds will also be used to increase its fleet of second-generation self-driving cars (called G2) that are currently being used in a 4,000-resident retirement community in San Jose, Calif., as well as The Villages, a 40-square-mile, 125,000-resident retirement city in Florida. Voyage�s G2 fleet has 12 vehicles. Cameron didn�t provide details on how many vehicles it will add to its G2 fleet, only describing it as a �nice jump that will allow us to serve consumers.�Voyage used the G2 vehicles to create a template of sorts for its eventual driverless vehicle.�This driverless product � a term Cameron has used in a previous post on Medium�� will initially be limited to 25 miles per hour, which is the driving speed within the two retirement communities in which Voyage currently tests and operates. The vehicle might operate at a low speed, but they are capable of handling complex traffic interactions, he wrote.�It won�t be the most cost-effective vehicle ever made because the industry still is in its infancy, but it will be a huge, huge, huge improvement over our G2 vehicle in terms of being be able to scale out a commercial service and make money on each ride,� Cameron said.�Voyage initially used modified Ford Fusion vehicles to test its autonomous vehicle technology, then introduced in July 2018 Chrysler Pacifica minivans, its second generation of autonomous vehicles. But the end goal has always been a driverless product.TechCrunch previously reported that the company has partnered with an automaker to provide this next-generation vehicle that has been designed specifically for autonomous driving. Cameron wouldn�t name the automaker. The vehicle will be�electric and it won�t be a retrofit like the Chrysler�Pacifica Hybrid vehicles Voyage currently uses or its first-generation vehicle, a Ford Fusion.Most importantly, and a detail Cameron did share with TechCrunch, is that the vehicle it uses for its driverless service will have redundancies and safety-critical applications built into it.Voyage also has deals in place with Enterprise Fleet Management and Intact insurance company to help it scale.�You can imagine leasing is much more optimal than purchasing and owning vehicles on your balance sheet,� Cameron said. �We have those deals in place that will allow us to not only get the vehicle costs down, but other aspects of the vehicle into the right place as well.�",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/voyage-raises-31-million-to-bring-driverless-taxis-to-communities/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

After the World Cup, it was communicated that Dhoni won�t be the national team�s number one keeper. Rather, he would be a part of the transition process with Rishabh Pant being groomed. The plans are also being made, bearing in mind the 2020 edition of the T20 World Cup in Australia.Most of the pundits have had their say on when the 38-year-old Dhoni should call it quits.

1508,Using drones to study Amazon rainforest's health: Harvard team,"Harvard University researchers are using specifically-engineered drones to monitor the effects of climate change on the Amazon rainforest's health. Researchers aim to monitor unique chemical signatures emitted by plants species, which change if they are under stress, in varied ecosystems. They began work in 2017 with Amazonas State University and the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation.",Engadget,"Researchers from Harvard University are using drones to better understand the Amazon rainforest. With drone-based sensors, the researchers hope to determine the unique ""fingerprint"" of different rainforest ecosystems. That could help them monitor the health of the forest and understand how it's responding to climate change, deforestation and fire.Every plant emits a different volatile organic compound (VOC) signature, or fingerprint, which can change based on factors like drought or flood. By monitoring these signals, scientists can study how forest ecosystems adapt to stressors. Despite that valuable info, the Amazon's VOCs were previously monitored by just a handful of towers built in one type of ecosystem. The data was limited and biased, and biosphere emissions models assumed nearby ecosystems had the same VOC emissions.Since 2017, researchers from Harvard, Amazonas State University (UEA) and the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation (FAPEAM) have been working on a drone-based system to map the VOCs emitted in different ecosystems in central Amazonia.Their research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, proves that different ecosystems have different VOC signatures. Next, the team plans to sample more ecosystems in water-logged valleys along rivers. They'll use a boat as a launching platform, and hope to test a three-drone fleet.""This research highlights how little we understood forest heterogeneity,"" said Harvard professor Scot Martin. ""But drone-assisted technologies can help us understand and quantify VOC emissions in different, nearby ecosystems in order to better represent them in climate and air quality model simulations.""Advancements in drone technology could make research like this more common. Already, Boeing is working on a solar-powered drone that will gather climate data and atmospheric research, and of course, we've seen drones put to use surveying farms and crops.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/13/harvard-university-drones-research-amazon-rainforest/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1514,Afghan Taliban sends team to Russia after US talks collapse,The Taliban has sent a delegation to Russia to discuss prospects for a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan following collapse of talks with the US this month. Taliban said US President Donald Trump's decision to call off the peace process came at a time when both sides had resolved all outstanding issues and were about to sign an agreement.,Reuters,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban have sent a delegation to Russia to discuss prospects for a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan following the collapse of talks with the United States this month, officials from the insurgent group said. The move, days after U.S. President Donald Trump canceled a planned meeting with Taliban leaders at his Camp David retreat, came as the movement looks to bolster regional support, with visits also planned for China, Iran and Central Asian states. �The purpose of these visits is to inform leaders of these countries about the peace talks and President Trump�s decision to call off the peace process at a time when both sides had resolved all outstanding issues and were about to sign a peace agreement,� said a senior Taliban leader in Qatar. Russia, which has hosted meetings between the Taliban and Afghan political and civil society representatives, said this week it hoped that the process could be put back on track and urged both sides to resume talks. �We are convinced that the complete end to foreign military presence is an inalienable condition of durable peace in Afghanistan,� Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday. However, it is unclear whether the talks can be resumed. The Taliban leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the purpose of the visits was not to try to revive negotiations with the United States but to assess regional support for forcing it to leave Afghanistan. U.S. and Taliban officials held months of talks in the Qatari capital of Doha and agreed a draft accord that would have seen some 5,000 U.S. troops withdrawn from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the Taliban. However, the deal, intended as a preliminary step to a wider peace agreement, faced heavy criticism from the Afghan government, which was shut out of the talks. Many former senior U.S. officials who had worked in the region also warned a hasty withdrawal risked destabilizing the country and even plunging it back into a new round of civil war. The draft accord did not include a ceasefire agreement and with violence continuing, Trump announced the cancellation of the Camp David meeting via Twitter after a suicide bomb attack in Kabul killed at least 12 people including a U.S. soldier. He subsequently described the talks as dead and said U.S. forces would step up operations against the Taliban, who control more territory than at any time since they were ousted from power by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001.

1515,16-year-old climate activist protests outside White House,"Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Friday protested outside the White House. The 16-year-old was greeted by hundreds of mostly young people carrying signs reading 'People or Profit?' and 'Warming!', and chanting 'This is a crisis, act like it!'. Notably, US President Donald Trump is among the few global leaders who have openly questioned the science of climate change.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who shot to global fame for inspiring worldwide student strikes to promote action against climate change, took her mission to U.S. President Donald Trump�s doorstep on Friday with a protest outside the White House. Thunberg, wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt with her hair loosely pulled back in a ponytail, was greeted with a hero�s welcome by hundreds of mostly young people carrying signs reading �People or Profit?� and �Warming!�, and chanting �This is a crisis, act like it!� and �Business as usual is not enough.�  �This is very overwhelming,� she said softly into a megaphone after a march in front of the White House in which she walked amidst the other activists instead of in front - sometimes hard to hear over the cheers.  �See you next week,� she said toward the end of the event, referring to a planned Sept. 20 global �Climate Strike� in which youth and adults are encouraged to walk out of school or work to urge more action on climate change. The demonstration marked the first high-profile event of Thunberg�s six-day visit to Washington, intended to pressure the Trump administration and Congress ahead of a United Nations climate summit, where world leaders will be asked to ramp up their carbon emissions cutting to fend off global warming. Trump is among a small minority of global leaders who has openly questioned the science of climate change. He has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement � a global pact to stem the rise in global temperatures - and has a policy of maximizing American production of fossil fuels.  Thunberg has said she does not believe she can convince Trump or other climate change doubters that global warming is real, but hopes they will take briefings from �actual scientists and experts in this area.� here The 16-year-old activist gained attention last year, when she started skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Sweden�s parliament. After arriving in the United States in August by sailboat to reduce her carbon footprint, she is bound for New York later this month, where she will take part in the U.N. climate summit. While in Washington, Thunberg will address Congress on climate change and later join Democratic lawmakers and plaintiffs in the Juliana v the United States case - in which a group of young people sued the government for failing to address climate change � at the Supreme Court. Thunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize earlier this year after the number of students taking part in her strikes - dubbed �Fridays for Future� - broke 2 million across 135 countries. She was named one of the world�s most influential people by Time magazine in May.  Jennifer Morash, a doctoral candidate in plant science, brought her daughter Adeline, 9, to the rally to see Thunberg after getting permission from her school in Maryland.  �I just want to make sure we all have a happy future and for people to take climate change seriously,� Adeline said.

1520,"Top trader body seeks ban on Amazon, Flipkart's festive season sales","The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has asked the government to ban upcoming festive sales on Amazon and Flipkart, saying their deep discounts violate FDI rules. It also demanded a ""blanket ban"" on such sales and asked the government to probe the potential violation of FDI norms. Both Amazon and Flipkart said sellers decide the pricing for their products.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - A leading Indian trader body asked the government on Friday to ban upcoming festive sales on Amazon�s local unit and its rival Flipkart, saying their deep discounts violate the country�s foreign investment rules for online retail. The two e-commerce firms typically hold annual festive season sales ahead of key Hindu festivals Dussehra and Diwali, which are due this year in October, when Indians make big ticket purchases such as cars and gold jewelry. Walmart-owned Flipkart�s six-day sale begins Sept. 29, while Amazon is yet to announce dates. Both e-retailers promise big discounts on everything from fashion to smartphones to home appliances and have previously said discounts and deals are offered by sellers on their platforms. �By offering deep discounts ranging from 10% to 80% on their e-commerce portals, these companies are clearly influencing the prices and create an uneven level playing field which is in direct contravention of the policy,� the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said in a letter to the federal trade minister. CAIT, which represents 500,000 merchants and traders in India, also demanded a �blanket ban� on such sales and asked the government to probe the potential violation of FDI norms. Its demand is unlikely to see government action before this year�s sales kick off but it could help frame government policy on deep discounts. India does not allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in inventory-driven models of e-commerce, used by Walmart and Amazon in the United States, where goods and services are owned by an e-commerce firm that sells directly to retail customers. It modified e-commerce rules late last year to protect the country�s vast unorganized retail sector that does not have the clout to purchase at scale and offer big discounts. Those rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to reconfigure ownership structures and re-jig some key vendor relationships and agreements. Asked for comment, Flipkart said more than 100,000 sellers on its platform awaited its �Big Billion Days� sale event. �We empower our sellers with business insights that allow them to decide the best value for their own products, so they can deliver benefits and savings to consumers and scale their businesses at the same time,� said Rajneesh Kumar, chief corporate affairs officer at Flipkart Group. Amazon said more than 500,000 sellers - a bulk of which are small businesses, women entrepreneurs, startups, weavers and artisans - use the festive sale to reach customers. �Sellers decide the pricing for their products on our marketplace,� a spokeswoman for Amazon said. �They offer their choice of selection to their customers across the country at prices that they deem fit.� Amazon last month said at an open panel discussion, organized by India�s competition watchdog, that it abides by all Indian rules and does not influence pricing of products on its website.

""The decision has been taken on the directives of CM Yogi Adityanath,"" Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said. The direction comes after the law was criticised in the media.",The New Indian Express,"LUCKNOW: The Uttar government on Friday decided that ministers will start paying their own income tax, ending a four-decade-old practice of the state exchequer shelling out the amount annually for them.The direction follows criticism in the media of a law enacted in 1981 which ensures that the state's chief minister and ministers don't pay any income tax themselves.Instead, their share is shelled out by the state government under the Uttar Pradesh Ministers' Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Act, 1981.After a news report made this revelation, several politicians said they were not even aware of the provision in the UP Act.Late in the evening, the state government announced that the provision will be scrapped.""UP chief ministers and all ministers will pay their own income tax. The income tax bill till now was paid through the state treasury,""�Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said in a statement.""The decision has been taken on the directives of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath,""�he added.The law, enacted when Vishwanath Pratap Singh was the chief minister, has been in force during the terms of 19 CMs and about 1,000 ministers so far.The chief ministers who saved on their taxes have been from across parties -- including Yogi Adityanath, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash Gupta, Rajnath Singh, Sripati Mishra, Vir Bahadur Singh and N D Tiwari.ALSO READ |�Uttar Pradesh�exchequer paying�income tax of CMs and ministers since 1981, parties in shockFor the last financial year, the state government paid Rs 86 lakh as the ministers' tax bill, a senior finance ministry official said.A section of the Act says, ""The salary referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) shall be exclusive of the tax payable in respect of such salary (including perquisites) under any law relating to income tax for the time being in force, and such tax shall be borne by the state.""It was argued in 1981 that the state government should bear the income tax burden as most ministers were from poor backgrounds and had meagre incomes, a Congress leader and a colleague of the then chief minister V P Singh said.But over the years, the state has been led by leaders like Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati who is worth Rs 111 crore as per her affidavit for the Rajya Sabha polls in 2012.Another former chief minister, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, owns assets worth over Rs 37 crore together with his wife Dimple, according to the affidavit filed for the recent Lok Sabha polls.According to the affidavit submitted for the Legislative Council elections in 2017, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's assets total Rs 95,98,053.Hours before the government's decision to end the practice, Uttar Pradesh Power Minister Shrikant Sharma confirmed the existence of the 40-year-old provision in law.He said the government will look into any suggestion in the future on the issue.Congress leader and former MP, P L Punia said the provision didn't seem right and needed review.""The salaries have gone up several times and there appears to be no relevance for this relaxation. It needs reconsideration and withdrawal,"" Punia, who was the principal secretary to Mayawati when she was chief minister, said.Many like BSP leader and former UP finance minister Lalji Verma said they were not aware of the law.Verma said as far he remembers he used to pay his own taxes.Earlier in the day, the state's Law Minister Brijesh Pathak said he will be in a position to speak on the issue only after getting it verified from his officials.Social activist Anil Kumar said the news was a shocker for the common man who pays large sums in taxes.""Why should he bear the burden of those who have all the benefits.

Cole won the World Press Photo award for his picture in 1990. Cole had hidden the undeveloped film roll in the bathroom, fearing he would be searched by Chinese authorities.",The New Indian Express,"VIETNAM: Charlie Cole, one of the photographers who captured the famous Tank Man on film during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, has died. He was 64.

He died last week in Bali, Indonesia, where he had been residing, the BBC reported on Friday.

Cole was one of four photographers that captured the image on June 5, 1989, of the man standing in the way of a column of tanks, a day after hundreds possibly thousands of people died.

Cole won the 1990 World Press Photo award for his picture which became a defining image of the 1989 pro-democracy protests.

He took his picture for Newsweek with a telephoto lens from the balcony of a hotel, framing it so the man was only just in the bottom left corner.

Cole later described how he had expected the man would be killed, and felt it was his responsibility to record what was happening.

But the unidentified protester was eventually pulled away from the scene by two men. What happened to him remains unknown.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/sep/13/famous-tiananmen-square-tank-man-photographer-charlie-cole-passes-away-2033096.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1576,Playing Federer or Nadal will be psychologically challenging: Murray,"Former world number one Andy Murray has said he needs four or five months to play top-level tennis and taking on Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal would probably be ""psychologically challenging"". ""I need to be patient and not expect too much too soon,"" he added. The 32-year-old is regaining his fitness after a hip resurfacing procedure in January.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray said he still needs four or five months to play top-level tennis so that he can again take on old rivals Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal after career-saving hip surgery earlier this year. The 32-year-old is regaining his fitness after a hip resurfacing procedure in January, and late last month recorded the first two victories of his singles comeback at the Rafa Nadal Open Challenger tournament in Mallorca before making a third-round exit. Briton Murray, who has dropped to 415 in the world rankings, will next compete in Zhuhai, Beijing and Shanghai in the Asian swing of the ATP tour this year, but the three-times major winner thinks that it will be 2020 before he is �maybe� able to face the challenge of playing Federer or Nadal. �For years... I competed against them, although I haven�t won every time. I�ve lost more than I�ve won but I always went out onto court feeling I could win,� Murray told Sky Sports. �I don�t know if I�d enjoy going out on court against them knowing I�m going to lose or feeling like I had no chance. That would probably be psychologically challenging... I need to be patient and not expect too much too soon. �But maybe in four or five months, I can get there. In terms of how I�m hitting the ball in practice... the skill is still there. I physically need to get a little better and hopefully over time I get a little bit faster... I think I will.� Murray is hopeful of being picked in Britain�s Davis Cup team for the Nov. 18-24 Finals in Madrid, adding he would be happy playing only doubles if necessary. �If I�m selected I�ll play. I don�t want to play or be selected just because four years ago I played really well,� Murray, who guided Britain to the title in 2015, added. �I�d like to help and be in the team and play singles, but if I was asked to play doubles I�d probably do that.� Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-murray/murray-hopes-to-be-fit-enough-by-next-year-to-play-federer-nadal-idUSKCN1VY0N5?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1579,WeWork cuts CEO Adam Neumann's voting power amid IPO plans,"Co-working space startup WeWork's owner The We Company has cut the voting power of Co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann to reportedly revive demand for its planned IPO. The startup, seeking a valuation of less than half from before, said the changes were ""in response to market feedback"". It decreased Neumann's superior voting shares to 10 votes per share from 20.",Reuters," (This September 13 story corrects grammar in paragraph 3) By Joshua Franklin, Anirban Sen and Jessica DiNapoli (Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company may seek a valuation in its upcoming initial public offering of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a dramatic discount to the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Were the We Company to press on with the IPO at such a low valuation, it would represent a major turning point in the venture capital industry�s growth over the last decade, which has led to the rise of startups such as Uber Technologies Inc, Snap Inc and Airbnb Inc. It would mean that the We Company would be valued at less than the $12.8 billion in equity it has raised since it was founded in 2010, according to data provider Crunchbase. And it would be a blow to its biggest backer, Japan�s SoftBank Group Corp, at a time it is trying to amass $108 billion from investors for its second Vision Fund.  The sources cautioned that no decision has been made and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. WeWork and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The We Company is under pressure to proceed with the IPO, despite the big valuation drop, to secure funding for its operations. It rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases. Investors have expressed concerns about the U.S. office-sharing start-up�s business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, raising questions about how it would weather an economic downturn.  The We Company�s deliberations indicate it does not feel confident that the corporate governance changes it unveiled on Friday, slightly loosening CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann�s grip on the company, will be enough to woo investors concerned about its lack of a path to profitability. The WeWork brand is strongly tied to Neumann, a flamboyant, freewheeling 40-year-old Israel-born entrepreneur who has said that the We Company�s mission is �to elevate the world�s consciousness.� His wife, Rebekah Neumann, serves as the chief brand officer and is a powerful figure inside the company. The We Company�s corporate governance changes are largely symbolic, aimed at showing the We Company is listening to investors after being forced to slash its IPO price expectations, corporate governance experts said. Last month, it was considering an IPO valuation of around $20 billion. �That change is seemingly cosmetic in nature,� said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware, referring to the We Company�s announcement it will reduce Neumann�s voting power. �He will still control the composition of the board.� The office space sharing startup said it was making the changes �in response to market feedback.� It said Neumann�s superior voting shares will decrease to 10 votes per share from 20, though he will retain majority control of the company.  Neumann will also give the company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with We Company. He will also limit his ability to sell shares in the second and third years after the IPO to no more than 10% of his stock. No member of Neumann�s family will be on the company�s board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor. The We Company also disclosed it will list shares on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. It plans to complete the IPO this month, and its IPO investor roadshow could launch as early as next week, Reuters has reported.  This is the second effort to repair damage done to the company�s image among investors. Earlier this month, it added a new member, Frances Frei, to its all-male board and said Neumann would return a $5.9 million payment for use of the trademarked word �We.�  �For all the attention being given to �governance reform� at the We Company, entrenchment through unequal voting rights remains firmly in place,� said Glenn Davis, director of research at the Council of Institutional Investors. SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son has been pushing Neumann to delay the We Company�s IPO, but has so far failed to persuade him, Reuters has previously reported. Were the We Company to delay its IPO, it would have to find debt financing to replace a $6 billion loan package it clinched from banks last month. This debt deal is contingent on the We Company raising at least $3 billion in its IPO. Talks were ongoing on Friday between Neumann and Son about whether SoftBank would participate in the We Company�s IPO, with no decision yet taken, one of the sources said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Friday that SoftBank was considering spending at least $750 million to buy shares in the IPO.  The last time SoftBank invested in the We Company was in January at a $47 billion valuation, injecting $2 billion of cash in the New York-based startup.

According to sources, police lobbed tear gas shells and used water cannons to disperse CPI(M) youth and students� wing activists, who pelted stones at them.Members of the Students� Federation of India (SFI) and the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) on Thursday took out a rally from Singur, the venue of the abandoned Tata Nano car plant, demanding jobs for the youth of the state.The rally was scheduled to culminate at the state secretariat on Friday afternoon, but was stopped near Mullick Ghat in Howrah, 5 km away. Sources said the activists, in their attempt to move forward, broke one of the three barricades set up by the police at Mullick Ghat.A scuffle ensued with the police shortly after, with the agitators hurling bricks at the security personnel, who retaliated with tear gas shells and baton charge, they said. �We were told by the police that five of our representatives would be allowed to go to Nabanna to submit a deputation. But as soon as our peaceful rally reached Mullick Ghat, police resorted to unprovoked lathi charge and tear gas shell firing,� DYFI state secretary Sayandeep Mitra said.A number of SFI and DYFI workers fell unconscious during the clash, he said. �We were to submit thousands of applications seeking jobs and answers on various other issues from Banerjee, as part of the TMC government�s �Didi ke Bolo� public outreach initiative,� Mitra told reporters.The Mamata Banerjee government had been sitting on the �debris of an industry� in Singur, he claimed. �She has failed to bring about economic development in West Bengal.

1593,China tells state firms to take control of Hong Kong firms: Reports,"China has called on its biggest state-run firms to take control of Hong Kong companies instead of just holding stakes in them, Reuters reported. China urged representatives from nearly 100 of China's largest state-run companies to help calm the unrest in Hong Kong. The companies reportedly pledged to invest more in key Hong Kong industries, including real estate and tourism.",Reuters,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China has called on its biggest state firms to take a more active role in Hong Kong, including stepping up investment and asserting more control of companies in the financial hub, executives familiar with the matter said, as Beijing attempts to calm months of unrest in the city. At a meeting this week in Shenzhen, the city bordering Hong Kong, senior representatives from nearly 100 of China�s largest state-run companies were urged to do their part to help cool China�s biggest political crisis in years, three executives, including one who was present, told Reuters. At the meeting, the SOEs pledged to invest more in key Hong Kong industries including real estate and tourism in a bid to create jobs for local citizens and stabilize financial markets, two of the executives said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. No specific investments were discussed or agreed upon, they said. The state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in attendance included oil giant Sinopec and conglomerate China Merchants Group, one of the sources said. The meeting was organized by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), the powerful central body that oversees China�s sprawling state sector, which includes some of the world�s biggest companies in industries such as steel, energy, shipping and telecoms. SASAC did not respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters. Officials at Sinopec and China Merchants Group did not respond to emailed requests for comment and calls to the two companies went unanswered. Instead of simply holding stakes in Hong Kong companies, the Chinese SOEs were also urged to look to control companies and have decision-making power in them, one of the people familiar with the meeting said. �The business elites in Hong Kong are certainly not doing enough. Most of them are just not one of us,� the SOE executive who was at the meeting told Reuters. SASAC�s Communist Party chief, Hao Peng, appeared in Hong Kong on Wednesday at a forum for the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative and said that SOEs were looking for ways to cooperate in major projects in the city, according to a SASAC news release. Hao, who was accompanied by a group of SOE executives, also met with Carrie Lam, the city�s chief executive. While China�s big state firms are for-profit enterprises and many are publicly traded, they have long been expected to do national service, including maintaining high levels of employment and helping Beijing execute initiatives such as its big Belt & Road infrastructure plan. Months of huge and often-violent protests in Hong Kong were triggered by planned legislation that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland courts. The protests have been fueled by what is seen by many in Hong Kong as creeping Chinese influence that is a eroding the �one country, two system� model under which China has ruled Hong Kong since its handover from the United Kingdom in 1997. Widening mainland influence in Hong Kong has included the purchase of corporate assets and real estate. The Hong Kong economy was once dominated by British trading houses with roots in the 19th century. Local tycoons started to take over many of the businesses in the latter part of the 20th century, creating huge conglomerates such as Li Ka-shing�s CK Hutchison Holdings (0001.HK) Beijing has been willing to put pressure on Hong Kong businesses to be more patriotic, expressing unhappiness during an August meeting with the city�s business elites that they weren�t doing enough to quiet the protests, according to a report at the time by the state-run Xinhua news agency. In the meeting last month with about 500 business leaders and pro-Beijing politicians from Hong Kong, Chinese authorities urged that they should �have no fears and stand up� to stop violence in the city, Xinhua reported. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK), a legacy of Hong Kong�s colonial era, has become the biggest corporate casualty of the protests after Beijing demanded it suspend staff who support the demonstrations. Its chairman announced plans to step down in November, less than three weeks after CEO Rupert Hogg left amid mounting regulatory scrutiny.  Hong Kong subway operator MTR Corp (0066.HK) also bowed to pressure in August to get tough on anti-government protesters after Chinese state media expressed dismay at the firm for its perceived facilitation of the spread of violence by protesters.

1595,London Stock Exchange rejects Hong Kong Exchanges' $39 bn takeover bid,London Stock Exchange (LSE) board has unanimously rejected Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's $39 billion takeover offer. The 300-year-old British bourse said it remains committed to its proposed acquisition of financial information provider Refinitiv. Hong Kong Exchanges said its takeover would only happen if the LSE ended its deal with Refinitiv.,Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong�s exchange refused to give up on its bid to take over the London Stock Exchange after the British bourse emphatically rejected its $39 billion takeover offer on Friday. The Hong Kong exchange said it would now hold more talks with LSE investors as it considers its next step, aiming to keep alive its hopes of becoming a more global player to rival U.S. giants ICE and CME. �HKEX believes that shareholders in LSEG should have the opportunity to analyse in detail both transactions and will continue to engage with them,� it said in a statement. The LSE said earlier on Friday, as it rebuffed the Hong Kong approach, that it was sticking with its $27 billion acquisition of data and analytics company Refinitiv - a deal that the HKEX offer had required the London exchange to abandon.   It told HKEX in a letter that it had fundamental concerns about key aspects of its takeover proposal which it said had no strategic merit, and that HKEX�s relationship with the Hong Kong government would �complicate matters�. HKEX�s valuation of the LSE falls �substantially short� and the �ongoing situation in Hong Kong� adds to uncertainty for shareholders, the London bourse added, a reference to weeks of pro-democracy street protests in the former British colony. �Accordingly, the board unanimously rejects the conditional proposal and, given its fundamental flaws, sees no merit in further engagement,� the LSE said in a statement. HKEX, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said it was disappointed the LSE has refused to �properly engage� in a compelling proposal.  A source close to HKEX added the quick dismissal of the surprise offer, announced on Wednesday, meant the Hong Kong bourse had very little time to discuss their proposal with investors, a sentiment echoed by some shareholders.  �As shareholders in LSE, it�s difficult to evaluate the merits of a combination with HKEX as we have been given no information on potential synergies,� said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA, which holds a small stake.  LSE shares, however, rose on the news of the offer rejection and closed up 2.73% at 7,450 pence.  LSE�s blunt rejection letter said the Hong Kong offer did not meet its strategic objectives. It said it was sticking with its core strategy of expanding into data with the Refinitiv deal, rather than taking a �significant backward step� by bulking up on market transactions in the HKEX proposal. The LSE also said a Hong Kong takeover could well be rejected by regulators or governments in Britain, the United States and Italy. HKEX�s assertion that implementing the deal would be swift and certain �is simply not credible�, it added. The LSE also owns the Milan exchange and has a significant American presence through its FTSE Russell index subsidiary and LCH, its derivatives clearing house which dominates the U.S. dollar swap market. HKEX added on Friday that it had held initial constructive discussions with regulators and policymakers. But a regulatory source in Britain said no substantive discussions had been held on the proposed deal so far. The flat rejection indicates HKEX boss Charles Li is unlikely to win the LSE board round with an improved financial offer, meaning he may have to go hostile if he wants to persist. He would need to launch a major charm offensive with investors to convince them the LSE board is wrong. However a source close to the LSE said even if the cash component of HKEX�s cash-and shares offer was raised, it would increase the risk for a combined group by piling on more leverage. The source said a higher bid by the Hong Kong exchange or going hostile was unlikely to succeed because its proposal was �just too weak on every fundamental point�. A deal will be also challenging given the troubled history of big exchange mergers, combined with Hong Kong�s current unrest. The industry has been littered with attempts at cross-border tie-ups for over a decade as profits from the traditional business of running stock markets and clearing houses have fallen. But proposed deals have collapsed in the face of regulatory and political opposition to core parts of a country�s financial system falling into foreign hands.  This has pushed exchanges to look for related businesses for growth, with the likes of LSE and New York Stock Exchange owner ICE driving into more profitable and less politically sensitive areas like data and analytics, where revenue is rising.  �This (rejection) certainly makes it clear that even if the HK exchange were to reconsider the terms of the transaction, it shows fundamentally the LSE board would prefer to go down the Refinitiv route,� said Michael Werner, analyst at UBS. HKEX made its offer just two days after its officials travelled to London to present it to LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer for the first time. It has been coolly received by shareholders on both sides so far.  Analysts said a perception that Beijing is exerting growing influence over Hong Kong was a key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government�s close links with the HKEX. The Hong Kong government is the biggest shareholder in HKEX, with a 6% stake and approves six of the 13 board members. Hong Kong is entering a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.  Fitch Ratings said, before the LSE�s rejection of the offer, that �increasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong� could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security. HKEX, for its part, had touted the deal as providing London with a major gateway to the Chinese economy, but the LSE said HKEX did not provide the best long-term option. �We value our mutually beneficial partnership with the Shanghai Stock Exchange which is our preferred and direct channel to access the many opportunities with China,� the LSE said. The LSE and Shanghai have recently launched a share trading link. Earlier on Friday, ahead of the rejection, HKEX boss Li told Reuters that his proposal was one about boosting the long-term fortunes of both exchanges.  �Whoever can come up with a system that either allows money to go into China or allow the Chinese money to come out is going to really, really transform global financial markets.� Additional reporting by Jennifer Hughes in Hong Kong, and Clara Denina, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Carolyn Cohn in London; Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Pravin Char",https://in.reuters.com/article/lse-m-a-hkexlse/london-stock-exchange-rejects-hong-kongs-39-bln-takeover-offer-idINKCN1VY1A2?il=0&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1596,Delhi Police investigates Budweiser owner in tax evasion case,Delhi Police is investigating a case of alleged tax evasion involving Budweiser owner AB InBev after receiving a request from the Delhi government. Local authorities barred AB InBev in July from selling its beer in Delhi for three years over alleged tax evasion. Delhi Police said it would conduct its own probe before registering a formal case.,Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in India�s capital New Delhi are probing a case of alleged tax evasion involving Anheuser-Busch InBev, according to a police officer and a document seen by Reuters, a setback for the brewer already battling a three-year city ban. Local authorities barred AB InBev, the world�s largest brewer, in July from selling its beer in the high profile New Delhi market for evading taxes. The company has denied the allegations and appealed the order. The Delhi ban followed an investigation by city authorities which found that beer maker SABMiller - acquired by AB InBev in 2016 for around $100 billion - used duplicate barcodes on its beer bottles supplied to city retailers that year, allowing it to pay lower taxes. The Delhi government�s ban order had also called for further action against the company and a local bar outlet for alleged violation of criminal law provisions such as conspiracy, cheating and forgery. A senior Delhi police official, Anant Kumar Gunjan, told Reuters that officers have launched an investigation into the case after receiving a request from the city government, a move that could potentially lead to criminal charges.  �We are investigating this, it is under inquiry,� said Gunjan, adding that police would conduct its own probe before registering a formal case. AB InBev told Reuters in a statement on Friday that it was aware of the �potential for an additional authority to take interest in allegations� raised in the Delhi government�s ban order.  �It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time. We are committed to operating with integrity and high ethical standards,� a spokesman said, adding that the allegations dated back to 2016, before its takeover of SABMiller. News of the police investigation will add to the company�s woes in New Delhi, where it is already arguing against the ban order with city authorities and in court. Separately, AB InBev is also battling an Indian antitrust watchdog investigation concerning alleged beer price-fixing by SABMiller and others. �The ban only has a financial impact, the police case could be a much bigger headache for the company and can have wider ramifications,� said Sandeep Chilana, a New Delhi-based lawyer specializing in taxation and liquor laws. The Delhi administration made a written request to police authorities last month to register a case, according to a government document dated Sept. 6, seen by Reuters on Friday.  �Considering the gravity of the offence, it is opined that even a harsher and exemplary punishment (than the ban) ... would have also been justified in this case,� the document said.   AB InBev, which sells popular beer brands such as Budweiser and Hoegaarden, is the second biggest player in India�s $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5% market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.

""I eat a lot...My mum likes to feed me...I haven't had as many roasts at home in last six months,"" said Marsh, who's playing a Test after eight months. ""I...worked my arse off...to get another opportunity,"" he added.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - All-rounder Mitchell Marsh is acutely aware he polarises Australian cricket fans but hopes forgoing his mum�s roast dinners as part of a new fitness regime might help win their respect. Marsh celebrated his recall to the side for the first time since last year�s Boxing Day test against India by taking 4-35 as Australia turned the screws on England in the fifth and final Ashes test at the Oval on Thursday. The hosts were 271-8 at stumps on day one after Jos Buttler�s unbeaten 64 rescued their innings. Having been in the team�s leadership group last year before he was dumped and lost his central contract, Marsh acknowledged his see-sawing form had made it difficult for home fans to warm to him. �Yeah, most of Australia hate me,� Marsh said before laughing. �Australians are very passionate, they love their cricket, they want people to do well.  �There�s no doubt I�ve had a lot of opportunity at test level and I haven�t quite nailed it,� added Marsh, who averaged 25.39 with the bat and 43.91 with the ball from his 31 previous tests. �But hopefully they can respect me for the fact I keep coming back and I love playing for Australia, I love the baggy green cap and I�ll keep trying and hopefully I�ll win them over one day.� The 27-year-old said there were times after he lost his central contract when he doubted he would be back in the Australian side. Personal issues had also affected him in the last year, including the suicide of a close friend, while his fitness and strength were also lacking, something that coach Justin Langer had asked him to work on. �Over the last six months I have put everything I�ve had in to it and I�ve changed my lifestyle a bit,� he said. �I don�t eat badly. I just eat a lot. My body just likes to put on weight easily and my mum likes to feed me. �I haven�t had as many roasts at home in the last six months, but it hasn�t been that hard. �There has been no secret recipe, I just worked my arse off hoping to get another opportunity.� Australia retained the Ashes with victory in the fourth test at Old Trafford and lead the series 2-1.

1602,Huawei offers to license 5G technologies to Western firms,"China's Huawei has offered to share its 5G technologies with Western firms to ease the security concerns raised by the US. CEO Ren Zhengfei said Huawei would give companies ""perpetual access"" to its existing 5G patents, codes and technical blueprints for a one-time fee. This would create more 5G players and a balance between China and the West, Zhengfei added.",Engadget,"Huawei's CEO Ren Zhengfei said the company is willing to help boost a western rival in the global 5G race as a way to ease tensions with the West. In a recent interview, Ren told The Economist Huawei would give another company ""perpetual access"" to its existing 5G patents, code and technical blueprints in return for a one-time fee.Ren went on to claim the license would give the buyer the freedom to modify Huawei's source code, so as to address any possible spying concerns. The potential cybersecurity threat Huawei presents to western nations has been a contentious issue among the Five Eyes, an intelligence-sharing alliance that is made up of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US. While Australia, New Zealand and the US have banned their respective national carriers from buying 5G equipment from Huawei, Canada and UK have yet to do the same. As part of this hypothetical deal, Huawei would keep all of its existing carrier contracts and continue to develop new 5G tech, as well as work to secure new sales contracts. Essentially, the company wants to reset the playing field and go from there.However, as The Economist notes, it's hard to say whether the plan is likely to work. First, it's unclear if the Chinese government would agree to Huawei essentially selling off a portion of its most valuable assets to a foreign company. Similarly, it's uncertain if there's a company out there that is actually interested in buying Huawei's 5G patents.Most of all, even if Huawei were to prop up a western rival, it's unlikely that would put the company in the US government's good books. As things currently stand, there are few things Democrats and Republicans agree on, but both mistrust Huawei. In July, a bipartisan group of House representatives and senators moved to block the Trump Administration from removing Huawei from the Commerce Department Entity List.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/12/huawei-boss-willing-license-5g-tech-ease-spying-fears/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The upcoming regulations for ride-hailing platforms will also address passenger safety issues and types of vehicles allowed. This follows the new motor vehicle law recognising cab aggregators as marketplaces for the first time.",Entrackr,"Union government is in the midst of framing new guidelines for cab aggregator platforms addressing several issues, including the dynamic pricing of cab fares during peak hours.The government will likely allow surge pricing up to 3X in the new policy regulating the cab operators. Both industry leaders, Uber and Ola, have been rebuked by Indian Courts in the past for irrational pricing.Delhi High Court had banned the practice of surge pricing by app-based taxi aggregators in the national capital region in 2016.Customers, who have often complained of irregularities in cab prices will not be pleased by the new regulations as it will allow the ride-hailing services to charge as much as three times the regular fares.However, the cab aggregators have been defending the practice citing demand and supply issues and monetising the increased demands during periods of peak demand for cabs.The new regulations will also accommodate rules according to the new Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019. The recently implemented law has finally recognised cab aggregators by creating a new category for them.Companies like Ola, Uber and Rapido who have been operating in the grey area due to lack of official norms will now be recognised as online intermediaries or marketplaces, which can be used by passengers to connect with a driver for transportation.The proposed guidelines will also address the issues of passenger security, types of vehicles allowed and liability responsibility as provided in the new motor vehicle act. Supreme Court in July had asked the central government to draft a new law to regulate mobile app-based taxi service providers and address safety issues, particularly for women riders.The new framework will be enforceable across India, but the state governments will be allowed to make changes as per the needs of that particular state.In previous cases, states such as Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have banned the operations of bike taxis while Karnataka had implemented its own rules regarding surge prices.The development was reported by ET.",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/govt-uber-ola-cap-surge-prices-max-3x/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1607,New cancer treatment prevents hair loss from chemotherapy,Researchers at The University of Manchester claim to have found a way to prevent hair loss in cancer patients during chemotherapy. Researchers found that coating the hair follicles with CDK4/6 inhibitors may prevent hair loss. Researchers have claimed that as many as 8% of patients may refuse chemotherapy due to the 'psychological burden' of hair loss.,Times Now,"London:�A novel method discovered recently by a group of researchers, including one of Indian-origin, shows how hair loss from chemotherapy can be prevented during cancer treatment in patients, arguably one of the most psychologically distressing side effects of modern cancer therapy. The study published in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine describes how damage to the hair follicles caused by taxanes, cancer drugs which can cause permanent hair loss, can be prevented.

To do this, the research team has exploited the properties of a newer class of drugs called CDK4/6 inhibitors, which block cell division and are already medically approved as so-called ""targeted"" cancer therapies.

""Although at first, this seems counterintuitive, we found that CDK4/6 inhibitors can be used temporarily to halt cell division without promoting additional toxic effects in the hair follicle. When we bathed organ-cultured human scalp hair follicles in CDK4/6 inhibitors, the hair follicles were much less susceptible to the damaging effects of taxanes,"" study lead author Talveen Purba from the University of Manchester said.

Taxanes are very important anti-cancer drugs commonly used to treat, for example, patients with breast or lung carcinoma and particularly cause anxieties among breast cancer patients for the very distressing and sometimes long-lasting hair loss taxanes can induce.

""A pivotal part of our study was to first get to grips with how exactly hair follicles responded to taxane chemotherapy, and we found that the specialised dividing cells at the base of the hair follicle that are critical for producing hair itself, and the stem cells from which they arise, are most vulnerable to taxanes.

""Therefore, we must protect these cells most from undesired chemotherapy effects -- but so that cancer does not profit from it,"" Purba said.

The researchers underscore that more work is desperately needed in this lamentably under-funded field of cancer medicine, where patients have waited for so long to see real breakthroughs in pharmacological hair loss prevention.

The 31-year-old dropped to the ground after getting hit post missing a pull shot on the bowling of Hardus Viljoen. He was rushed to hospital, where he was cleared of any serious injury.",CricTracker,"Caribbean Premier League (CPL) that was started back in 2013 has witnessed lots and lots of big moments during its reign and it is currently in its 6th successive season. On Thursday though every fan witnessed a terrifying incident in a match between Jamaica Tallawahs and St Lucia Zouks. It took away the breath of everyone while Andre Russell was batting.The incident took place in the 14th over of the match. Russell till then had faced 2 balls and was still waiting for his account of runs to get opened. On the 5th delivery of the over, the West Indies all-rounder failed to connect the short ball bowled by Hardus Viljoen which struck on his helmet near the right ear.AdvertisementIt appeared that there was no neck guard on the batsman�s helmet and the impact was so bad that he fell on the field at the very moment. After this, all the Zouks fielders then came to remove his helmet and Russell was then taken for the scan. In the meantime, physio was seen on the ground for medical assistance.Andre Russell rather got up soon after getting hit but fell on the ground again which increased concerns among fans and the players. The sight at that moment looked quite scary. It gave a flashback of an incident that took place in 2014 where the Australian Cricketer Phil Hughes passed away due to a severe bouncer which struck his head near the right ear exactly where Russell got hit.After the blow, the West Indies all-rounder was stretchered off the field. Later, in a medical update, the franchise confirmed that the star all-rounder hadn�t suffered a serious injury and is likely to be ruled out of the action for the next two days.Currently, Jamaica Tallawahs are on the last position with 3 direct losses in 3 matches which puts them in a tough situation. They are struggling to finish the drought of win.

Such attempts have not succeeded earlier and will not succeed now,"" First Secretary in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN Sandeep Kumar Bayyapu said Thursday.""The truth is that the delegation represents a geographical space that is now widely known as the hub of terrorism that has jeopardised innocent lives in our region and beyond. We do not wish to dignify such baseless diatribes with a response,"" he said.On the report of the Security Council, Bayyapu asserted that many of the flaws in the functioning of the Council were structural and its composition is demonstrably out of touch with the ground realities.""The Council neither reflects nor represents the aspirations and views of the larger membership. Like most others, we remain convinced that the only remedy is a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, involving expansion in its permanent and non-permanent categories,"" he said.Bayyapu said that since performance assessment has become one of the focus areas at the United Nations, the Security Council too needs to prove its credibility and improve its performance.The annual report continues to be a statistical compilation of events, a bland summary and listing of meetings and outcome documents even though the membership of the General Assembly has repeatedly requested the Council that the annual report be more analytical and incisive rather than a mere narration of the meetings of the 15-nation organ of the UN, he said.""The debate on the annual report has become a ritual and a formality in a long list of formalities. There is a need to reinvigorate this interaction between the most representative organ of the United Nations and its most empowered brethren,"" he said.He stressed that the annual report of the Security Council must inform, highlight and analyse the measures that it has decided upon or taken to maintain international peace and security during the reporting period.Bayyapu also voiced concern that the report was not only lacking in substance but is submitted late in the year, almost towards the last quarter of the next year due to which it does not generate the attention needed for a proper discussion.""This needs to be rectified. There should be definite timelines for completing the report, circulating to wider GA members and holding the debate earlier not towards the close of the session,"" he said.The 74th session of the General Assembly will begin next week and the annual high-level session will begin soon thereafter.Bayyapu expressed disappointment that the annual report of the Security Council is short of analysis on the UN peacekeeping operations, the flagship tool for the maintenance of international peace and security.""There is little information on how peacekeeping operations are run, on the problems they face, on why certain mandates are set or changed, or on when and why they are strengthened, scaled-down or ended,"" he said.He stressed that a better partnership between the Security Council and the Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) is needed given that most peacekeepers are contributed by non-Council members, who put the lives of their troops at risk to serve the cause of international peace.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/pakistan-hub-of-terrorism-says-india-at-un-slams-islamabad-for-spreading-deceitful-narratives-on-kashmir/487977?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1624,Ex-Zimbabwe Prez Mugabe to be buried at heroes monument,"Former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe will be buried at the country's National Heroes Acre. The official ceremony would be followed by a private family event at the monument for heroes of the liberation war against white minority rule. Mugabe's body arrived in Zimbabwe from Singapore on Wednesday. Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years, died at the age of 95.",Reuters,"HARARE (Reuters) - Robert Mugabe will be buried at a Zimbabwean national shrine in Harare in about 30 days, his nephew said on Friday, contradicting comments earlier in the day that the burial will be on Sunday. Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years until he was ousted by his own army in November 2017, died in a Singapore hospital a week ago aged 95. A fight over his burial place has threatened to undermine his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe�s former deputy who conspired to topple him, and expose deep rifts in the governing ZANU-PF party. [L5N2605BI] �The government and the chiefs went to the Heroes Acre, showed each other where President Mugabe is going to be buried, and that place would take about 30 days to complete,� said Leo Mugabe, a nephew of the former president who has acted as a spokesman for the family. �So what that means is the burial will take that long,� he said. Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party have wanted Mugabe buried at a national monument to heroes of the liberation war against white minority rule. Such a ceremony could give Mnangagwa a chance to show that the party is united behind his political and economic agenda. But some relatives, expressing bitterness at the way former comrades including Mnangagwa had ousted Mugabe, had pushed for him to be buried in his home village rather than at the shrine. Mugabe�s body will be preserved until the burial, Leo Mugabe said. Asked whether a mausoleum or similar structure would be built for Mugabe, the nephew said: �Yes, something like that�, also disclosing that the burial site will not be next to the one of the former president�s first wife Sally, who died in 1992. �It�s a totally different site,� he said. Mugabe�s body arrived in Zimbabwe from Singapore on Wednesday and started three days of lying in state on Thursday. Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo told Reuters that the confusion over Mugabe�s burial place had arisen because the government could reach an agreement with close family members only once they returned to Zimbabwe with the body. He said it was fitting for Mugabe to be interred at National Heroes Acre because it �symbolizes the greatest honor one can be bestowed with and it can only be a place where men and women who have contributed to the liberation of this country...can be buried.� During his near four-decades rule, Mugabe used his powers to bestow or deny former comrades the privilege to be buried at National Heroes Acre. Mugabe�s body was displayed for a second day on Friday at Rufaro soccer stadium in Harare�s Mbare township, where thousands of mourners filed past the open coffin. Foreign dignitaries were due to start arriving in Harare on Friday ahead of a state funeral planned for the country�s National Sports Stadium on Saturday. Heads of state expected to attend the funeral include South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Kenya�s Uhuru Kenyatta.

1625,"US, China tariffs could lower global GDP by 0.8% in 2020: IMF","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday said that tariffs imposed or proposed by the US and China could lower global economic output by 0.8% in 2020. The impact of the US-China trade war and other trade disputes is now being felt, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said. He added that the tariffs could trigger additional losses in future years.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tariffs imposed or threatened by the United States and China could shave 0.8% off global economic output in 2020 and trigger more losses in future years, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said trade tensions were beginning to affect a world economy already facing challenges including a weakening of manufacturing activity not seen since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters he had not seen the new IMF forecast, but did not expect the impact to be as significant in the United States. �I don�t see it in U.S. as that big an impact,� he said, when asked about the IMF forecast after an event hosted by the New York Times. Rice told a regularly scheduled IMF news conference that the global lender is to release a new revised economic outlook next month, but provided no details.  World economic activity remained subdued, with trade and geopolitical tensions causing uncertainty and eroding business confidence, investment and trade, he said. The IMF had previously forecast that the U.S.-China trade war and other trade disputes threatened future global growth, but Rice said the impact was now being felt. �Trade tensions .... are not only a threat, but are actually beginning to weigh down the dynamism in the global economy,� he said, adding U.S.-China tariffs �could potentially reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8% in 2020, with additional losses in future years.� That forecast is more gloomy than one earlier this year, when the IMF said tariffs already imposed and those planned could shave 0.5% off global economic output in 2020. Mark Hamrick, economic analyst at Bankrate, a New York-based consumer financial services company, said the new forecast reflected skepticism that Washington and Beijing would end the trade war. �Trade tensions have only grown. There is no agreement that is in sight,� Hamrick said, noting that growing concerns in the business sector were starting to bleed into consumer sentiment. Hamrick said the IMF assessment could fuel concerns about a U.S. recession after 11 years of expansion. Economists polled by Bankrate see a 41% chance of a recession by the time of the November 2020 presidential election, he said. Asked if the IMF anticipates a global recession, Rice said that was not in the fund�s baseline at the moment. He noted that the IMF had used words such as �very precarious,� �very fragile,� and �delicate� to describe the economic outlook. �Let�s not get ahead of ourselves. Let�s wait and see,� he said, noting the forthcoming world economic outlook would  provide greater clarity.  Rice stressed he was not hinting that the IMF planned to forecast a recession. The global lender this week unveiled a new �World Trade Uncertainty� index for 143 countries based on its country reports, using data back to 1996.  In the past year, the index jumped 10-fold from previous high in the wake of escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, it said.

It is about a Frenchman who died during sex while on a business trip and a court ruled it a ""workplace accident"".In the uncanny judgement, a Paris court ruled that the firm should payout to the family of its employee who suffered a heart attack during sex while he was on a business trip for a railway company, reported Fox News.A Frenchman identified as M. Xavier had travelled to the Loiret region in 2013 for his employer TSO, a railway construction company where he had sex with a 'complete strangerDuring the act, the man suffered a heart attack and died, The Local France reported, citing local media.

Also, the man died in a different hotel, his death was not a liability of the company.The company said before the ruling that the employee's death ""occurred when he had knowingly interrupted his work for a reason solely dictated by his personal interest, independent of his employment"" and that because of this, he was no longer on his business trip.The company also went on to add that its employee's death did not have anything to do with his work performance but rather a ""sexual act he had with a complete stranger.""However, the Paris court argued that it does not matter whether an accident during a business trip happens on work or personal time unless an employer has proof an employee ""interrupted his mission"" for personal reasons.

This has been proposed under gun law reforms following the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch in March. The bill also proposed gun licences in New Zealand be renewed every five years instead of every 10 years.,The New Indian Express,"WELLINGTON:�New Zealand unveiled new legislation Friday aimed at ensuring only ""fit and proper"" people can own guns in the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks that killed 51 Muslim worshippers.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had immediately banned military-style semi-automatic rifles after the shootings in March but said further restrictions were needed to target the black market.""Owning a firearm is a privilege not a right,"" she told reporters in Christchurch on Friday.""That means we need to do all we can to ensure that only honest, law-abiding citizens are able to obtain firearms licences and use firearms.""Under the new legislation, a registry will be set up that is designed to track ownership of every legally owned firearm in the country.The measure also increases the jail term for supplying firearms to an unlicensed person from three months to two years, as well as tightening gun importation and sales.ALSO READ:�New Zealand moves mosque shooting trial to avoid clash with RamadanPolice will determine if someone is ""fit and proper"" to hold a licence, with power to exclude anyone promoting extremism, convicted of violent crime or with mental health issues, including attempted suicide.The register, expected to take five years to complete, will contain details of the estimated 1.2 million firearms in New Zealand, for a population of around five million.Police Minister Stuart Nash said the existing gun legislation was introduced in 1983 and needed updating.The alleged Christchurch gunman Brenton Tarrant legally obtained an arsenal of rifles before embarking on the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's modern history.The self-avowed white supremacist is accused of opening fire at two mosques while live streaming his actions on social media.He has pleaded not guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 of attempted murder and engaging in a terrorist act.In addition to the semi-automatic ban, the first round of gun law reforms included a firearms buyback scheme allowing the public to hand in weapons before a six-month amnesty expires.The Christchurch killings rocked New Zealand and Ardern's gun reforms have been generally accepted in the South Pacific nation.There has been some opposition, including from the conservative ACT Party, which said law-abiding firearms owners were not receiving a fair hearing.""We also oppose a gun register because such an exercise will cost a significant sum of taxpayer money but will not capture the criminals and gang members who hold firearms,"" ACT leader David Seymour said.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/sep/13/new-zealand-tightens-gun-laws-again-after-mosque-massacre-2033037.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

In the past 18 years, Saudi Arabia has denied any involvement in the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Two Saudi officials, Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy, had previously been named.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday said it would release the name of an individual sought by people who are suing the government of Saudi Arabia for alleged involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacking attacks.  U.S. prosecutors in New York said in a court filing that Attorney General William Barr had decided not to invoke state secrets and will share the person�s name with attorneys involved in the case. The decision could help victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and their family members, who charge in a long-running lawsuit that the Saudi government supported the hijackers who crashed jet liners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, killing nearly 3,000 people. The Saudi government has repeatedly denied involvement in the attacks. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.  The case, filed in 2003, received a boost in 2016 when Congress passed a law making it easier to sue foreign governments for alleged involvement in terrorism. The plaintiffs have been trying to obtain redacted material from a 2012 FBI report which indicated the agency was investigating two Saudi officials, Omar al-Bayoumi and Fahad al-Thumairy, and said there was evidence that a third, unnamed party had ordered them to help the hijackers. Attorneys will now get to learn the name of that person, though their identity will remain under seal. �The Saudis are running out of rope,� said Don Milgiori and Sean Carter, two attorneys involved in the case. �We look forward to more disclosures in the weeks and months ahead,� they said in a prepared statement.

1661,World's first malaria vaccine to be introduced in Kenya,"The world's first malaria vaccine is being rolled out in parts of Kenya after debuting in Ghana and Malawi earlier this year. More than 300,000 children are expected to receive the vaccine over the next three years. Malaria infected about 219 million people in 2017, killing around 435,000 of them, most of them babies and children in parts of Africa.",Reuters,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya on Friday began adding a malaria vaccine to its routine immunization schedule for babies and toddlers, becoming the third African country to roll out the vaccine for a disease that threatens children across the continent. Malaria, which kills one child globally every two minutes, is the top killer of children under five in the east African country. The vaccine - the world�s first against malaria - will be administered to children under two and could be crucial to efforts to combat the disease, health officials said. Other measures, such as nets to protect people from the mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite, have not proven adequate to halt transmission, the director general of Kenya�s health ministry, Wekesa Masasabi, told Reuters. �We still have an incidence of 27% (malaria infection) for children under five,� Masasabi said before Friday�s launch of the vaccine in the western county of Homa Bay.  The Homa Bay programme is the government�s first step toward creating awareness of the new vaccine, he said.  The injectable vaccine, called RTS,S or Mosquirix, was developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline to protect children from the most deadly form of malaria in Africa. In clinical trials it proved only partially effective and it needs to be given in a four-dose schedule, but it is the first regulator-approved vaccine against the disease. It has already been deployed in pilot programmes in Ghana and Malawi.  Malaria infected about 219 million people in 2017 and killed around 435,000. The vast majority of malaria deaths are among babies and children in the poorest parts of Africa. Due to ongoing transmission, half the world�s population is still at risk of contracting the disease.  The World Health Organization�s regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, said the Kenyan, Ghanaian and Malawian pilots would provide key information and data for a future WHO policy on broader use of the vaccine in sub-Saharan Africa.  A recent surge in malaria cases and deaths in the region is threatening gains in the fight against the disease, she said, adding that the vaccine �has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives.� Kenya plans to roll out RTS,S to eight of its 47 counties over the next two years, Masasabi said.  In a major report published last weekend, global health experts said malaria could be eradicated within a generation with the right tools, funding and political will.  Commissioned by The Lancet medical journal, the report contradicted the conclusions last month of a malaria review by the WHO. The experts urged the U.N. agency not to shy away from this �goal of epic proportions�.

This time the Aam Aadmi Party will implement the scheme from November 4-15.�CM Arvind Kejriwal announced a seven-point action plan �Parali Pradushan� ahead of a period of peak pollution and crop burning in the neighbouring states. The decision may be viewed as the government�s initiative to strike a connect with voters ahead of Assembly polls.
The scheme has been both a challenge and a channel for the government to fight the alarming pollution in Delhi. Even after huge criticism over its earlier attempts, the government is adamant in proving its efficacy in a third attempt.The CM said studies have shown that the scheme had reduced air pollution in Delhi by 10-13%, a claim that has been contested by many scientists. Even opposition leaders did not agree with the scheme.�
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari stressed that the rationing scheme was not needed and that Delhi would be pollution-free in the next two years. Gadkari, who inaugurated a CNG centre at Nagpur, said, �There is no such need (odd-even scheme) because the new ring road we�ve built is helping reduce pollution in Delhi to a certain extent.��However, Kejriwal said, �Pollution has started to reduce and Delhi seems to be the only city in the entire country where this positive development has begun. We don�t have to sit back and relax with 25% reduction..It should be reduced till it comes to the good range...10 or 11 months of the year. Delhi�s air has seen a marked improvement. But every November, because of the smoke that comes from Punjab and Haryana, Delhi turns into a gas chamber. The Centre and these states are trying to prevent this from happening. But until that happens, we must take steps to protect ourselves from the toxic air created due to crop burning,� Kejriwal said.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2019/sep/13/odd-even-rule-to-be-implemented-in-delhi-from-november-4-15-arvind-kejriwal-2033047.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The product is in alpha stage and being tested continuously. Group dining, whether organised office parties or family outings, is a valuable large-table opportunity. The very focus of infinity was to enable more of these opportunities for restaurants. We received a range of feedback about the service, and have paused it as we incorporate the feedback,� a Zomato spokesperson told TNM.The Infinity Dining program was launched for members of Zomato Gold, who would have access to a few restaurants which gave them all-you-can-eat or drink offers at specific restaurants in the city at a fixed price.Zomato had said that Gold members can book tickets for their friends and family, and children up to the age of six can dine for free when accompanied by an adult availing Infinity. They had it made it available in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi.�Zomato's attempt to sell the Infinity feature in the gold program broke the final straw.

1688,Google to shut down shopping service 'Express' in next few weeks,"Google, which had earlier announced the shutdown of its US shopping service Google Express, in emails sent to users revealed that it will be closed in a few weeks. The features and functions of Express will be integrated into Google's new, global 'Shopping' platform. The Google Express apps will automatically update to become Google Shopping if already installed by users.",TechCrunch,"Google�s  failed online shopping service Google Express is closing in a few weeks, as its features will be merged into a revamped version of Google Shopping, Google says in an email sent to its customers this week. The company had already announced its plans to shutter the Google Express brand, as part of a wider redesign of how it approached online shopping. This included new advertising options for brands and online sellers, as well as a universal shopping cart across its platform of services, like Search, Shopping, Images, and even YouTube.While Google is characterizing Google Express�s closure as an �integration,� it�s really more of a sunsetting of a failed brand.Google Express was Google�s high-profile attempt to compete with Amazon for online shopping clicks and ad dollars buy creating a virtual mall on the web filled with top retailers� products. Because Google is not a retailer itself, it did what it knows best � it organized information. At Google Express, you could find products from thousands of retailers � including big names like Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Best Buy, and others. And you could shop through a dedicated online storefront on the web, a Google Express mobile app, or even Google Assistant.In the latter case, Google Express partnered with retailers like Walmart and Target for deep integrations for voice-enabled shopping. As direct competitors with Amazon, these retailers didn�t want to offer third-party skills for Echo users or others on Amazon�s Alexa platform. Google represented a safer third-party platform for their experiments with voice commands and personalized shopping.But even several years after launch, Google Express had failed to offer any real threat to Amazon. Its retail partners, meanwhile, were building out their own fulfillment businesses for their customers� online orders � like Walmart Grocery�s curbside pickup and delivery, for example, or Target�s Shipt, Drive Up, and Restock.Not too much later, Target and Walmart were pulling out or pulling back from Google Express, it was being reported. (Target says it continues to invest in the platform. Gizmodo had previously reported on how Target reshaped its relationship with Google Express after launch.)Google tried to downplay the news of Google Express�s demise by including it as just another part to the larger Google Shopping revamp. After all, it�s not a shutdown, the company implied. Its features were simply becoming a part of Google Shopping! Nothing to see here! Just a rebrand!But clearly, Google Express had been unable to establish itself in consumers� minds as its own dedicated shopping destination and brand. If customers wanted an online mall, they already had one with either Amazon or Walmart and their vast third-party marketplaces where you could find just about anything you�d need. Nor had Google innovated (or acquired) across key areas like warehousing or logistics, while others like Amazon, Target, and Walmart had been spending billions.With Google Shopping, Google goes back to its search engine roots. It aims to simply capture consumers� clicks, ad dollars and now conversions no matter where they are on Google�s sites � whether that�s shopping from Merch shelves under YouTube videos, browsing photos in a Pinterest-y manner on Google Images, or through more traditional Google searches for products where ads become shoppable, and shopping carts follow you around Google�s part of the web.In an email to Google Express shoppers that was sent this week, Google says Google Express will be integrated with Shopping in a few weeks� time.The redesigned Google Shopping will then be available across the web and through apps for iOS and Android later this month. At that point, the Google Express apps will automatically update to become Google Shopping, if you already had them installed.The full email about Google Express� closure is below:�As expected, Google disputed the Google Express brand�s demise as a �shutdown.��Google�Express is now�Google�Shopping. The same stores and products, free delivery options, and easy checkout offered by�Google�Express will now be available through �Buy with�Google� across surfaces,� a spokesperson said.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/11/google-express-to-close-in-a-few-weeks-will-become-part-of-google-shopping/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Subhasri, who was riding a two-wheeler, lost her balance and fell on the road. Eyewitnesses said that a tanker lorry coming from behind ran over her.",The News Minute,"Outside the mortuary of the Chromepet General Hospital in Chennai, a small crowd of youngsters were in shock, a few struggling to hold back their tears. They were friends of Subhasri Ravi, a 23-year-old techie who was killed around 2.30pm on Thursday at Palliakarani, on the 200-feet Radial stretch along the Thuraipakkam- Pallavaram road.Subhasri had been riding her two-wheeler when a hoarding erected on the road�s divider fell on her. Subhasri lost her balance, and as the bike veered off, she fell on the middle of the road. Eyewitnesses told the media that though the driver of a tanker lorry that had been coming from behind tried to apply brake, it rammed into the young woman. Though she was rushed to the Chromepet GH, she died within an hour.�The hoardings had been erected on either sides of the road and on the divider by former AIADMK Councillor and Kancheepuram East MGR Mandram Assistant Secretary S Jayagopal to announce his son�s wedding. A high-profile wedding that saw even Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam attending it.An eyewitness Manimaran told the media, ""One hoarding was already coming loose and I went and tied it. The banner fell on her and she slipped. Though the lorry tried to swerve and stop, the driver could not. Most of the banners were loose and crooked.""
	The accident spotSubhasri who has become the latest victim of political apathy was an B.Tech graduate who was working in an IT company in Perungudi. The 23-year-old was reportedly returning home from her office. She was also planning on going to Canada in October to pursue her higher studies.�St Thomas Mount Traffic Investigation Wing has arrested the lorry driver and filed a case against him. A case has been filed against Manoj, the driver who hails from Bihar, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including section 279 (rash driving), section 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others), and section 304A (causing death by negligence).Though the police station has been tightlipped about the details, sources say that no case has been filed against Jayagopal till Thursday night. ""We have filed a case against the person who put up the hoarding. We are not sure who it was outsourced to. If they had sought permission for it, the Revenue department will have the details. We will add names of the person who put it up and who gave order after investigation,"" Inspector Ravikumar of the St Thomas Mount station told TN.Despite multiple bans and High Court warnings, many politicians and political parties continue to erect hoardings and put up banners for every small event they are associated with. Though people are allowed to erect banners and hoarding after seeking police permission two weeks before, the High Court has repeatedly said that flex banners and hoardings of living persons cannot be put up. Moreover, rules dictate that the letters granting permission from the corporation be displayed on these banners.The AIADMK in particular is one of the biggest defaulters and despite being the ruling party, it has given scant regard to the court�s repeated orders. In November 2017, K Ragupathi, a software engineer from the US who had returned home to Coimbatore to meet a prospective bride, was killed after he rammed into an illegal wooden arch erected for MGR Centenary celebrations.�

""(Smith) will be a better leader next time around because of the very harsh lessons he learnt,"" the 54-year-old added. ""I don't believe the additional responsibility of captaincy would affect his batting,"" Taylor further said.",Cricket Country,"Former skipper Mark Taylor on Thursday backed Steve Smith to captain Australia again after his incredible Ashes exploits, as support mounts for the 30-year-old to be given a second chance. Smith was banned for 12 months over a brazen attempt to alter the ball with sandpaper under his captaincy in a Cape Town Test, and slapped with a further year�s suspension from any leadership role which runs out at the end of March next year.ASHES 2019 FULL SCHEDULE | ASHES 2019 LATEST NEWSWhile wicketkeeper Tim Paine assumed the job in Tests and won praise for the way he helped the side retain the Ashes at Old Trafford last weekend, he will be 35 in December. Usman Khawaja and Travis Head have been touted as potential future leaders, but neither have performed in England while Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood are bowlers, who rarely become captains.Taylor, who helped determine Smith�s ball-tampering penalty, along with the bans handed to David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, said he was the natural choice to take over.�I believe Smith will captain Australia again,� he said in a column for the Sydney Morning Herald. �I was on the Cricket Australia board that determined the penalties for Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft over the events of Cape Town and have no doubt he will be a better leader next time around because of the very harsh lessons he learnt.�Paine was widely criticised for his decision-making in the third Test at Headingley that Australia lost, but he bounced back admirably at Old Trafford and Taylor said he should retain the armband for the upcoming home summer series against Pakistan and New Zealand.But Smith would be waiting in the wings. �To me it�s not a matter of whether he (Smith) becomes captain again on April 1. It doesn�t have to happen that quickly,� he said. �But I�d like to think when Paine is finished as Test captain � whether that�s in six months� time or two or three years � he would be a candidate to lead the side again.�Another ex-captain, Ian Chappell, has also backed Smith to again assume the role. �I think the problem for Australia will be there�s no one else I can see to captain that side,� he said recently, while Ricky Ponting stated he �wouldn�t have any problem with it at all�.�If the hierarchy at Cricket Australia have an issue with him ever being captain again, they would have given him a life ban, wouldn�t they?� Ponting said last month.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/i-believe-steve-smith-will-captain-australia-again-mark-taylor-890500?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1705,Scientists create colour-changing smart skin inspired by chameleons,"Scientists have created a flexible smart skin that can change colour in response to the environment without changing shape. It was created by studying time-lapse videos of chameleons' phase-shifting skin and experiment with embedding photonic crystal arrays into flexible, water-containing polymers. Expanding or contracting the hydrogel changed the spacing in the arrays, leading to colour change.",Engadget,"Color-changing smart skin is nothing new, but scientists have had a hard time working out the kinks. Current smart skin is fragile and buckles after being exposed to varying temperatures. To help remedy that problem, scientists turned to analyzing detailed videos of chameleons' skin. This helped them develop a far more resilient take on this tech, which shows a more promising future for color-changing gear.Chameleons can change their colors thanks to photonic crystals in their skin. As they tense or relax their muscles, the light reflects in a different pattern, resulting in a change of color. The problem with synthetic color-changing skin is in the hydrogel that the photonic crystals are packed into: After expanding and contracting, the large amount of crystals would cause the medium to seize up. Khalid Salaita and his colleagues have solved this problem by concluding that less is more.The team watched time-lapse videos of chameleons' phase-shifting skin and realized that the reptiles have fewer skin cells with photonic crystals than previously thought. By packing fewer photonic crystals in a thin layer of hydrogel, and then placing that slice on a larger layer of colorless hydrogel, the smart skin can expand and contract without issue. As the temperature changes or sunlight hits the surface, the material changes color.ACS Nano, a peer-reviewed journal focused on nanotechnology where this study was published, notes that smart skin may have applications in camouflage, signaling and anti-counterfeiting. MIT's color-changing ink, meanwhile, could let users change patterns and colors of their shoes, cars and more. Picking a color for an expensive gadget like a smartphone can be a stressful one; you're going to have to live with that choice for years. But with smart skin, we may eventually be able to change the colors of our gadgets as frequently as we swap out our wallpaper backgrounds.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/12/color-changing-smart-skin-upgrade/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The violence reportedly began to escalate following the collapse of peace talks between the US and Taliban.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber targeted an Afghan Special Forces base in Kabul on Thursday, killing at least four commandos, officials said, as violence continued to escalate following the collapse of peace talks between the United States and Taliban insurgents. The bomber blew up an explosives-laden minibus at the entrance to the camp in Chahar Asyab district, killing the four special forces members and wounding another three, the Defence Ministry said in a statement. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, which he said killed more than 200 commandos. The insurgents routinely issue exaggerated casualty claims. Mujahid said the bomber had been infiltrated into the base well before the attack. The latest attack underscored expectations of an escalation in violence following U.S. President Donald Trump�s sudden cancellation of the talks with the Taliban aimed at withdrawing U.S. troops and ending 18 years of war in Afghanistan. AdvertisementIn Washington, Trump�s nominee to be the secretary of the U.S. Army said walking away from the talks was the correct decision.  �I think that it was the right decision to step back from the table and try to look at how do you get to a framework to bring a political end state to the conflict,� Ryan McCarthy told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.  McCarthy said that he believed that the United States would continue to need not only a counterterrorism capability, but also the ability to advise and assist Afghan security forces. �We can�t take our eye of the ball there until a time where there is a much greater maturity in the strength within the Afghan government,� McCarthy added. Last week, a Taliban suicide blast killed at least 10 civilians and two NATO service members near the U.S. embassy in Kabul. Reporting by Abdul Qadir Sediqi.

1714,"Habibie, Indonesian Prez during transition to democracy, dies","Indonesia's ex-President BJ Habibie, who served during the country's transition to democracy in 1998, passed away aged 83 on Wednesday after suffering from heart failure. Thousands of people reportedly lined the streets as Habibie's cortege moved for a state funeral. Habibie oversaw economic and democratic reforms during 17 months in office, after ex-President Suharto stepped down after 32 years.",Reuters,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thousands of people gathered in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Thursday to mourn the death of former president B.J. Habibie, who came to power as the nation endured a turbulent transition to democracy after former strongman Suharto stepped down in 1998. The 83-year-old Habibie had been suffering heart failure, his son Tariq Kemal Habibie told Metro TV late on Wednesday. People lined the streets as the cortege drove through central Jakarta for the state funeral at the Kalibata Heroes Memorial Park, where President Joko Widodo was set to lead the ceremony.  An engineer by training, Habibie succeeded Suharto as third president of the world�s fourth-largest nation just months after becoming his deputy, as the country sank into spasms of rioting and economic upheaval following the Asian financial crisis.  Taking over from Suharto, who had ruled the world�s most populous Muslim majority country with an iron fist for 32 years, Habibie held power for just 17 months. It fell to Habibie to oversee unpopular economic reforms prescribed by the International Monetary Fund at the height of the financial crisis, that were needed to bring inflation down from more than 80% and stabilize a rupiah currency after its value had crashed. Though he was a product of Suharto�s �New Order� administration, which gave a strong political role to the military and stifled opponents, Habibie oversaw democratic reforms to free political prisoners and allow press freedom. In an abrupt change to longheld policy, he also agreed to a referendum for the people of former Portuguese colony East Timor, which had been annexed in 1976 following an invasion by Indonesian troops in December 1975. The referendum in 1999 resulted in a vote for independence and unleashed a wave of violence.  Habibie also eased discriminatory policies against Indonesia�s ethnic Chinese minority, including allowing the speaking and teaching of Mandarin and use of Chinese names that was previously discouraged by Suharto. He was known for his quest to turn Indonesia into a technological powerhouse, including trying to develop a national aircraft industry. At the hospital shortly after Habibie�s demise, President Widodo described him as �the father of technology in Indonesia.� Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister of neighboring Malaysia, posted his condolences on Twitter and said the death of Habibie was a �big loss.�   The U.S. White House, in a statement, praised Habibie�s �great leadership in preserving Indonesia�s unity.� For many ordinary Indonesians, it was the love story behind Habibie�s marriage to his late wife, Hasri Ainun Habibie, that most touched their hearts, and was celebrated in two popular movies. Ainun died in 2010.  �His love for his wife was legendary,� wrote Kornelius Purba, a senior journalist for the Jakarta Post, in a column on     Thursday. Habibie leaves behind two sons, neither of whom is involved in politics.

However, prospective brides have been rejecting his proposal as he is a constable.

In his resignation letter he said that he was �highly disturbed and depressed with the job� after being rejected by prospective brides, who told him that they didn�t want to marry him due to his job as a constable, which did not have much benefits, had limited growth and long working hours.�As I am a constable one of the marriage proposals was rejected.

1730,China offered oil & gas deal to ignore South China Sea ruling: Duterte,Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said that his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had offered his country a controlling stake in a joint energy deal if he ignored a South China Sea ruling against China. The Permanent Court of Arbitration had in 2016 clarified maritime boundaries and invalidated China's claims to almost the entire South China Sea.,Reuters,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said his Chinese counterpart has offered Manila a controlling stake in a joint energy venture in the South China Sea, if it sets aside an international arbitral award that went against Beijing. Duterte said Chinese President Xi Jinping told him during their recent meeting that if he ignored the Permanent Court of Arbitration�s 2016 ruling, China would agree to be the junior partner in a joint venture to develop gas deposits at the Reed Bank, located within Manila�s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  �Set aside the arbitral ruling,� Duterte was quoted as telling reporters late Tuesday in remarks provided by his office on Wednesday.  �Set aside your claim,� he said, quoting Xi. �Then allow everybody connected with the Chinese companies. They want to explore. If there is something, they said, we will be gracious enough to give you 60%, only 40% will be theirs. That is the promise of Xi Jinping.� Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not give specifics at a briefing on Wednesday on the exchange between the presidents, but said Xi noted that cooperation would yield greater progress in exploiting the sea�s resources.  Hua said Duterte had expressed willingness to hasten maritime oil and gas exploration and development cooperation between China and the Philippines. With regard to some �specific situations,� working groups between the two sides would consult closely, she said. The tribunal in The Hague clarified maritime boundaries and the Philippines� sovereign entitlements, and in doing so, invalidated China�s claims to almost the entire South China Sea. China does not recognize the ruling.  Duterte has sought to befriend Xi, hoping to secure billions of dollars of investment, avoiding challenging China over its activities in the South China Sea, including its militarized artificial islands. Any agreement to forget the arbitral award and team up with China would be a major setback to other claimants, especially Vietnam and Malaysia, which like the Philippines have experienced repeated challenges from China�s coastguard inside their EEZs. The United States has called that bullying and coercion aimed at denying rivals� access to their energy assets. Duterte did not say if he had agreed to Xi�s offer, but said the part of the arbitral award that referred to the EEZ �we will ignore to come up with an economic activity�. The tribunal said the Philippines had legal rights to exploit gas deposits that China also claims at the Reed Bank, about 85 miles (140km) off the Philippine coast. The Philippines only accessible gas resources at the Malampaya fields are set to run out by 2024. A joint project with China has been talked about for decades, but has gone nowhere because of the competing claims. Joint activity could be deemed as legitimizing the other side�s claim, or even relinquishing sovereign rights. Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin on Wednesday told news channel ANC that a preliminary agreement between China and the Philippines would avoid stating which country was entitled to the gas. �It�s very clear - no legal position is compromised if we enter into this agreement,� Locsin said, adding that putting aside the arbitration case was immaterial, because an international court had already made its decision. �It�s final and binding,� he added.

1731,US briefly overtakes Saudi Arabia as world's top oil exporter,"The US briefly overtook Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil exporter in June, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday. Record shale production helped the US ship almost 9 million barrels a day of crude and oil products in June. Saudi reclaimed the top exporter's spot in July and August as hurricanes disrupted US production, the IEA said.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil demand is weathering economic headwinds, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday, buoyed by lower prices brought on by abundant supply as the United States briefly dethroned Saudi Arabia as the world�s top exporter. �With oil prices currently about 20% lower than a year ago, there will be support for consumers,� the IEA said in its monthly report. �Booming shale production has allowed the U.S. to close in on, and briefly overtake, Saudi Arabia as the world�s top oil exporter ... in June, after crude exports surged above 3 million barrels per day (bpd).�  The Paris-based agency maintained its estimate for growth in global oil demand during 2019 at 1.1 million bpd and 1.3 million bpd for next year, assuming no further breakdown in U.S.-China trade talks and citing an easing of tensions around Iran. A rebound in U.S. production following Hurricane Dorian along with steep output growth from Brazil and the North Sea were set to drive production from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) up sharply, it added. U.S. crude exports spiked to more than 3 million bpd in June, as Saudi Arabia cut output sharply and Russia grappled with contamination in one of its main export pipelines. Non-OPEC production growth is seen rising to 2.3 million bpd in 2020, up 400,000 from this year. Meanwhile, demand for OPEC crude is set to reach 28.3 million bpd in the first half of 2020, 1.4 million bpd less than the group produced in August. The discrepancy may prompt OPEC and its allies including Russia to revisit their production-curbing pact. �The implied market balance (will be) returning to a significant surplus and placing pressure on prices,� the IEA said. �The challenge of market management remains a daunting one well into 2020.� Russia, Iraq and Nigeria in August produced 600,000 bpd more than their quotas in the supply pact, the IEA said, but Saudi Arabia cut by more than it had pledged, keeping the overall agreement intact. OPEC member Iran continued to suffer under U.S. sanctions, with exports nearly halving month-on-month in August to just 200,000 bpd. A year earlier, they were at 2.1 million bpd.

But that convenience quickly disintegrates when you drive through tunnels, parking garages or remote areas and lose signal. Amazon wants to fix that. Today, it released version 2.0 of its Alexa Auto SDK, which now comes with a bunch of offline functions.With the new SDK, users can ask Alexa to do things like turn on the AC, tune the radio or make a call -- even when connectivity is intermittent or nonexistent. That's thanks to a ""Local Voice Control"" extension that allows automakers to add a scaled-down version of Alexa's cloud-based service to a vehicle's infotainment system. It acts as a backup and is meant to increase the resiliency of Alexa's cloud-based capabilities.Amazon introduced the Alexa Auto SDK last year, making the tools accessible to all developers via GitHub. Audi, BMW and Toyota have all added Alexa capabilities to their infotainment systems. But not all automakers have signed on. GM recently announced it would bring Google Assistant to Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac. The brand of voice-assistant that automakers choose could become an important selling point. According to a JD Power study conducted for Amazon, 76 percent of respondents said they want the same brand of voice service in both their home and their next vehicle.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/11/alexa-auto-sdk-offline-functions/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The market consensus on the inflation rate was earlier projected at 3.35 per cent. The CPI inflation data released by the government today shows that the rise in prices was mainly driven by the price rise in food items. Food inflation (CFPI) surged to 2.99 per cent in August from 2.36 per cent in July.���With the CPI inflation recording only a mild increase in August 2019 despite the sharp uptick in the food inflation, we continue to expect the MPC to reduce the repo rate by 15-25 bps in the October 2019 policy review, given the continuing concerns related to economic growth,� said Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA.Meanwhile, the industrial production has grown at 4.3 per cent in July 2019, improving substantially from 2 per cent in the previous month.

In a description, Tesla said this Model S is equipped with its ""Plaid powertrain"" (which continues the Spaceballs reference by going a step beyond Ludicrous) and a chassis prototype.In 2016, Musk tweeted that Plaid would be reserved for the upcoming Roadster, so it appears that plans have changed.

The bodyguard bound the worker's hands, kicked him and forced him to kiss her feet. She allegedly got angry when she saw the worker filming her on his phone.",Reuters,"PARIS (Reuters) - The daughter of the King of Saudi Arabia was complicit in beating up and briefly kidnapping a workman in her luxury flat Paris, a French court ruled on Thursday, sentencing the princess to a 10-month suspended prison sentence. Speaking after the verdict, Princess Hassa bint Salman�s French lawyer said most of the declarations made by workman Ashraf Eid were false and that an appeal would be lodged.  According to the initial indictment, Ashraf Eid told police that the princess� bodyguard bound his hands, punched and kicked him and forced him to kiss the princess� feet after she accused him of filming her on his cell phone. He told investigators his phone was forcibly taken from him and that as he was being beaten, Princess Hassa had treated him like a dog, telling him �you�ll see how you speak to a princess, how you speak to the royal family.� Defence lawyer Emmanuel Moyne disputed the court�s conclusions. �There was no theft and moreover there was no violence. All the investigators� findings, the medical certificates demonstrate that the accusations made by Mr Eid are fanciful,� Moyne told reporters.    AdvertisementThe princess, 43, sister of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has consistently denied any wrongdoing through her lawyers. She was not in court for the verdict. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling would complicate relations between Paris and Riyadh.  France has nurtured close ties with Saudi Arabia but those ties have been tested by President Emmanuel Macron�s determination to salvage Iran�s nuclear accord, which Saudi Arabia, alongside the United States, has adamantly opposed. The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Saudi royalty has faced legal problems in France before. In 2013, a French court ordered that the French assets of Saudi Princess Maha al-Sudairi, wife of former interior minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, be seized over unpaid bills at a luxury hotel totalling almost 6 million euros ($6.7 million).

Shah's statement came as he talked about Pakistan's crackdown on terror groups. Shah said in the same interview that the international community believes India and not Pakistan, on the Kashmir issue.",ANI,"Islamabad [Pakistan], Sep 12 (ANI): Pakistan has spent billions of rupees on proscribed terror outfit Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), admitted the country's interior minister on national television.  Brig (R) Ijaz Ahmed Shah said that the Imran Khan government has spent billions of Rupees on the terror outfit to attach them to the mainstream.Speaking to journalist Nadeem Malik, during a talk show aired on a Pakistani private news channel Hum News, the minister said, ""We have spent millions of rupees on JuD. We need to demotivate the members of the proscribed organisation and bring them down to the mainstream.""Earlier, during his maiden visit to the United States in July, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had made a similar revelation that his country still has about 30,000 to 40,000 militants ""who have been trained and fought in some part of Afghanistan or Kashmir.""Khan had also said that before his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government came into power, the governments did not have the ""political will"" to disarm militant groups operating on their soil.During a separate event, the Pakistani Prime Minister also said that they had 40 different militant groups operating within its borders.  Minister Shah's comments seem to be a face-saving measure ahead of the upcoming meeting of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in October.The watchdog is expected to submit its final evaluation report on Islamabad's action plan to curb terror financing next month. Last month, the FATF's regional affiliate Asia-Pacific Group (APG) had put Pakistan in the enhanced expedited follow-up list, a category reserved for countries having major deficiencies in their anti-money-laundering and counter-financing of terrorism framework and implementation.In another major embarrassing admission during the talk show, the minister also stated that Islamabad has failed to get support from the international community over its stand on Kashmir issue.Shah, in his remarks, blamed Pakistan ""ruling elite"" including Khan for ""destroying"" the image of the country, a day after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, during the 42nd UNHRC session in Geneva, claimed that India has transformed Jammu and Kashmir into the largest ""caged prison in this planet"" after the abrogation of Article 370 and that the human rights were being ""trampled with impunity"" there.

Parliament was prorogued - suspended - on Monday until Oct. 14, a move opposition lawmakers argued was designed to thwart their attempts to scrutinise his plans for leaving the European Union and to allow him to push through a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31.

Johnson said on Thursday those claims were �absolutely not� true.

This move was opposed by the locals as it was done without consulting them. It should be noted that India too had lodged a strong protest against this move.The 'Gilgit-Baltistan Order, 2018' ended the powers of Gilgit Baltistan Council and authorised the prime minister of Pakistan with complete authority over the region.After the declaration, all the powers of the local bodies were taken away including the authority to levy taxes. The new order cannot be challenged including in the courts.Apart from this order, the Pakistani government also tampered with the justice system of Gilgit-Baltistan with Pakistan PM having a say in choosing the hierarchy of the judiciary of the region, reported IANS.While the locals termed the move as just another step by the government to further suppress the indigenous people of the region. Pakistan had captured the region by force in 1947 and has been occupying it illegally since then.Lodging strong protest against the Pakistan government's move, the External Affairs Ministry summoned Pakistan's Deputy High Commissioner in Delhi clearly conveying that the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir which also includes the so-called 'Gilgit-Baltistan' areas belongs to India by virtue of its accession in 1947.Pakistan has conveniently ignored the large-scale human rights violations being carried out by its forces in Gilgit-Baltistan.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/gilgit-baltistan-is-technically-part-of-india-ex-director-of-european-commission/487218?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Amazon reportedly asked some sellers for the document to be submitted by September 9, two weeks after they started selling their products. This comes after recent reports which claimed that over 4,000 unsafe products were found listed on Amazon.",Engadget,"Some toys may appear on Amazon without being vetted for safety. According to a CNBC report, multiple third-party sellers say they were only asked for proof of safety compliance weeks after their products were listed for sale. While the practice might help speed up the listing process, it could also lead to unsafe products being sold on Amazon.An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that the company requests safety documentation ""very shortly"" after a product is listed by a third party seller. In an email statement, the company said it regularly contacts selling partners to request safety documentation. Sellers who do not provide the required documentation are removed immediately.That practice leaves a window in which unsafe toys could potentially be sold to consumers. To make matters worse, Amazon recently came under fire for selling thousands of items that federal agencies had deemed unsafe. After a Wall Street Journal investigation discovered everything from unregistered pesticides to banned toys on the site, three senators wrote a letter asking Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to launch a ""sweeping internal investigation"" into the company's safety policies.

1837,Water vapour found on 'super-Earth' in habitable zone in a first,"NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has helped astronomers find evidence of water vapour on a 'super-Earth' exoplanet in its star's ""habitable zone"" for the first time. The planet, K2-18b, is around 110 light-years away with temperatures neither too hot nor too cold which can support the presence of liquid water. However, scientists said it likely has a very high-pressure atmosphere.",Engadget,"Water vapor is common in gas giants; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all have H2O floating around in their atmospheres. But water on a rocky planet is exceedingly rare, making the discovery of water vapor -- and possibly even rain -- on the exoplanet K2-18 b a surprising breakthrough.A team at the Institute for Research on Exoplanets at the Universit� de Montr�al published their findings yesterday. Led by Bj�rn Benneke, their work (which has yet to be peer reviewed) points to the possibility that K2-18 b is habitable thanks to the presence of water and hydrogen, as well as the exoplanet's location in the Goldilocks zone. The Goldilocks zone is a range relative to a star where the temperature is not too hot and not too cold to support life. But while the temperature range and presence of water are good signs, K2-18 b isn't necessarily habitable. The exoplanet isn't a gas giant, but it does have a thick, high-pressure atmosphere that likely envelops a large, rocky core. Due to the crushing pressure, humans wouldn't be able to walk on the planet's surface; it would be more of a Cloud City situation, with pods floating in the gaseous atmosphere.K2-18 b is the least massive exoplanet to have water vapor detected in its atmosphere. The planet may even have rain clouds -- though the researchers weren't able to confirm that yet. As the water condenses into liquid, the drops would fall toward the core, then revert to gas as the atmospheric pressure increases. The gas would rise back up to the cloud layer and repeat the cycle.Benneke and his fellow researchers will follow up their work in the 2020s, after the James Webb Space Telescope is launched in 2021. This new telescope is even more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, which the team used to analyze K2-18 b as it passed in front of its star.

Their son was kidnapped by an autorickshaw driver and sold to an orphanage that facilitated illegal adoptions. The couple met Avinash after a long legal battle.",The News Minute,"September 8, 2019 � Nageshwar Rao and Sivagami will remember this day forever. This was the day that the Chennai based couple finally met their son, who was cruelly kidnapped in February 1999 and sent to the US for adoption.In a moment that was filled with joy, relief, and tears, Nageshwar and Sivagami, along with their two children Sarala and Lokesh, met Avinash, their son who was not over three when he was snatched away from them. Then called Subash, he was taken to Malaysian Social Service (MSS), an orphanage that facilitated the illegal adoptions of over 300 children from poor socio-economic backgrounds in Chennai. Many of these children were sent overseas to countries like the US, Australia, and Netherlands. ��It was overwhelming,� Avinash tells TNM. �After all these years of planning and preparation, I couldn�t believe this was finally happening. I saw them, and I was speechless. I was scared, but the good kind of scared. And also happy,� the 22-year-old shares.""We were happy, and also sad thinking we had lost him for so many years,� Nageshwar Rao, now 47, tells TNM. �It was touching to know that he cared for us even now, without having met any of us for 20 years.�Avinash only speaks English, having been brought up by an American couple and his birth family only speaks Tamil. So, they could not communicate directly, and had to rely on translations from Mohanavadivelan Saravanan, the advocate who has been representing Nageshwar and Sivagami in their case against MSS, and his daughter. �But there was a sense of peace, comfort and familiarity. When my mother hugged me, she cried. I could feel their emotions, all that build up from waiting for this moment,� Avinash says.
	Avinash with his birth mother, SivagamiYears of waitingNageshwar is a construction painter, and his wife Sivagami, a homemaker. Their son was kidnapped from Pulianthope in Chennai by an autorickshaw driver and sold to MSS in 1999.� When a CBI investigation into the crimes of MSS finally traced Avinash to an American family years later, Nageshwar and Sivagami only wished to be in touch with their son. They understandood that it would be impractical to uproot Avinash from where he had grown up.However, despite a positive paternity test, the couple was unable to meet Avinash. That was until he turned 18, and Scott Carney, a journalist, who reported on Nageshwar Rao�s story in 2009 in�Mother Jones, put him in touch with Mohanavadivelan.The advocate put Avinash in touch with Sarala, his sister. The siblings have been in touch over WhatsApp, and while the language barrier exists between them too, they have exchanged photos and gotten to know each other in the limited ways they could.�All these years, we tried our best to keep�in touch with him. We sent emails and letters. When he wrote to our lawyer, it was completely unexpected,� Nageshwar Rao says.Avinash says that though he always knew that he was adopted, his desire to reconnect with his birth family has to do with where he was brought up. �The mid-west in the US is a very white area. I grew up having all white friends. I questioned why I was different.��I was taught that I should never forget where I came from. But to do that, I needed to find out where that was; find out more about my people, my family, and my culture,� he adds.Sivagami, Avinash�s birth mother, reportedly went into depression when she lost Avinash overnight. Scott Carney reported that when he met her 10 years after Avinash was taken, she would still break down at the mention of his name. Now, at least, she has found some relief, her husband says.�My wife has cried for so many years. She was relieved to finally meet him,� Nageshwar Rao says.
	Avinash with his birth parents, and siblings Lokesh (far left) and Sarala (far right)Faith and patienceMSS was convicted by a Chennai court earlier this year, and fined Rs 10,000 for their crime of separating scores of children from their families . However, activists who have been working against illegal overseas adoptions argued that the punishment came too late; even the main accused in the case, then MSS Chairperson PV Ravindranath, died a few years ago.Nageshwar Rao, Sivagami and Avinash�s story is an exception to the norm � many families have not been able to get in touch with their children who were snatched from them and are now adoptees in other countries. Others, like Fathima and Salia, whose daughter was also kidnapped by MSS in 1998, have been shut down by their now adult children, who want nothing to do with a birth family they have little to no recollection of, a culture and country they have no way to relate to.�Nageshwar and Sivagami were very patient. And it took time because this was a matter involving two countries. The investigation also happened properly. That worked in their favour,� Mohanavadivelan tells TNM. And for this, Nageshwar and his family express thanks to the advocate, who has been representing them pro bono, as well as Arun Dohle of Against Child Trafficking (ACT), who has been closely following cases of illegal overseas adoptions and helping Nageshwar Rao and other such famliies.�Avinash meanwhile has already made plans to get to know his birth family better. He is in Chennai till Thursday and plans to visit their home, the hospital that he was born in. On Tuesday, they have plans to go to the beach, and to Mahabalipuram on Wednesday.�The next time I come here, I hope to have learnt some Tamil. I love to talk, and I want to tell them how I feel, understand how they feel without someone translating. Even though I am very grateful to Mohanavadivelan and his family for helping us talk, I want to connect with my family here more by being able to speak Tamil,� says Avinash, who recently graduated with a degree in finance.�I fly back to the US on Thursday. But this time, the goodbye is only temporary,� he says.�Also read: 20 yrs later, Chennai court convicts orphanage that kidnapped kids and gave for adoption overseas",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/chennai-couple-reunite-son-who-was-kidnapped-20-years-ago-and-adopted-us-108677?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The Dalits said their water supply has been limited because of the lock. Block Development Officer said they have ordered to remove the lock.",The News Minute,"Caste based discrimination and related atrocities are not a new evil in Tamil Nadu, and several incidents of people from marginalised castes being denied access to resources have been reported even recently. In the last two weeks alone, two separate incidents of Dalits being denied access to burial sites for cremating deceased members of their community were reported across the state. So what happens when the resources being controlled by dominant castes can be as basic as drinking water? In the latest such case of atrocity to be exposed in Tamil Nadu, a community of� Dalits in Kayampatti village in Madurai West have reportedly been denied full access to drinking water.�According to sources, Kayampatti�s 200-odd families have been regularly drawing water from a 25-year old overhead tank for their drinking water needs. This water is supplied via two separate valves � one for the dominant caste households � Kallars, Nadars and Chettiars � and the other for Adi Dravidar settlements (Dalits).However, members of the 90-odd Adi Dravidar families in Kayampatti have been complaining that for the last three to four years, the dominant caste residents have been limiting their access to the water in the tank. �They put a lock on the valve which supplies water to us. They are doing this to intentionally limit the water we receive, while they use unlimited amount of water from the tank,� says Saravanan, a resident of Kayampatti.�While water was being distributed through separate valves for the last two decades in the village, dominant castes limiting Dalits� access to water is a new phenomenon, residents say. The locked valve is opened at specific times of the day, forcing members of the Adi Dravidar community to rush to store water.��We hardly get enough water for our needs. During the day, when everyone has to go to work, most people scramble for water. All we ask is that the water is supplied equally to everyone without prejudice,� Bhakyalakshmi, another resident told Puthiya Thalamurai.�Each family in the Dalit colony gets just two to three pots of water per day. The valve is also unlocked at erratic times with no specific windows, according to residents.��Sometimes they open it for 30 minutes and at other times for over an hour. Usually water is supplied to the colony members anywhere between 6 and 7.30 am while the dominant caste residents enjoy unlimited supply with no time constraints,� says a source from Madurai.�For several months now, residents say they have attempted to raise the issue with the District Collector and the Panchayat Development Officer or PDO, but to no avail. Political parties too have failed to offer any solutions to the residents here.�With the incident being exposed by a journalist working with Puthiya Thalaimurai channel, officials from the PDO office inspected the tank and removed the lock on the valve on Tuesday. Promises have also been made to undertake restoration and servicing of corroded pipelines in the Dalit colony.�According to sources, water supply also faces blockage due to old and corroding pipelines in the Dalit colony.��The pipelines supplying water to the houses of the dominant caste residents were recently serviced by the Panchayat Union.

1889,Warner's lean patch will test his character: Justin Langer,"Talking about Australia opener David Warner, who has registered three ducks in his eight 2019 Ashes innings, team's coach Justin Langer said, ""He's a world-class player...so it's going to be a good test of his character."" The former opener added, ""He hasn't got the runs he wants at the moment but jeez I'm looking forward to seeing...when he does.""",Cricket Australia,"If anyone appreciates the opportunity the final Ashes Test at The Oval presents for Australia's struggling opener David Warner, it's men's team coach Justin Langer.Warner has endured a tough series tackling the new ball, particularly against England seamer Stuart Broad, and has managed just one double-figure score (61) in eight innings with ducks from each of his last three starts.But Langer has once again thrown his support behind the former vice-captain, reiterating his belief that if Warner produces just one of his trademark, quick-fire knocks of substance then Australia are favoured to win the final Test.And the Australia coach can reflect upon his own experience wrought from similar circumstance when he claims The Oval provides the ideal venue for Warner to turn his series around.During Australia's 2001 Ashes campaign in the UK, Langer lost his place in Australia's Test team having posted a solitary half-century from his previous seven innings.He was thrown a lifeline for the final Test when Michael Slater was dropped after failing to pass 25 in six successive innings.Then, having been installed in the role of opener, Langer made a career-defining century that led to him becoming a permanent fixture in Australia's Test team for the next six years.Langer has been asked several times during the current campaign about Warner's form and the hold established over him by Broad (who has dismissed him six times in eight innings) and has responded similarly on each occasion.He has claimed that seeing proven players of Warner's calibre enduring a lean trot brings a smile to his face because he knows the run-drought will eventually break.However, when the topic was raised again after Australia completed their penultimate training session of the tour at The Oval on Tuesday, he conceded that Warner's contribution of 79 runs at 9.87 per innings was a concern.""Davey hasn't had a great series, there's no secrets about that,"" Langer said.""But he's also a word-class player and I've said throughout the whole series, if Davey has one good innings it'll help us win the Ashes.""He probably hasn't been through this lean run before, so it's going to be a good test of his character.""But he's a match-winner and he's been brilliant around the group since he's been back (from suspension).""He's been great, good for the crowds, good amongst the group.""He hasn't got the runs he wants at the moment but jeez I'm looking forward to seeing it when he does, and there's no better place in the world to bat than The Oval.""Warner spent much of Tuesday's nets session, in which the bowlers from the fourth Test win at Old Trafford did not take part, sending down a lengthy spell of his right-arm seamers.But he donned the pads late in the hit-out to pit himself against throw-downs delivered by his former skipper and in-form batter of the current Ashes series, Steve Smith.For the only time since he was forced to sit-out training due to the effects of delayed concussion, Smith attended practice but did not pick up a bat.Having already faced 998 deliveries in this Ashes series, from which he has scored 671 runs at an average of 134.2 per innings, Smith hardly needs to engage in any drills to improve his already razor-sharp form.But the sight of the world's top-ranked Test batter choosing not to enter the nets where he has been a near-permanent fixture since Australia arrived in the UK almost five months ago was noteworthy for its uniqueness.Langer was quick to scotch any suggestion that Smith opted out of batting on Tuesday because he was tired of hitting balls.""I know he's got some strong goals for this series, and moving forward,"" Langer said of the former Australia captain.""I'd say, after spending that much time in the middle and the emotions of the last game (at Old Trafford), sometimes with batters it's more a mental rest than anything else.""I've got a feeling he might hit a few balls tomorrow (Wednesday).""The dominance of Smith, who has scored more than twice as many runs as any other batter in the series apart from England allrounder Ben Stokes (354 runs at 59), suggests that batting has been nigh-on impossible for mere mortals.However, Langer said

1890,Add impartial stories about us on upcoming news tab: FB to curators,"Facebook has sent a memo to its employees containing guidelines for curators for its upcoming news tab which instructed them not to censor 'bad news' about the company. The memo also notified curators to ""impartially share stories about Facebook, Facebook executives and tech at large"". Facebook confirmed in August that it will launch the news tab later this year.",Engadget,"Facebook confirmed in August that it's using a small team of journalists to pick the top stories for its upcoming News Tab section. Now, The Information has revealed more details about the guidelines those editors have to follow. The publication says Facebook sent employees an internal memo containing its guidelines for curators, including prioritizing pieces with on-the-record sources over those with anonymous ones.The team will prioritize the media outlets that report a particular news story first, and it'll also give the highest priority to local outlets for local news. However, members can't highlight anything until two publications have published pieces on the same story if it's based on an ""unsubstantiated report."" They're also instructed not to feature stories meant to ""provoke, divide and polarize"" unless they're ""fact-based stories that rely upon journalistic standards.""While no piece that uses a headline with profanities and obscenities will be featured, Facebook aims to show a ""diversity of voices"" by featuring a range of topics and publishers. The social network reportedly also clarified in the memo that it will instruct the curators not to censor bad news about the company itself and to ""impartially share stories about Facebook, Facebook executives and tech at large.""Whether using journalists is better than using algorithms to keep the News Tab's top stories updated remains to be seen. Facebook had been accused of showing political bias -- which makes the use of human curators a cause for concern for some -- and having faulty algorithms in the past. You might be able to decide for yourself soon enough: the company is reportedly scheduled to roll the feature out in October.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/11/facebook-news-tab-curators-guidelines/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1895,Arab League condemns Netanyahu's plans to annex Jordan Valley,"Arab League condemned a plan by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to annex parts of Palestinian territories as ""aggression"" undermining any chances of a peace settlement with the Palestinians. Netanyahu on Tuesday said he planned to annex the Jordan Valley, a large swathe of the occupied West Bank, if he is re-elected in polls to be held on September 17.",Reuters,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Arab foreign ministers condemned a plan by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex parts of the occupied West Bank as �aggression� undermining any chances of a peace settlement with the Palestinians. Netanyahu said on Tuesday he planned to annex the Jordan Valley, a large swathe of the occupied West Bank, if he wins a closely contested election just a week away.  Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war and Palestinians, who signed interim peace deals with Israel in the 1990s that include security cooperation, seek to make it part of a future state. The Arab League �considers his announcement a dangerous development and a new Israeli aggression by declaring the intention to violate the international law,� Arab foreign ministers said in a statement after a meeting in Cairo. �The league regards these statements as undermining the chances of any progress in the peace process and will torpedo all its foundations,� the statement said. Arab foreign ministers had been holding a meeting in Cairo, seat of the Arab League, but added an emergency session after Netanyahu made his comments on live television. Around 65,000 Palestinians and 11,000 Israeli settlers live in the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area, according to the Israeli human rights group B�Tselem. The main Palestinian city is Jericho, with around 28 villages and smaller Bedouin communities. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on Twitter called Netanyahu�s plan a �serious escalation�. Jordan and Egypt are the only Arab states to have peace treaties with Israel. Hanan Ashrawi, a senior official in the Palestine Liberation Organization, wrote on Twitter that the Israeli leader was out to impose a �greater Israel on all of historical Palestine and (carry) out an ethnic cleansing agenda�. Fighting for his political life after an inconclusive election in April, Netanyahu also reaffirmed a pledge to annex all of the settlements Israel has established in the West Bank.  White House senior adviser Jared Kushner said in early May that he hoped Israel would take a hard look at President Donald Trump�s upcoming Middle East peace proposal before �proceeding with any plan� to annex West Bank settlements. Saudi Arabia condemned Netanyahu�s comments and called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, state news agency SPA said. Qatar reiterated its support for a two-state peace solution.

1914,Audi unveils AI:Trail quattro concept with drones as headlights,"Audi unveiled its new all-electric, all-terrain AI:Trail quattro concept at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show which has drones as headlights called 'Audi Light Pathfinders'. The vehicle will have a total of five rotorless, triangular, electrically-operated drones with integrated matrix LED elements that can fly around the vehicle, shining light on the path ahead as well as recording videos.",Engadget,"Concept cars are a dime a dozen. Concepts that are built specifically to be taken offroad, those are a special breed of fun. At Frankfurt International Auto Show Audi unveiled the AI:Trail concept.""The design is more than just a shape, it's an attitude,"" said Marc Lichte Audi's head designer.No word on things like range or battery size. Of course, it's a concept car, so none of these numbers really matter all that much. What's important is that hopefully, Audi takes some design and powertrain cues from the AI: Trail and builds something like it. Sure the Q line is nice, but it's not exactly what you would call rugged.To remind us that we probably won't see it in showrooms anytime soon, Audi added some weird features to the vehicle.""We replaced the headlights with five drones that fly ahead and illuminate the road,"" Lichte said. While trusting drones to keep you on the road in the dead of night seems sort of insane and will never make it into production, it's still a fun way to look at the world.But before you dismiss the idea outright, Audi's chief of lighting design, Cesar Muntada explained that the lights would create a sort of dome of illumination around the car instead of piercing the night. Also, those drones could follow you after you leave the vehicle and light-up the world around you.Meanwhile, the rear seats are a hammock. Another crazy idea but one that's a bit more comfortable for passengers.To keep the fun theme moving, Audi also announced that its E-Tron electric scooter (the push kind not the ""Vespa"" kind) will launch next year. I rode one in Los Angeles and it was fun, but also a bit scary because Los Angeles' downtown traffic is very aggressive.Sure Audi is about performance and luxury, but I'm digging the fun angle they're showing off at the Frankfurt show.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/audi-a-trail-concept-ev-unveil/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

1921,Hong Kong protests called off to mark 9/11 attacks anniversary,"Hong Kong activists on Wednesday called off anti-government protests in remembrance of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on the US. The protestors also denounced a Chinese state newspaper report claiming that protesters were planning ""massive terror"" attacks in Hong Kong. Anti-government protests in Hong Kong began after a bill to allow extraditions to China was introduced.",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong activists called off protests on Wednesday in remembrance of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and denounced a Chinese state newspaper report that they were planning �massive terror� in the Chinese-ruled city. Hong Kong has been rocked by months of sometimes violent unrest, prompted by anger over planned legislation to allow extraditions to China, but broadening into calls for democracy and for Communist rulers in Beijing to leave the city alone. �Anti-government fanatics are planning massive terror attacks, including blowing up gas pipes, in Hong Kong on September 11,� the Hong Kong edition of the China Daily said on its Facebook page, alongside a picture of the hijacked airliner attacks on the twin towers in New York. �The 9/11 terror plot also encourages indiscriminate attacks on non-native speakers of Cantonese and starting mountain fires.� The post said �leaked information was part of the strategy being schemed by radical protesters in their online chat rooms�. The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a �one country, two systems� formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent legal system, triggering the anger over the extradition bill. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said she will withdraw the bill but many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is steadily eroding the autonomy of the Asian financial hub. China denies meddling and has accused the United States, Britain and others of fomenting the unrest. �We don�t even need to do a fact check to know that this is fake news,� said one protester, Michael, 24, referring to the China Daily post. �The state media doesn�t care about its credibility. Whenever something they claimed to have heard on WhatsApp or friends� friends, they will spread it right away.� The protesters called off action on Wednesday. �In solidarity against terrorism, all forms of protest in Hong Kong will be suspended on Sept. 11, apart from potential singing and chanting,� they said in a statement. The China Daily report was worrying, said another protester, Karen, 23. �When they try to frame the whole protest with those words, it alarms me,� she said. �They are predicting rather than reporting. I think people calling it off today is a nice move.� The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, Pansy Ho, a prominent businesswoman and daughter of Macau casino operator Stanley Ho, said she was worried about violent extremism. �Children of all ages are indoctrinated with police hatred and anti-establishment beliefs at school and online mobilized to conduct massive school strikes,� she told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.   Lam said in a speech on Wednesday that Hong Kong was grappling with significant challenges. �My fervent hope is that we can bridge our divide by upholding the one country, two systems principle, and the Basic Law, and through the concerted efforts of the government and the people of Hong Kong,� she told business leaders. The Basic Law is Hong Kong�s mini-constitution. Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has become the biggest corporate casualty of the unrest after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, the protests. Cathay Pacific said on Wednesday inbound traffic to Hong Kong in August fell 38% and outbound traffic 12% compared with a year earlier, and that it did not anticipate September to be any less difficult.  Joshua Wong, one of the prominent leaders of the 2014 �Umbrella� pro-democracy movement which brought key streets in Hong Kong to a standstill for 79 days, said in Berlin that the fight for democracy was an uphill battle. �I hope one day not only Hong Kong people, but also people in mainland China, can enjoy freedom and democracy,� he said. The protests spread to the sports field on Tuesday, as many football fans defied Chinese law to boo the national anthem ahead of a soccer World Cup qualifier against Iran. Several peaceful protests are planned for the next few days, combining with celebrations marking the Mid-Autumn Festival.

1923,China removes tariffs on some US goods ahead of Oct talks,"China has removed retaliatory tariffs on 16 types of US products ahead of talks scheduled in October. The 25% additional tariffs were put in place last year by China on about $50 billion worth US imports. The exemptions will start on September 17 and last for a year. The list included varieties of animal feed, cancer drugs gefitinib and capecitabine.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday welcomed China�s decision to exempt some U.S. anti-cancer drugs and other goods from its tariffs and announced a short delay to scheduled tariff hikes on billions worth of Chinese goods. Stock markets in Asia rose on the news in early Thursday trade, as the concessions came days ahead of a planned meeting aimed at defusing the escalating trade war between the world�s two largest economies. China�s decision to exempt some U.S. goods was a �big move� by Beijing and a positive gesture before trade negotiators from both countries meet in Washington, Trump told reporters at the White House. China on Wednesday announced its first batch of tariff exemptions for 16 types of U.S. products, including some anti-cancer drugs and lubricants, as well as animal feed ingredients whey and fish meal, according to a Ministry of Finance statement on its website. �They made a couple of moves ... that were pretty good,� Trump said at an unrelated event on vaping. �I think it was a gesture, okay? But it was a big move.� On Wednesday, Trump wrote in a post on Twitter that the United States had agreed to delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15 �as a gesture of good will.� The tariffs were set to increase to 30% from 25% on the goods. Trump said he hoped to reach a trade agreement with China following more than a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of tariffs that have roiled global markets. �I deal with them and I know them and I like them,� he said. �I hope we can do something.� Asian stocks rose on Thursday, while China�s yuan currency was also up 0.27 percent in offshore trade, as investors hoped for a thaw in U.S.-China trade frictions. Deputy trade negotiators are due to meet in Washington in mid-September, with minister-level talks to follow in October. Exact dates for the meetings have not been released. The gestures may ease tensions ahead of the negotiations, but some analysts don�t see it as a signal that both sides are readying a deal. �The exemption could be seen as a gesture of sincerity towards the U.S. ahead of negotiations in October but is probably more a means of supporting the economy,� ING�s Greater China economist Iris Pang wrote in a note.  �There are still many uncertainties in the coming trade talks. An exemption list of just 16 items will not change China�s stance,� she said.  Indeed, the exempted list pales in comparison to over 5,000 types of U.S. products that are already subject to China�s additional tariffs. Moreover, major U.S. imports, such as soybeans and pork, are still subject to hefty additional duties, as China has ramped up imports from Brazil and other supplying countries. Beijing has said it would work on exempting some U.S. products from tariffs if they are not easily substituted from elsewhere. The United States is by far China�s largest supplier of whey, which is an important ingredient in piglet feed and difficult to source in large volumes from elsewhere.  Analysts say that with its duties on soybeans and U.S.-made cars, China is taking aim at a key political support base of Trump, mainly the factories and farms across the Midwest and South at a time of receding momentum in the world�s top economy.   China has imposed several rounds of duties on U.S. goods in retaliation against U.S. Section 301 tariffs, beginning last year in July and August with a 25% levy on about $50 billion of U.S. imports.  In all, the United States and China have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods in a bitter trade war that has raised the spectre of a global recession, with further tariffs slated to take effect in coming months. The items on the two tariff exemption lists - posted on the ministry�s website - will not be subject to additional duties imposed by China on U.S. goods �as countermeasures to U.S. Section 301 measures,� the ministry said in its statement. The exemption will take effect on Sept. 17 and be valid for a year through to Sept. 16, 2020, it said. Beijing said in May that it would start a waiver programme, amid growing worries over the cost of the protracted trade war on its already slowing economy. ING�s Pang noted the United States had also exempted imports of 110 Chinese products from tariffs in July, including high-value items such as medical equipment and parts.  Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are expected to meet in early October in the U.S. capital, but key officials are tamping down expectations for a major accord. For two years, the Trump administration has sought to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its policies on intellectual property protection, forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms, industrial subsidies and market access.  Beijing and Washington were close to a deal last spring but U.S. officials said China backed away from an agreed text over a reluctance to change laws to address U.S. complaints. The South China Morning Post reported, citing an unidentified source, that China was expected to buy more agricultural products in hopes of a better trade deal with the United States. Senior White House adviser Peter Navarro this week urged investors, businesses and the public to be patient about the trade dispute. Earlier on Wednesday, a survey by a prominent American business association showed the trade dispute was souring the profit and investment outlook for U.S. companies operating in the world�s second-biggest economy.

Leh and Kargil are also normal, there is no restriction of any kind there,"" he said while addressing a press conference here.""In this region, we have tried to ease out the restrictions whichever kind of restrictions were imposed. More than 90 per cent areas are free of restrictions, 100% telephone exchanges are working now. You have got two districts where the cellphones are also working now,"" he added.The DGP said due to restraint and very minimal use of force by the security personnel, the casualties on the civilian side have been absolutely nil barring an incident where a stone-pelter got injured in down-town and he subsequently succumbed to his injuries.""On the contrary, we have had incidents where stone-pelters caused injuries to the civilians and also caused civilian death in Bhijbhera,"" he said referring to the truck driver being killed by stone-pelters.The DGP further said that during this period, militants killed three people while two terrorists have also been neutralised.Talking about the encounter in which Asif Maqbool Bhatt, the LeT terrorist who was responsible for injuring a 30-month-old baby in Sopore, was neutralised, the DGP said. ""With his killing, I believe the area will heave a sigh of relief and the terror which he was creating there would be taken care of to some extent. We also know two of his other associates. We are after them and we will see that in the near future, we take care of them also.""The DGP held a group of JeM militants led by a Pakistani terrorist responsible for the killing of Gujjar brothers in Pulwama area.""The Gujjar brothers were the regular visitors to the area. A possibility could be that these militants would be going in that area earlier also. There is a group of JeM militants led by a Pakistani terrorist. He is responsible for their killing. So far, nothing concrete has come out but the possibility is that they must have suspected them of something or there must have been personal kind of grudge between them on a certain issue but nothing specific as of now has come,"" he said.""But that certainly has created terror in that area and this is precisely what the militants today want. Militants sponsored by Pakistan with whatever violent activities they could do in the area to scare people, they have been trying to resort to that,"" he added.The DGP said militants have been going around in South Kashmir and threatening people by putting up posters. He expressed hope that they will be able to neutralise the threats in South Kashmir region.Asked about the restrictions imposed in the state in the wake of abrogation of Article 370, he said, ""We are considering more such relaxations considering the people have been very-very cooperative. Our experience has been that Pakistan sponsored militants have made very-very malicious use of social media platforms. It was only with a view to prevent that kind of malicious fake propaganda. We are conscious that it causes inconvenience to the people.""The Police Chief said there have been many reports of infiltration from the Pakistani side being attempted in certain areas.""Two persons who came via Gulmarg were apprehended by the Army. A large number of militants have been brought at the launching pads,"" he said.Singh also said that there are hardly any reports of fresh recruitments in the terrorist ranks in the Valley.""Hardly any report of fresh people joining militant ranks.

1935,Hong Kong Exchanges offers to buy London Stock Exchange for $39 bn,"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has made an unsolicited $39 billion bid to acquire the London Stock Exchange Group. This comes just weeks after LSE announced a plan to purchase financial information provider Refinitiv. Hong Kong Exchanges, which owns the London Metal Exchange, said the proposed deal would go ahead only if LSE's proposed takeover of Refinitiv doesn't proceed.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (0388.HK) unveiled a $39 billion takeover approach to the London Stock Exchange Plc (LSE) (LSE.L) on Wednesday that received a cool response from investors concerned about its regulatory and financial hurdles. To prevail, HKEX would have to persuade British politicians and European regulators to abandon their deep-rooted scepticism over mergers of financial exchanges.  It would also have to woo LSE shareholders who are in favor of maintaining their ownership following LSE�s $27 billion deal last month to acquire financial data provider Refinitiv. In an ominous sign for the deal�s prospects, LSE shares ended trading on Wednesday at a deep discount to HKEX�s offer price. With its bid, HKEX is betting that a major international acquisition will help it overcome uncertainty at home. Hong Kong�s pro-democracy protests in the last few weeks over China�s political influence have raised questions among major companies and investors about the appeal of the Hong Kong bourse. HKEX is also seeking to capitalize on the weakness of the British pound, which has been hit by Britain�s inability to settle on a deal to leave the European Union. The weaker pound has made British companies cheaper for foreign acquirers. The proposed deal is aimed at creating a combined group better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) and CME Group inc (CME.O). It is contingent on LSE abandoning the deal to acquire Refinitiv. �The board of HKEX believes a proposed combination with LSE represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure leader,� the Hong Kong exchange said in a statement. The LSE said it would review HKEX�s proposal. In a sign of its cool reception to HKEX�s bid, it added that it was committed to, and continued to, make good progress on its planned acquisition of Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N) and Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO). Thomson Reuters is the parent of Reuters News. Spokespeople for Refinitiv, Blackstone and Thomson Reuters declined to comment.   Under the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE once the deal has gone through.    HKEX, whose main shareholder is the Hong Kong government, said its 31.6 billion pounds cash-and-share transaction proposal represented a 22.9% premium to the LSE�s closing stock price on Tuesday of 8,361 pence.  LSE shares ended trading on Wednesday only up 5.9% at 7,206 pence. The significant gap with HKEX�s offer price reflects widespread scepticism that the bid will succeed, investors said. A key challenge: Securing the support of the British government, which has already signaled some wariness over handing control of its stock exchange to a foreign acquirer with close links to China.  The UK Treasury described the LSE as a �critically important part� of the British financial system. �As you would expect, the government and the regulators will be looking at the (proposed deal) details closely,� a spokesman said. �It looks uncertain whether shareholders will accept the offer, given that the Refinitiv deal is popular across the shareholder base for its potential to transform the business and add value over the long-term,� said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Jupiter, a top-25 investor in the LSE.  A Hong Kong company acquiring one of Britain�s marquee financial institutions - which also owns the Milan exchange and is a major clearing house in the United States - would be a challenging feat for HKEX.  Germany�s Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) has failed three times in recent years to acquire LSE, hitting opposition from politicians and regulators.  It was also not immediately clear whether the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns, would also have jurisdiction to review HKEX�s bid for LSE, analysts said.  A spokesman for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not respond to a request for comment on whether the deal would be subject to CFIUS review. Refinitiv�s deal with LSE came just 10 months after Blackstone bought a majority stake in the unit from Thomson Reuters in a $20 billion deal. LSE has said it expects the Refinitiv acquisition to close in the second half of 2020. Were it to walk away, it would have to pay Refinitiv a 198.3 million pound break-up fee.  Emboldened by the lukewarm reaction in LSE�s stock, Blackstone stayed put on Wednesday, viewing HKEX�s chances of success as remote, according to people familiar with the matter.  Prices of bonds issued by Refinitiv were only slightly lower in secondary trading on Wednesday, suggesting investors did not view the deal with LSE at risk. For an interactive version of this chart, click here here HKEX has been the world�s largest listings venue in five of the past 10 years, going head-to-head against the New York Stock Exchange over that decade, according to Refinitiv data.  But this year it has fallen behind, raising $10.8 billion to the NYSE�s $20.2 billion, with activity suffering as the political turmoil deepened. Last month, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) delayed plans for a $15 billion offering in Hong Kong because of the unrest. No other bid for LSE appeared forthcoming on Wednesday. Benjamin Jackson, president of New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, placed his company out of the running. �The reasons are, you have Brexit uncertainty, you�ve got valuations, you�ve got deals that have to meet our internal rate of return criteria that we put forth,� he said at a Barclays financial services conference on Wednesday. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, CME Chairman and CEO Terry Duffy also poured cold water on the idea of a bid. �I just closed on my European transaction with NEX in November, and I�m laser focused on the integration of that and growing our core business,� Duffy said.  LSE CEO David Schwimmer has said that big takeovers in exchanges are difficult due to political concerns. In recent years the LSE has sought to diversify away from basic trading and clearing to data and analytics. The Asian exchange, however, said it was confident its proposal faced no major regulatory hurdles due to little overlap in markets. HKEX said it has already begun discussions with certain regulators in Britain and Hong Kong. �The board of HKEX believes that the two businesses are highly complementary and as such, looks forward to working with the relevant authorities to deliver a clear path to completion,� it added. Should the proposed takeover be successful, it is expected that key LSE management would continue to operate LSE businesses, HKEX said. The Hong Kong government threw its support behind the move. �The government is glad to see HKEX�s endeavor to enhance its core strength and seek international expansion in accordance with its strategic plan,� a spokesman said.

1953,SL deny Pak's claim that India influenced their cricketers to not go to Pak,"Sri Lanka Sports Minister Harin Fernando has rubbished Pakistani minister Fawad Chaudhry's claim that India influenced their cricketers to opt out of their tour to Pakistan. He added that some players opted out ""purely"" based on 2009 incident when their team bus was attacked by terrorists. ""Respecting their decision we picked players who were willing to travel,"" he said.",CricTracker,"Sri Lanka�s tour of�Pakistan�is scheduled to get underway on September 27. But even before the commencement of the fixtures, the tour has been making quite a bit of headlines. It�ll be the first time since 2009 when the Lankans would be playing a full-fledged series in the war-stricken nation. However, the hosts would be devoid of 10 players, who backed out citing security concerns.The likes of Lasith Malinga, the T20I skipper, Dimuth Karunaratne, the ODI skipper, former captain Angelo Mathews, and seven others won�t be a part of the series. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) didn�t comment on the same as it believes that it�s SLC�s internal matter. Last month, the security delegations gave a positive feedback to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) following which the tour was finalised.AdvertisementIn the meantime, Fawad Hussain, a Pakistani minister, hurled allegations at India for threatening Sri Lanka. He told India iterated the fact that if the Lankan players tour Pakistan for the bilateral series, then they�ll be barred from taking part in the cash-rich and prestigious�Indian Premier League (IPL). He slammed the Indian authorities for cheap tactics and blamed them for jingoism in sports.Hussain took to Twitter and opined on the matter. �Informed sports commentators told me that India threatened SL players that they�ll be ousted from IPL if they don�t refuse Pak visit, this is a really cheap tactic, jingoism from sports to space is something we must condemn, really cheap on the part of Indian sports authorities.�After Hussain brought the serious allegations, Sri Lankan Sports Minister Harin Fernando has opened up. He was clear cut in saying that the reports of India influencing Sri Lanka over the international games are completely baseless. Fernando added that the SLC respected the 10 players� decision to back out and hopes to beat Pakistan with a full-strength team.He took to Twitter and wrote, �No truth to reports that�India�influenced Sri Lankan players not to play in Pakistan.

Cox Automotive, the company behind Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, has made a $350 million equity investment in Rivian.  The publications won't play much of a role, to be clear.  Rather, this is about a chance to ""explore partnership opportunities"" in the other areas of Cox's business, including digital retail, logistics and service ops.  Cox owns companies like Manheim, which services, transports and auctions cars worldwide.This isn't the largest capital injection Rivian has received this year.  An Amazon-led round raised $700 million, while Ford poured $500 million into the company to help make a brand-new vehicle.  It's still a large amount, though, and it shows how many in the tech and automotive worlds see Rivian as their great hope.  It's a rare startup that both appears to have a realistic path to mainstream EV sales and the cutting edge technology needed to compete with heavyweights like Tesla.

1958,WeWork to reject SoftBank's request to delay its IPO: Report,Co-working space startup WeWork is reportedly pressing ahead with its plan to go public despite its main investor SoftBank's push to delay its Initial Public Offering (IPO) over valuation concerns. WeWork's parent firm The We Company may reportedly seek a valuation as low as $15-18 billion. SoftBank has invested $10.65 billion in WeWork since 2017 through its $100-billion Vision Fund.,Reuters,"(Reuters) - Office-sharing startup WeWork is pressing ahead with plans to go public despite lukewarm interest in its shares, three sources said, leaving its largest investor, SoftBank Group (9984.T), with a stark choice: take a haircut or pony up even more cash.  The We Company, WeWork�s parent, may seek a valuation as low as $15 billion to $18 billion in an initial public offering, down from the $47 billion value it commanded in the last private fundraising round in January, one source familiar with the situation said. That means SoftBank, which has invested $10.65 billion in WeWork since 2017 through its Saudi-backed $100 billion Vision Fund and other vehicles, would have to write down the value of its investment should the IPO go ahead.  Sources familiar with the situation cautioned that no final decisions have yet been made and the plans around valuation and timing of the IPO are all still subject to change. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is private. SoftBank declined to comment. We Company also declined to comment.    The sharply lower valuation reflects concerns around the sustainability of We Company�s business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, and how such a model would weather an economic downturn, according to investors and analysts.  A sharp cut to WeWork�s valuation would be a blow to SoftBank as at a time when it is seeking funds from investors for a second Vision Fund, for which it says $108 billion in pledges have been secured.  Returns for SoftBank first Vision Fund have already been hit by lackluster listings of Uber (UBER.N) and Slack (WORK.N). SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son and longtime lieutenant and group Vice Chairman Ron Fisher were in favor of the WeWork IPO until last week, even as others inside the group were pushing for a delay, one of the sources said.  However, in recent days Son and Fisher have now conceded internally that a delay might be in SoftBank�s best interests, the source added.  Son and SoftBank have been pushing We Company Chief Executive Adam Neumann to delay the IPO but have so far failed to persuade him, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  Having burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of the year, WeWork requires a fresh injection of funds and is looking to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion in the IPO, Reuters has reported.  Adding to the importance of We Company going public is the $6 billion in bank commitments it secured in August, which is dependent on it raising at least $3 billion from the IPO. Given its need for cash, a postponement of the IPO would be feasible if SoftBank would inject more cash into WeWork, a proposition Son has so far been reluctant to pursue given how much the fund has already put in, according to two sources.  For its part, WeWork may now wait until Monday of next week to begin its roadshow to pitch the IPO to investors given that it is still waiting on approval for its filing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to one source familiar with the matter.  The company had previously hoped to be in a position to begin its IPO roadshow as early as this week, Reuters has reported. Reflecting the uncertainty in its IPO plans, We Company�s $669 billion junk bond issued last year fell below par on Tuesday for the first time since announcing its IPO plans about a month ago. The 7.875% note due in May 2025 was down 2.5 cents on the dollar and the yield surged by 55 basis points to the highest since mid-August. While SoftBank and its Vision Fund emphasize their long-term investing credentials, founder and CEO Son has set out an ambitious IPO pipeline for tech investments spanning ride-hailing, fintech and health startups. The tech conglomerate has burned through much of the $100 billion raised by its first Vision Fund in just two years, recording big paper gains on internal revaluations of its tech investments as well as the sale of marquee investments including India�s Amazon Inc (AMZN.O) rival Flipkart.  SoftBank says its valuation techniques include cash-flow analysis, recent transactions and comparison with peers to underpin its numbers, but Son has won a reputation for intuitive bets and for doubling down on companies which have yet to generate hard results. SoftBank says many investments receive a vote of confidence as third parties come in as co-investors or by making follow-on investments at the same or higher valuations.  If a tech company shelves an IPO due to a lower valuation than expected, investors are generally expected to take that fall into account when appraising their stakes.

ONGC's stake in the project could rise to 93% if it converts share warrants and debentures into equity.",Reuters,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - India�s Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd plans to buy out the rest of a western Indian petrochemical project it does not already own and launch a public offering if it fails to find a strategic partner for it, its head of finance said on Tuesday. ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL), majority-owned by ONGC, is primarily a polymer manufacturer, a chemical compound used in everything from textiles to plastics and packaging. �We are looking at various options. Our first preference is to convert OPaL into a subsidiary by converting share warrants and debenture into equity if we don�t get a strategic partner,� Subhash Kumar, ONGC�s director of finance told Reuters. �Another option is to merge OPaL with ONGC.� ONGC will decide by the end of its fiscal year on whether to make OPaL a subsidiary, he said.  �After making it a subsidiary, it will take another two years to list the company,� Kumar said. ONGC has long tried to bring in a strategic partner in the petrochemical project but failed to strike a deal so far. Reuters reported here last year that Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), world's no. 4 petrochemical company, had shown interest in buying about half of the project. SABIC's Kuwait Petroleum Corp had also shown interest in buying a stake.  �Prospective partners had set certain terms for participation like selling petchem in their own brand,� Kumar said, citing reasons talks to sell a stake had not progressed.  He did not name any companies with whom ONGC had held talks.  ONGC�s stake in the project could rise to 70% if it converts 26 billion rupees of share warrants into equity and to about 93% if it also converted 77.78 billion rupees of debentures into shareholdings, Kumar said. ONGC owns 49.36% of the project and gas utility Gail (India) Ltd owns another 49.21%. The remaining stake is held by Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd, a state government-owned gas company, as of March. The petrochemical plant currently produces 1.1 million tonnes of ethylene, 400,000 tonnes of propylene and other products - most of which are building blocks for polymers - at Dahej in India�s western state of Gujarat.

Their joint statement, issued after a trade ministers� meeting in Bangkok, did not spell out any details of the review but said it aimed to make the agreement more �user-friendly and simple�. Hit by cheaper imports, small- and medium-scale industries in India, such as textile manufacturers and small farmers, have demanded the government take a fresh look at trade with ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. A panel of officials from India and ASEAN countries will work on the �details of the review and submit an update� at the next meeting, the statement said. India�s trade minister Piyush Goyal said in a tweet that the review will �help protect the interests of our industry & farmers, create jobs & boost �Make in India��.     � India�s trade deficit with ASEAN nations widened to $12.9 billion in 2017-18, from about $5 billion seven years ago.  The free trade pact, which initially excluded software and information technology, was signed in 2009 after more than six years of negotiations.  A powerful nationalist group tied to Prime Narendra Modi, which has long opposed a China-backed Asia-Pacific trade pact due to India�s trade deficit with ASEAN, said a review would �help in going towards a more equitable and balanced trade�.  The ministers also agreed to speed up the process of ratification of an ASEAN-India trade services agreement signed last year, the statement said.  The goods trade between India and ASEAN grew 9.8% to $80.8 billion in 2018 from the previous year, while foreign direct investment inflows to India from ASEAN members rose to $16.48 billion, nearly 37% of total inflows.

""[I]t definitely feels possible to play until I'm 40 if the hunger is still there,"" the 37-year-old said.",Cricket Country,"A calf injury forced James Anderson out of the Ashes but the England fast bowler seems to be in no mood of giving up cricket just yet. Instead, Anderson, 37, England�s leading Test wicket-taker, who is currently recovering from the injury is targetting the New Zealand Tests and is aiming to draw inspiration from none other than football legend Ryan Giggs.�It has been absolutely devastating to miss The Ashes series but I have not thought for one second about retiring. In fact, I�m going to look into how Ryan Giggs was able to play football at the highest level until he was 40. That�s what I�d like to do,� Anderson wrote in his column for The Sun.�I am meeting the physios and medical people this week to map out a programme to try to make sure I�m fit for the tour to New Zealand. The Test squad leaves on November 6. I�m 37 now, and it definitely feels possible to play until I�m 40, if the hunger is still there. And it certainly is at the moment.�Anderson admits he was frustrated with the growing list of injuries. He first injured his calf while playing for Lancashire and even though he had passed a fitness Test to be drafted in England�s Playing XI for the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston, the fast bowler pulled up after bowling just four overs in the first innings. Anderson eventually was ruled out of the tournament.�I really enjoyed playing for Lancashire in the first half of the summer before the calf injury. My bowling was as good as it�s been for a few years. I felt in great nick. As long as I�m bowling well with good energy, enthusiasm and desire, I�ll keep going,� he said.�That�s what made the injury so frustrating. I bowled loads for Lancashire with terrific rhythm and even played some one-day cricket for the county. My first-class bowling average was below ten. I have plenty in the tank especially after this last couple of months of rehab.�I feel stronger than I have for many years because of all the training and fitness work. Obviously, I need to get this calf sorted out. That�s my next priority. With the medics� help, I�ll investigate every possible avenue and get my muscles as strong as they can be.�Weighing in on the debate surrounding Joe Root and if he should continue as captain, Anderson backed the 30-year-old and reckoned the current England skipper is the right man to lead the team. Root has had a pretty ordinary series by his standards, scoring three half-centuries but also three ducks. Ben Stokes has emerged as a front-runner for the post given his shiny form but Anderson feels it�s too early to hand the allrounder a responsibility as big and crucial as captaincy.�Joe Root has had three ducks, that�s a big difference right there because Joe is the one we look to score the bulk of our runs. There are some mutterings about Joe�s future as captain. But I think he is doing a very good job,� Anderson said.�We�ve had a couple of tough years, especially since Cooky retired and we�ve been trying to find a couple of opening batsman. We�re going in the right direction and I think Joe is the man to lead us forward.�Who could take over anyway? Ben Stokes is a leader in the group and is doing a fantastic job as vice-captain. But giving him the captaincy might be a step too far. He has enough on his plate as batsman, bowler, fielder and leader in all formats.�",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/ryan-giggs-inspired-james-anderson-wants-to-play-till-40-889958?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Actor Tanushree Dutta, who is credited as the torch-bearer of the movement in the country, talked to Mid-Day in her latest interview and commented on Aamir�s decision. Tanushree said the actor has trivialised an important movement like #MeToo by taking a U-turn on his decision. She added that if Khan wanted to be fair thinking about the �livelihood� and �earning source�, he could have also hired the girl who accused Kapoor of sexually harassing her.The actor went on to add that a woman also loses job opportunities and faces more mental harassment and social pressure after she calls out a perpetrator, then why such sensitive acts of compassion are reserved only for men? She was quoted saying, �How come nobody in Bollywood has sleepless nights when a woman becomes a victim of abuse and is not able to work due to the trauma and ostracisation. If he (Aamir Khan) has agreed to hire this guy (Subhash Kapoor), why not hire the woman who suffered the consequences of his actions? Why do only the creepy men of Bollywood get compassion?

However, in an interview with Hindustan Times a few days back, the superstar revealed that he and his wife Kiran Rao decided to rethink their decision because they were reminded they are nobody to judge anyone before the court of law gives the judgement in the case.He was quoted saying, �Without an ICC ruling or a court ruling, how are we to decide whether the accused person is guilty or not. We were in this troubled state for many months. I couldn�t sleep at night because I used to constantly feel that my actions have inadvertently caused a person, about whose guilt I have absolutely no idea, to lose his right to work and earn a livelihood.�Aamir Khan (Photo Courtesy: IANS/ India.com)Elaborating on her stance, Tanushree said �compassion should be universal� and Bollywood�s bigwigs should be careful before displaying �selective compassion.� �It�s convenience and ignorance. Nobody bothered to ask me how I was doing when my livelihood was snatched away after the Horn Ok Pleasss (2009) harassment episode. No compassion for me, Aamir?� she asked.The actor, who is rumoured to be returning back on-screen soon, further said only a survivor knows what she has gone through and what she has lost seeing how the offender went on with his life as if nothing happened and things went back to normal for everyone else too.

During a four hour celebration in an 80,000-capacity stadium, Alibaba�s billionaire executive chairman delivered on his promise of a year ago to hand over to CEO Daniel Zhang. Costumed performers, some dancing to dubstep music and dressed in traditional Chinese dress, and singers paid tribute to Ma�s reputation for dressing up and performing at big events, entering to a parade of floats representing Alibaba divisions such as shopping site Tmall and payment service Ant Financial.  �After tonight I will start a new life. I do believe the world is good, there are so many opportunities, and I love excitement so much, which is why I will retire early,� Ma told guests and employees. Ma was spotted at one point welling up with tears as staff put on skits and sang songs, prompting the topic �Jack Ma has cried� to trend on Chinese social media platform Weibo.  Toward the end of the ceremony, Ma, co-founder Lucy Peng, and CEO of Alibaba�s technology committee Wang Jian donned rock star-style leather jackets and wigs to perform Chinese pop songs. They were joined by co-founder Joe Tsai dressed in Marilyn Monroe style white dress and a blonde wig.  Zhang, also clad in rock star garb, then delivered a solo, having earlier said that Alibaba would keep investing in areas such as cloud computing. Ma�s exit comes as Alibaba has grown to become Asia�s most valuable listed company, with a market capitalization of $460 billion. It employs over 100,000 people, and has expanded into financial services, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company also said on Tuesday that it had adopted six new core values, among which one was a pledge to �respect the work-life balance decisions of every individual�, marking a step away from Ma�s recent comments urging tech company employees to work nights and weekends, which sparked a nationwide debate.  Ma also told attendees that he hoped to see Alibaba shoulder more responsibility to improve society amid the sweeping changes brought about by technologies like big data and 5G.  �It is not easy to be a strong company, but it is more difficult to be a good company,� he said. �A strong company is determined by its commercial ability, while a good company is responsible and kind.�  (This story corrects name of Alibaba executive to Wang Jian in paragraph 6.)

The Apprente team will become the group's founding members and co-founder Itamar Arel will serve as vice-president. ""McDonald's commitment to innovation has long inspired our team. It was quite clear from our various engagements that McDonald's is leading the industry with technology"" said Itamar Arel, Ph.D., co-founder of Apprente and Vice President of McD Tech Labs. ""Apprente was borne out of an opportunity to use technology to solve challenging real world problems and we're thrilled to now apply this to creating personalized experiences for customers and crew.""

1991,"Swiggy to debut in payments with consumer wallet, UPI: Report","Bengaluru-based foodtech giant Swiggy has been working on launching its payment product for the past few months, including a consumer-facing wallet as well as UPI, Entrackr reported citing sources. ""The product is at least three-to-four months away from the official launch,"" Entrackr quoted a source as saying. Swiggy recently also launched its instant pick and drop logistics service 'Swiggy Go'.",Entrackr,"Swiggy has unarguably been one of the two largest tech-enabled transactional platforms in India along with Ola (excluding payments). The common reason between the duo � is evident � horizontal aspirations.Ola is eyeing several points of passengers transportation space while Swiggy is moving in the same direction in the hyperlocal delivery segment.The Naspers-backed firm does food delivery with other logistics tasks � fetching anything from supermarket via Swiggy Stores and regular retailers. It also launched Swiggy Go, a parcel moving service akin to dunzo for moving documents and other forms of parcels locally.What�s not common between the two companies? Payments. Ola has a wallet and while Swiggy doesn�t. According to three�Entrackr�s sources, Swiggy is ramping up for a consumer-facing wallet as well as UPI.�Swiggy has been working on launching its payment product for the past several months. The primary driver for having in-house payments is the growing scale with high repeat usages,� said two sources aware with the company�s plan on the condition of anonymity.�Entrackr couldn�t ascertain whether Swiggy has applied for PPI licence with regulators or not. It�s worth noting that Swiggy had already registered a virtual payment address (VPA) with handle @swiggy on UPI in partnership with ICICI bank.�So far, it was only used internally to pay delivery partners and critical associates/vendors. Our detailed queries to Swiggy remain unanswered. We will update the post as and when it responds.�Besides wallet, Swiggy will also bundle UPI option in its payments play. The product is at least three-to-four months away from the official launch,� added sources mentioned above. A year ago, its arch-rival Zomato was also planning to launch its payments service.�However, the Alipay-backed firm is yet to launch an in-house payments product.�Swiggy would be joining the likes of Amazon Pay that has turned into a regular UPI-based app. Like Paytm and Google Pay, it supports person to merchant and person to person payments. �Similar to Amazon Pay, the Swiggy will be integrating payments feature into the native-app. It won�t be a separate app like PhonePe,� emphasised sources.Swiggy is taking a leaf out of Go-Jek and playbook. �After Catering to several use cases � cabs, bikes, food delivery, among others, Go-Jek launched its own payments app Go-Pay. Similarly, Swiggy urged to have in-house payments product, especially, after Supr, Swiggy Stores and Go,� said sources.For the uninitiated, Supr is a portfolio company of Swiggy. It was acquired by the Bengaluru-based firm in the late last year.�Entrackr�had exclusively reported about�Supr acquisition�by the Sriharsha Majety-led venture and Swiggy�Go�separately.To drive adoption, Swiggy will be incentivising users for opting its in-house payments product. Just like Amazon does with Amazon Pay.Swiggy�s debut in the digital payments space with its in-house product would be exciting to watch out for. Not all attempts in payments by large companies fructified.

1993,"Uber fires 435 employees from product, engineering teams globally","Uber has confirmed the firing of 435 employees from its product and engineering teams worldwide. ""Previously, to meet the demands of a hyper-growth startup, we hired rapidly and in a decentralised way,"" Uber said, adding that it now wants to focus on ""lean, exceptionally high-performing teams."" This comes weeks after the ride-hailing giant fired 400 marketing employees globally.",TechCrunch,"Uber  has laid off 435 employees across its product and engineering teams, the company announced today. Combined, the layoffs represent about 8% of the organization, with 170 people leaving the product team and 265 people leaving the engineering team.The layoffs had no effect on Eats, which is one of Uber�s top-performing products, and Freight, according to a source familiar with the situation.Meanwhile, the company is lifting the hiring freeze on the product and engineering teams that has been in effect since early August, according to the source.�Our hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day to day � ruthlessly prioritizing, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility,� an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch. �While certainly painful in the moment, especially for those directly affected, we believe that this will result in a much stronger technical organization, which going forward will continue to hire some of the very best talent around the world.�Of those laid off, more than 85% are based in the U.S.; 10% are in Asia-Pacific and 5% are in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to the source.The layoffs came after Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi asked every member of his executive leadership team if they were to start from scratch, would their respective organizations look the way they do today?�After careful consideration, our Engineering and Product leaders concluded the answer to this question in many respects was �no,� � the spokesperson said.Those leaders are Chief Product Officer Manik Gupta and CTO Thuan Pham. They looked at team size, identified duplicate roles and overlapping work, as well as individual performance to determine who would be laid off, the source said. That�s how they landed on focusing more on the design and research teams from the product side.�Previously, to meet the demands of a hyper-growth startup, we hired rapidly and in a decentralized way,� the spokesperson said. �While this worked for Uber in the past, now that we have over 27,000 full-time employees in cities around the world, we need to shift how we design our organizations: lean, exceptionally high-performing teams, with clear mandates and the ability to execute faster than our competitors.�These layoffs come shortly after Uber laid off 400 people from its marketing team. In Q2 2019, Uber lost more than $5 billion � its biggest quarterly revenue loss to date � though a chunk of its losses were a result of stock-based compensation expenses for employees following the company�s IPO in May. While it may seem these layoffs are in response to those quarterly losses, Uber says the conversations have been ongoing.As Uber lays off its W-2 employees, it�s simultaneously investing in ensuring its 1099 independent contractors remain classified in that way. In light of gig worker protection bill AB-5 advancing through the California legislature, Uber, along with Lyft and DoorDash, put $30 million toward a 2020 ballot initiative that would enable them to keep their drivers as independent contractors. If AB-5 passes, Uber would see a significant uptick in costs.Uber is currently trading at $33.14 per share, well below its IPO pricing of $45.Here�s Uber�s full statement:Our CEO has asked everyone on our management team a simple but important question: if we started from scratch, would we design our organizations as they stand today? After careful consideration, our Engineering and Product leaders concluded the answer to this question in many respects was no. Previously, to meet the demands of a hyper-growth startup, we hired rapidly and in a decentralized way.While this worked for Uber in the past, now that we have over 27,000 full-time employees in cities around the world, we need to shift how we design our organizations: lean, exceptionally high-performing teams, with clear mandates and the ability to execute faster than our competitors.Today, we�re making some changes to get us back on track, which include reducing the size of some teams to ensure we are staffed appropriately against our top priorities. These were incredibly difficult calls as it means some of our employees no longer have a role, specifically around 170 people in our Product group and 265 people in Engineering, which is roughly 8 percent of those two orgs.Our hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day to day�ruthlessly prioritizing, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility.

Australia lead the five-match series 2-1 with one Test to go, meaning they are certain to retain the urn because they are the Ashes holders.ASHES 2019 FULL SCHEDULE | ASHES 2019 LATEST NEWSEngland�s failure has led to questions over Root�s position, particularly given his inconsistent batting throughout the series. But Australian Bayliss, who leaves his role after four years following this week�s final Test at the Oval, said there were no issues with his skipper.ALSO READ: Joe Root lacks any feel for captaincy � Geoffrey Boycott�He�s not come under question from anyone making any decisions,� Bayliss said. �He�s under no pressure at all.�Root, sixth in the world rankings, averages less than 31 in the series so far and has been dismissed for nought three times. Speaking about Root�s form with the bat, Bayliss added: �Everyone goes through periods where they don�t score as many runs as they�d like.�I think the Australian team have bowled pretty well to him, so we�ll see how things go further down the line. From my point of view, he was our premier batter and the Australians always try and target the opposition captain. He�s played well when he�s got starts and I don�t see too many problems.�After winning at Old Trafford to go 2-1 up in the series, Australia�s players celebrated on the field and were accused by some of mocking England spinner Jack Leach while doing so.�Fake news, like Donald Trump says,� said Bayliss. �No one has mentioned it or spoken about it. It�s all talk from you guys (the media).�Bayliss will return to Australia after the series, having spent four years in the job and taking England to World Cup glory in July.�On one hand I am sad to be leaving,� he said. �It�s been a fantastic environment to work in, everyone has made me feel at home. From a cricket sense we�ve had a lot of good performances, the cherry on top the World Cup win. But I am looking forward to getting home and it�s time for someone else to come in with a new voice.�Anderson backs RootInjured England pacer James Anderson said Root remained the best man to captain the side and would have the chance to forge a relationship with Bayliss�s successor.�He has done some great work,� he told the Press Association. �But the team has been developing over the last few years and going into a big series like this you want a settled team that�s fit and firing. I feel for Joe as he�s not quite had that. It�s been difficult.�Anderson, England�s all-time leading Test wicket-taker, said he had no intention of retiring despite an injury-ravaged season.�One of the big frustrations about not playing is seeing the guys out on the field,� he said. �It�s been great to see Jofra (Archer) taking to international cricket the way he has and Broady (Stuart Broad) has been fantastic all series. He�s shown his class all the way through.

2011,India hold Asian champs Qatar to goalless draw in FIFA WC Qualifier,India held Asian champions Qatar to a 0-0 draw in a Group E second round 2022 FIFA World Cup Qualifier match on Tuesday to earn their first point in the competition. Qatar failed to beat Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and score despite having 27 shots on target. Sandhu captained India in the match in Sunil Chhetri's absence.,The Quint,"A gritty India survived waves of attacks from Qatar to hold the reigning Asian champions to a goal-less draw to steal an unexpected point from their away match of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday.Despite playing without their talismanic captain Sunil Chhetri who was laid low by fever, the young Indians denied Qatar, who won the Asian Cup title in January, any goal despite the home side having more than one dozen shots on target.Also Read : Twitter Celebrates Gurpreet Sandhu�s Heroics in 0-0 Draw vs QatarIndian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, who also wore the captain's armband, was the star of the visiting side as he single-handedly stopped the Qataris from scoring any goal in the Group E match which will be remembered for long by the Indians.It was, no doubt, one of the best results by India in recent times.India, who had suffered a heartbreaking 1-2 loss to Oman in their opening match on September 5 in Guwahati, now have one point from two matches while Qatar have four points as they had beaten Afghanistan 6-0 in their first match here.India next play Bangladesh on October 15 in Kolkata.It was a completely one-sided match with Qatar doing all the attack and the Indians defending in their half for most part of the match.India, 103 in the latest FIFA rankings, on the other hand, had just two shots on the opposition goal in the entire match.To the credit of the Indians, they defended brilliantly, maintained their shape throughout and did not give space to the speedy Qatari attackers.In the first half, India expectedly sat deep and defended their citadel. The home side had at least half a dozen on-target shots and seven corners in the first half while India did not have any.Sandhu was a busy man as he was called into action several times but he remained unbeaten.Qatar captain Hassan Al-Haydos had two shots early into the match but Sandhu was upto the task, including the brilliant finger-tip save in the 20th minute. A mispass from Mandar Rao Desai in the 14th minute just outside the penalty box fell for Abdul Aziz Hatem, but his curling strike flew just above the crossbar.A free header off Boualem Khoukhi in the 26th minute was also off the target as India escaped unscathed in the first half.The second half saw India opening up a bit and they were seeing more of the opposition goal than the first half but still could not get a clear goal-bound shot. Sahal Samad was brilliant in the midfield as he, on a few occasions, got the better of his opponents and sent fine passes to the likes of Udanta Singh.India got their first corner in the 66th minute. Anirudha Thapa delivered a long corner and Sahal took a left-footed half volley from just outside the box which flew inches away from the right post.Igor Stimac made four changes to his side from the eleven that started in their 1-2 defeat against Oman. Chhetri was left out as he was suffering from fever. Ashique Kuruniyan has a slight niggle and therefore Nikhil Poojary took his place. Brandon Fernandes and Subhasish Bose were replaced by Sahal Samad and Mandar Rao Desai.(Hi there!

amiraculous escape as she accidentally fell off a moving jeep
on a road inside a dense forest here on, police said on

the child under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Act. The probe is on,"" an

Rights has also registered a case in this regard.  The child's father dismissed the allegation that
they wanted to abandon the kid and told media that he would
prove their innocence.   The girl child, sitting on her mother's lap, fell
off on Sunday night after her parents, exhausted by the
journey, had dozed off.   They had travelled several kilometres when they
realised that the child was missing, officials had said.  Wildlife officials at the check-post heard the
child's cries and found her on a forest path which is often

2025,Cristiano Ronaldo scores four goals as Portugal thrash Lithuania 5-1,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored four goals as Portugal defeated Lithuania 5-1 in their Euro 2020 qualifier match on Tuesday. With his four goals, Ronaldo took his international tally of goals to 93. It was Ronaldo's eighth hat-trick for Portugal and 54th of his professional career. Portugal are placed second in Group B with eight points, five behind leaders Ukraine.",Reuters,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo took his international tally to 93 goals when he scored four times to give the European champions a 5-1 win away to Lithuania in their Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday. Playing in his 161st international, the 34-year-old notched his eighth hat-trick for his country and the 54th of his remarkable career to help Portugal through what had threatened to turn into a frustrating evening. Unheralded midfielder William Carvalho completed the rout in stoppage time as Portugal stayed second in Group B with eight points, five behind leaders Ukraine with one game in hand. Serbia are a further point behind in third after a 3-1 win in Luxemburg. �I scored one goal against Serbia and four today and what I want most is to continue like this,� said Ronaldo, who converted an early penalty and then added three second-half goals. Portugal coach Fernando Santos said: �Ronaldo is the best player in the world, this is clear and unmistakable proof�. Lithuania, bottom with one point, missed an early chance when Vykintas Slivka fired over from close range and they quickly paid the price when Markus Palionis handled a Joao Felix cross and Ronaldo put away the spot kick in the fifth minute. Lithuania goalkeeper Ernestas Setkus made an excellent save to prevent Edvinas Girdvainis turning the ball into his own net but Vytautas Andriuskevicius then grabbed a surprise equaliser, rising above his marker to head home from a corner in the 28th. Ronaldo set up good chances for Felix and Bernardo Silva, which were wasted, after the break before taking matters into his own hands. Just as Portugal were beginning to show signs of frustration, Ronaldo produced a low shot which bobbled twice in front of Setkus in the 62nd minute. The Lithuania goalkeeper got his hand to it, but it hit his head and bounced into the net. Three minutes later, Ronaldo was left free in the area to sweep home Bernardo Silva�s cross and Silva also provided the pass for Ronaldo to sidefoot his fourth 11 minutes later. Carvalho�s goal, his fourth in 60 games, was a fitting reward for a player who keeps the Portugal midfield ticking over without getting much attention. �I�m convinced that these players are capable of finishing top of this group,� said Santos. Aleksandar Mitrovic scored twice to keep Serbia�s hopes alive with a win in Luxemburg. He headed Serbia in front after 36 minutes and Nemanja Radonjic curled in the second 10 minutes after the restart. Substitute David Turpel pulled one back and Serbia were on the ropes until Sergej Milinkovic-Savic produced a delightful reverse pass for Mitrovic to fire in the third.

2027,MIT researchers create programmable ink to let objects change colours,"Researchers at MIT have developed a new programmable ink that lets objects change colours when exposed to ultraviolet light. The 'PhotoChromeleon Ink' uses a mix of photochromic dyes that can be sprayed or painted onto the surface of any object, including shoes, cars or phone cases. The process can take about 15-40 minutes, depending on the shape of the object.",Engadget,"Imagine if, rather than buy your favorite shoes in blue or red, you could buy one pair of shoes and change the color depending on how you feel each day. Maybe you'd decide to add multicolored flames or zebra print. A new, reprogrammable ink might let you do just that. PhotoChromeleon Ink, developed by MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), can change the color or pattern of an object when exposed to UV light.The CSAIL team mixed cyan, magenta and yellow photochromic dyes into a solution that they spray on objects -- anything from shoes to cars, phone cases and toys. A coated object is then placed in a box with a projector and UV light. Users map the color or pattern they want into a program, which uses the UV light to activate and deactivate different colors. The colors last in natural light, and if you aren't happy with the design, you can use the UV light to erase it and start again. For objects the size of a shoe or a model car, the process can take between 15 and 40 minutes.""This special type of dye could enable a whole myriad of customization options that could improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce overall waste,"" said CSAIL postdoc Yuhua Jin, the lead author on a paper about the project. ""Users could personalize their belongings and appearance on a daily basis, without the need to buy the same object multiple times in different colors and styles.""To create PhotoChromeleon Ink (a play on its chameleon-like nature), the CSAIL team built off its previous ColorMod system, which 3D-printed items that can change color. Each pixel had to be individually printed, though, so the final result was low-resolution. And each pixel could only have two states (transparent and its own color), so color schemes were limited. In comparison, PhotoChromeleon Ink offers high resolution and a wide range of colors and patterns.The researchers still have work to do perfecting the colors of the dyes, but Ford, which helped fund the CSAIL project, has expressed interest in the ink. The company hopes it might one day cut down on the cost and time required to fabricate automotive parts. ""This ink could reduce the number of steps required for producing a multicolor part, or improve the durability of the color from weathering or UV degradation,"" said Dr. Alper Kiziltas, who specializes in sustainable and emerging materials at Ford. ""One day, we might even be able to personalize our vehicles on a whim.""",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/mit-csail-reprogrammable-ink-changes-color/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I looked at Steve Smith who shot a glance that said...'Ooh, you shouldn't have said that',"" Cook added.",CricTracker,"When it comes to knowing how Australian players behave on the field and what they do to win games, there are very few players who know it better than the England players. Both the teams are the oldest rivals in the game and give it their all to win the iconic Ashes.� Former England skipper Alastair Cook has now revealed some startling details about David Warner�s conduct on the field in his autobiography.Having played as many as seven Ashes series, Cook is well familiar with the Australian culture and the players. The legendary batsman, in his book, has revealed Warner once ended up telling him how he used substances attached to the strapping on his hand to change the condition of the ball during a first-class match. Warner could have perhaps ended up telling more had Steve Smith not intervened in time.Advertisement�David Warner, a couple of beers into his celebration, mentioned that he used substances attached to the strapping on his hand to accelerate the deterioration of the ball during a first-class match. I looked at Steve Smith who shot a glance that said: �Ooh, you shouldn�t have said that,� wrote Alastair Cook while he recalled the players sharing beers after the 2017-18 Ashes.Well, Warner and Smith did land in trouble after being caught red-handed trying to tamper with the ball in the Cape Town Test last year. Both the players received a one-year ban and made their comeback to Tests in the ongoing Ashes.Alastair Cook further said that Australian players went too far to maintain their culture of �win at all cost�. While he did not accuse them of cheating directly but subtly made his intentions clear.�Stuart Broad sums it up pretty well and says they got the ball to reverse swing in that Ashes. Why change what you�ve been doing? Why suddenly use sandpaper? People know what was going on. But it�s been the best thing for Australian cricket because they realised it wasn�t acceptable. The win-at-all-costs culture they created isn�t what the Australian public needed or wanted. They�d gone too far,� Cook was quoted as saying by The Guardian.Since the ball-tampering scandal, Australia have ditched their win-at-all-cost culture in order to win back the fans. Current coach Justin Langer has changed the dressing room culture which has seen the Australian players mellow down on the field in recent times.",https://www.crictracker.com/david-warner-told-me-how-he-accelerated-the-deterioration-of-the-ball-during-a-fc-match-alastair-cook/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The toll of casualties is not final, officials added. The stampede reportedly occurred when one pilgrim tripped, while thousands of others were performing a ritual.",Reuters,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - At least 31 people died and another 102 were wounded on Tuesday during the Shi�ite Muslim religious rituals of Ashura in Iraq�s southern holy city of Kerbala, in what officials at its Imam Hussein shrine described as a stampede. The death toll released by the Iraqi Health Ministry was expected to rise, with at least nine people still in critical condition. Thirty people died on site and one more died in hospital, the Health Ministry spokesman said. The ministry did not disclose how they had been killed but shrine officials told Reuters the stampede took place towards the end of the procession, when thousands of pilgrims rushed towards the shrine during what is known as the Tuwairij run.   �The pilgrims fell one on top of the other and we were unable to pull them out,� pilgrim Abdel Mahdi told Reuters. Photographs circulated on social media showed dozens of people bloodied and lying across a walkway, while other pilgrims attempted to help. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi expressed his condolences to those killed in the stampede, while the Health Minister visited the wounded in hospital.  The annual pilgrimage marking the death of the Prophet Mohammed�s grandson Hussein in battle in 680 draws hundreds of thousands of Shi�ite Muslims to Kerbala from around the world. Hussein�s death in a battle at Kerbala over the leadership of the Islamic community is one of the defining events in the schism between Shi�ite and Sunni Muslims. The rituals commemorating the death of Hussein involve self-flagellation, with crowds of mourners striking themselves and some lacerating their heads with blades. Stampedes have occurred in the past.

2043,"Germany says it can pump 'many, many billions' into economy","Germany has said it's ready to pump ""many, many billions of euros"" into its economy to counter any significant growth slowdown. Germany's economy contracted 0.1% in the April-June quarter. ""It'll be very important for us as the largest economy in the middle of the EU, whether we're actually able to counteract a negative economic trend,"" Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said.",Reuters,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is ready to pump �many, many billions of euros� into its economy to counter any significant slowdown in growth and the country must take bold measures to fight climate change before it�s too late, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday. Scholz�s remarks are his strongest hint yet that Berlin is ready to loosen the purse strings to fight any downward economic spiral and come just two days before the European Central Bank is expected to unleash a cocktail of stimulus measures to give the ailing euro zone economy a boost. Speaking to lawmakers during a general budget debate in the lower house of parliament, Scholz said Germany was in a position to do more if an economic crisis hits thanks to its solid budget planning and rigid policy of not taking on new debt. �It will be very important for us as the largest economy in the middle of the European Union, whether we are actually able to counteract a negative economic trend,� Scholz said. �With the solid financial foundations we have today, we are in a position to counter an economic crisis with many, many billions of euros, if one actually breaks out in Germany and Europe,� Scholz said. German 30-year government bond yields climbed into positive territory on Tuesday for the first time since August on expectations of increased borrowing before slipping back below zero. Scholz�s comments also followed a Reuters report on Monday that said Berlin may set up independent public bodies to take on new debt and boost investment in key parts of the economy, without falling foul of strict national spending rules. Germany�s economy contracted 0.1% in the second quarter and weak data since has fuelled concerns that Europe�s biggest economy could shrink again between July and September and tip the country into recession for the first time since 2013. Exporters have long been the driver of Germany�s economic growth but they are struggling in the face of a global slowdown, rising trade tensions and growing uncertainty about Britain�s chaotic exit from the European Union. In his speech to lawmakers, Scholz said climate change had reached a threatening level and the ruling coalition must come up with bold measures to reduce carbon emissions as promised and fight rising global temperatures. �Now it�s the 11th hour,� he said. �We will not get away with small measures. We really need to push the reset button.� Chancellor Angela Merkel�s conservatives and Scholz�s centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) are working on a comprehensive package of climate protection measures that are likely to put a massive burden on the federal budget. Sources familiar with internal government discussions have told Reuters any new debt taken on by independent public investment agencies would fund spending on infrastructure and climate protection projects. Merkel and Scholz are expected to seal the climate package on Sept. 20 together with SPD Environment Minister Svenja Schulze and conservative Economy Minister Peter Altmaier. In the parliamentary debate on Tuesday, Altmaier said Germany should reduce its carbon emissions by implementing market-oriented measures rather than imposing bans. The climate package is likely to include a wider pricing mechanism for carbon emissions and payouts for low-income families to cushion the impact of the new measures. Altmaier also promoted his idea of a non-profit climate foundation into which Berlin could initially inject 5 billion euros. The foundation would issue interest-free loans for climate protection projects - up to a maximum of 50 billion euros - with the aim of reducing German carbon emissions. That�s roughly the amount needed to finance the additional climate protection measures the government is considering. Altmaier has said any borrowing or lending through such a non-profit foundation would not violate the federal government�s self-imposed balanced budget goal - or its more formal debt brake - because the foundation would be private.

2067,"You can tie my hands, but I will not delay Brexit: UK PM","Refusing to delay Brexit any further, UK PM Boris Johnson said, ""No matter how many devices this Parliament invents to tie my hands, I'll strive to get an agreement in the national interest...This government will not delay Brexit."" Johnson added that his government will strive to negotiate a deal while preparing to leave without one.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday he would not request an extension to Brexit, hours after a law came into force demanding that he delay Britain�s departure from the European Union until 2020 unless he can strike a divorce deal. For the second time in a week, lawmakers then rejected Johnson�s request to try to break the deadlock through an early national election.  With the future of Brexit mired in uncertainty, parliament was suspended until Oct. 14, sparking tense scenes in the House of Commons where opposition lawmakers held signs reading �silenced� and yelled �shame on you� at Johnson�s ruling Conservatives. Johnson appeared to have lost control of Britain�s withdrawal from the European Union with the approval of the law, which obliges him to seek a delay unless he can strike a new deal at an EU summit next month.  EU leaders have repeatedly said they have not received specific proposals ahead of an EU summit on Oct. 17 and 18, at which Johnson says he hopes he can secure a deal.  �This government will press on with negotiating a deal, while preparing to leave without one,� Johnson told parliament after the result of the vote on an early election.  �I will go to that crucial summit on October the 17th and no matter how many devices this parliament invents to tie my hands, I will strive to get an agreement in the national interest ... This government will not delay Brexit any further.�  Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the party was eager for an election, but would not support Johnson�s move to hold one until it was certain a delay to Brexit had been secured. �As keen as we are, we are not prepared to risk inflicting the disaster of no-deal on our communities,� Corbyn said. Brexit, the United Kingdom�s most significant geopolitical move in decades, remains in question more than three years since the 2016 referendum, with possible outcomes ranging from an exit on Oct. 31 without a withdrawal agreement to smooth the transition, to abandoning the whole endeavour. The bill seeking to block a no-deal exit, passed into law on Monday when it received assent from Queen Elizabeth, will force Johnson to seek a three-month extension to the Oct. 31 deadline unless parliament has either approved a deal or consented by Oct. 19 to leave without one. Responding to concerns the government could ignore the legislation, Foreign Minister Dominic Raab earlier told parliament that the government would respect the rule of law but added, �Sometimes it can be more complex because there are conflicting laws or competing legal advice.� Johnson took over as prime minister in July after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed to push the Withdrawal Agreement through parliament. Parliament returned from its summer break last week, and Johnson has lost all six votes held in the House of Commons since. The suspension of parliament, or prorogation, will last for five weeks.  Under Johnson�s premiership, Britain�s three-year Brexit crisis has stepped up a gear, leaving financial markets and businesses bewildered by an array of political decisions that diplomats compare to the style of U.S. President Donald Trump. BlackRock, a U.S. investment firm that manages $6.8 trillion of assets, said a no-deal Brexit or a referendum had become more plausible.   The pound trimmed gains against the dollar, to stand slightly higher on Monday at $1.234. It jumped to a six-week high of $1.2385 in London trading after economic data beat forecasts. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, champion of parliament in its move to rein in the prime minister over Brexit, took a veiled swipe at Johnson as he announced on Monday he would stand down from the role, issuing a warning to the government not to �degrade� parliament. As Bercow tried to suspend parliament on Monday night, well after midnight, a brief scuffle broke out near his chair as opposition lawmakers held up signs and booed.  �This is not a normal prorogation,� Bercow said. �It is not typical, it is not standard. It is one of the longest for decades and it represents not just in the minds of some colleagues but huge numbers of people outside, an act of executive fiat,� he told a raucous chamber.   Johnson, a former journalist who derided the EU and later became the face of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, has repeatedly promised to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31.  Ireland told Johnson on Monday that he must make specific proposals on the future of the Irish border if there was to be any hope of averting a no-deal departure, saying Dublin could not rely on simple promises. �In the absence of agreed alternative arrangements, no backstop is no deal for us,� Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, standing beside Johnson, told reporters. �We are open to alternatives, but they must be realistic ones, legally binding and workable, and we haven�t received such proposals to date.�  Varadkar�s blunt remarks indicate the difficulty of Johnson�s gamble of using the threat of a no-deal exit to convince Germany and France that they must rewrite an exit pact struck last November. �I want to find a deal, I want to get a deal,� Johnson said in Dublin, adding that there was plenty of time to find one before the October EU summit. The law that took effect on Monday does allow for one scenario in which a no-deal Brexit could take place on Oct. 31 - if parliament approved a no-deal exit by Oct. 19.  However the current parliament would be unlikely to switch stance and approve a no-deal exit by then. Lawmakers voted 311 to 302 on Monday to demand the government publish documents over its planning for a no-deal Brexit and private communications from government officials involved in a decision to suspend parliament. Those calling for the documents to be published say they will show the decision to suspend parliament was politically motivated, as a way to limit discussion on Brexit. The government said the suspension was to give Johnson the chance to set out a new legislative agenda.

It is expected to be commissioned in 2025.",Reuters,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - India�s planned giant refinery and petrochemical project, which is being built with Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), will cost more than the originally planned $45 billion, India�s oil minister said on Tuesday. The 1.2 million barrels-per-day (bpd) giant coastal project is part of India�s plans to raise its refining capacity by 77% to 8.8 million bpd by 2030. It is being built at Roha, around 100 km (62 miles) south of Mumbai. �The primary plan was around $45 billion, it will be more than that,� Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters at the World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi, declining to say by how much. Sources told Reuters last month that India had increased the cost estimate of the project by more than 36% after protests by farmers forced its relocation. The project is expected to cost $60 billion, sources told Reuters at the time, but is still expected to be commissioned in 2025. Pradhan confirmed the commissioning date and said other issues are progressing, without elaborating. Global oil producers are vying to gain entry into India to establish a stable outlet for their output and to earn profit from the South Asian nation�s strong gasoline and petrochemical demand prospects due to the rising disposable income of its 1.3 billion population.

In 2018, Australia became the first country to ban Huawei from providing equipment for its 5G network citing national security risks.

Officials from anti-cyberespionage body the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) were asked about an Australian ban on using the Chinese technology giant to build 5G networks when a delegation visited New Delhi last week, The Australian Financial Review and The Australian reported. �Indian officials were keen to get an understanding of how the Turnbull government arrived at the decision to ban Huawei, and multiple discussions have been held over the matter,� the AFR said, referring to a move led former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2018. The delegation last week, led by Australian ambassador for cyber affairs Tobias Feakin, �explained in detail why high-risk vendors had been banned from Australia�s 5G network,� The Australian reported.

2080,"QuintoAndar raises $250 mn in round by SoftBank, becomes 'unicorn'","Brazilian real estate startup QuintoAndar has raised $250 million in Series D round of funding led by SoftBank. The round has taken the company ""to unicorn status"", according to CEO Gabriel Braga, although he did not disclose its exact valuation. QuintoAndar had raised about $64 million in Series C, bringing their total amount raised to about $345 million so far.",TechCrunch,"QuintoAndar,  the Brazilian real estate technology developer, has secured a massive $250 million Series D led by SoftBank,  as the Japanese conglomerate continues to deploy its $5 billion commitment to the Latin American region. The round is the latest sign that startups in Latin America can get money if they�re developing technologies in specific areas that are massive pain points for the geography�s nascent middle class.QuintoAndar invented a marketplace that lets users search, book, rent and advertise rental properties in Brazil. The site manages listings and visits, as well as transaction processing between tenants and landlords, and houses the digital contracts that bind these agreements. QuintoAndar also developed a credit analysis system that negates the need for co-signers, deposits and rental insurance � barriers that have historically blocked deal flow in this industry. Co-founder and CEO Gabriel Braga says QuintoAndar has now entered unicorn territory thanks to the SoftBank-led round. Dragoneer also participated, as well as return investors General Atlantic and Kaszek (which recently announced a fresh $600 million fund of its own).�QuintoAndar, which translates from Portuguese to English as �fifth floor,� is an example of a Brazilian startup solving Brazilian problems. Those seeking long-term rentals in big cities like S�o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are throttled by bureaucratic policies that enforce expensive deposits, co-signer requirements and skyscraper-high insurance fees. On the supply side, amateur landlords are tunnel-visioned on making money from transactions, which creates a terrible customer service experience for tenants, along with wasted hours of apartment hunting. QuintoAndar is billing itself as a modernized fix that lets users search, book, rent and advertise rental properties in Brazil.�The startup, which has grown into a 1,000 person S�o Paulo-based operation, has now amassed a total of $345 million to date, including a $64 million Series C led by General Atlantic that closed just nine months ago. Braga declined to confirm the exact valuation of QuintoAndar, but says that it has crossed the threshold of billion-dollar status. The company was founded in 2013.�Why is this long-term rentals startup accumulating so much capital? Brazilians are seeing home ownership as less of a long-term goal and are opting to rent, meaning more money in the bank and freedom to relocate. This, the founder believes, creates a big opportunity to make renting more efficient in a country where 62% of Brazilians are aged 29 or under, according to this review. Brazil�s population of 211,000,000 people has proven a hungry enough market for a startup like QuintoAndar to turn profitable, and to attract foreign investors like SoftBank. Co-founders Andr� Penha and Braga were able to leverage these massive foreign investment checks to create a specific product to help generate liquidity for users in its home market.�Brazilian long-term rentals service QuintoAndar raises $64M Series CBraga says the company doesn�t measure success by volume of users or its newly minted unicorn status, but by number of property visits carried out on QuintoAndar. The company is projecting over 2 million visits scheduled through its platform in 2019, and is seeing 4,500 contracts signed per month. The CEO attributes QuintoAndar�s popularity to its ease of use, and the fact that the renting service is generating liquidity for brokers and sellers in the Brazilian long-term rentals market.�With the new funding, Braga intends to strengthen QuintoAndar�s user base by acquiring new customers in more cities across Brazil. The company also intends to attract new talent and build out broker partnerships. In the long term, QuintoAndar envisions launching more financial products for its customers, and eventually using its suite of data to make recommendations for services like home renovations.�QuintoAndar now joins Nubank, Loggi, Gympass and Stone in the growing club of billion-dollar Brazilian tech companies, but its founder is more interested in keeping the momentum going than celebrating entrance into the Latin American unicorn club. �I�m more focused on the long-term mission that we have, and not overly excited about being a unicorn. Tomorrow�s another day, we have to keep working,� says Braga.�",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/softbank-mints-quintoandar-a-new-unicorn-in-latin-american-real-estate-tech/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The Riverdale�actor, who attended New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts, shared that she was drugged and sexually assaulted during her freshman year, reported Us Weekly.In her cover story for Women's Health, the 25-year-old actor reflected upon the dark period in her life, explaining that she got her ""to build a home"" tattoo above her rib after that first year at college. ""I got the tattoo after my freshman year,"" she said in her interview with the magazine, referring to the tattoo above her rib.""I had a very, very bad experience. I was roofied by someone who sexually assaulted me,"" she added. The actor noted that the tattoo worked as a reminder to ""strengthen both her sense of self and the environment around her."" Nowadays, when Mendes is going through a rough phase, she ponders about what she would do ""physically for myself.""""Whenever I feel like I'm going through something difficult, I think about what I can do physically for myself,"" she explained. ""I danced for seven years, from age 4 to 11. Then I did musicals as a kid, then so much of acting school is movement classes and connecting your breath to your body. Activity has always been an important part of my life,"" she added.However, Mendes also noted that it's important to give your body rest, even if that means giving up a day in the gym. ""People sometimes put working out first and don't give their bodies rest. I'll always choose sleep first. I think it's just so underrated,"" she shared.The actor, who rose to fame playing Veronica Lodge on The CW series Riverdale, also addressed her struggles with bulimia in the cover story. ""I've only recently gotten better,"" Mendes said, adding that she's been helped by professionals. ""I needed professionals I trusted to tell me things that I didn't know,"" the 'Perfect Date' actor confessed.Mendes, who has become a role model to so many fans, is helping those who follow her to speak out about their own struggles. ""When I was a teenager, there were no role models when it came to body positivity--that simply was not a thing. Being thin was the thing,"" Mendes shared.Mendes said that she aims to be the type of role model she wished she had when she was growing up. ""It's health that's important, not appearance. I make choices that are good for me--and not just in my body--but for my soul, for my mind. And sometimes that's eating ice cream because I want to eat ice cream,"" she said.Last month, Mendes and her co-star Charles Melton, who plays Reggie on 'Riverdale', celebrated their first anniversary. Mendes told the magazine that she's currently ""living on such a high.""

""I am of the view that the matter requires investigation in detail,"" said the judge.",The Wire,"New Delhi:�A Delhi court on Monday granted relief from arrest to Jammu and Kashmir People�s Movement leader Shehla Rashid, who has been�booked for sedition�for tweeting that the armed forces allegedly tortured civilians and ransacked houses in the Valley after Jammu and Kashmir�s special status was revoked.In his order, additional sessions judge Pawan Kumar Jain at Patiala House court granted interim protection from arrest to Rashid. He wrote: �I am of the view that the matter requires investigation in detail� and posted it next for November 5. Till then, he ordered that the �accused shall not be arrested�.However, he directed that she would �join the investigation� as and when called by the investigation officer.Case pertains to tweets on J&K situationEarlier, Rashid�s counsel, senior advocate Satish Tamta, urged the court for interim protection on the ground that she had shared some information on her Twitter (account) on August 17 this year pertaining to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.He submitted before the court that �on the basis of her comments, one advocate made a complaint to the Special Cell (of Delhi Police) and on the basis of said complaint, police has registered an FIR�. The counsel also stated the sections under which the case has been registered.Army has not filed a complaint, no notice issued to RashidThereafter the additional public prosecutor submitted that till date, the police has not even issued any notice to the accused. Tamta thereafter stated that Rashid was ready to join the investigation and cooperate with the police.ASJ Jain also recorded that the prosecutor had stated that the police has thus far not received any complaint from the Indian Army. After he said that the police would need at least six weeks to investigate the complaint, the judge posted the matter to November 5.Case filed on complaint of SC lawyerThis case has once again highlighted how the serious provision of sedition is used arbitrarily to silence complaints and voices of dissent.In this case, while Rashid has been accused of making false accusations against the army, the fact of the matter, as submitted by a counsel before the court, is that the army has not made a complaint till date.SC judge spoke against using sedition at �drop of a hat�Just two days back, speaking on the law of sedition in India�at an event, Justice Deepak Gupta of the Supreme Court spoke of how even the preamble of India�s constitution provides that �there cannot be any democratic polity where citizens do not have the right to think as they like, express their thoughts, have their own beliefs and faith, and worship in a manner which they feel like.�On the necessity for freedom of opinion, he said, �If a person does not ask questions and does not raise issues questioning age old systems, no new systems would develop and the horizons of the mind will not expand.��Sedition introduced by British to deprive people of rights, curb independence demand�As for law of sedition, he said, it must be kept in mind that it was �introduced at a time when we were ruled by a foreign imperialist colonising power� and that �their sole aim was to deprive the people of this country of their rights including the right to express their views.�Stating that �the British used the law of sedition to curb any demand for independence�, Justice Gupta added that, �the offence as defined by the first clause is exciting or attempting to excite feelings of disaffection to the government.��Law of sedition needs to be toned down�In the present day, he said, the law of sedition needs to be toned down � if not abolished altogether � and that the least which the government can do is to make it a non-cognizable offence so that the persons are not arrested at the drop of a hat.�And he added that �criticism of the government by itself cannot amount to sedition. In a country which is governed by the rule of law and which guarantees freedom of speech, expression and belief to its citizens, the misuse of the law of sedition and other similar laws is against the very spirit of freedom for which the freedom fighters fought and gave up their lives.�Rashid too had called charges �frivolous�, an �attempt to silence� herIt may be noted that�Rashid had described the charge�levelled against her as �frivolous, politically motivated and a pathetic attempt to silence� her. Apart from sedition, she was also charged with spreading �fake news� with the intention to �malign the image of the Indian Army�.The case was filed in connection with a series of tweets made by her on August 17. In these, Rashid had alleged that the armed forces entered houses in Kashmir at night and �ransacked� them. She had also alleged that four men were called to an Army camp in Shopian and �interrogated (tortured)�.Rashid even offered proof of allegationsFollowing her tweets, a�Supreme Court lawyer, Alakh Alok Srivastava, filed a complaint with Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik accusing the former JNU student leader of making �absolutely false and concocted� allegations.The complaint was forwarded to Special Cell and Rashid was booked, apart from other sections, for under section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code as well.Standing by her comments, Rashid had stated that she could even furnish proof if the Indian army was to initiate an inquiry into her claims. It is �important to put out narratives of the people, so that people in the rest of India know what is happening there,� she added.",https://thewire.in/rights/court-grants-protection-from-arrest-to-shehla-rashid-sedition-case?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2089,Smith accused of mocking Leach by wearing spectacles during celebrations,"Australia batsman Steve Smith has been accused of mocking England spinner Jack Leach by wearing spectacles while celebrating his team's victory in the fourth Ashes Test. A journalist also claimed that Smith also mocked Leach's batting style in the team huddle. Leach had remained unbeaten on 1 while batting at number 11 in the third Ashes Test, which England won.",CricTracker,"Former Australia captain Steve Smith found himself at the receiving end in the UK for a long time this summer. The talented batsman was taunted and booed whenever he went out to bat after returning from a year-long ban post Sandpapergate last year. He was booed before the�World Cup�and then when the showpiece event started. However, it was for the Ashes series following the World Cup that Smith had kept his best for.Starting with hundreds in each innings of his comeback Test, Smith kept on dominating the series and despite missing the third Test at Headingley, he amassed 671 runs in three Tests. Smith scored 211 and 82 in the fourth Test to give Australia a crucial win that ensured that they retain the urn. The Baggy Greens won the fourth Test at Old Trafford by 185 runs on Sunday to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the five-match series with one match to go. They had won the first Test at Edgbaston by 251 runs and Smith was the hero on that occasion as well.AdvertisementOn Sunday, after overpowering the English resistance, Australia were back to the ground after the presentation ceremony to celebrate and there, Test No.1 batsman in Tests did something unique. He put on a pair of glasses apparently to mock England�s tail-ending batsman�Jack Leach. The bespectacled cricketer became an overnight hero after holding on at one end to assist Ben Stokes in winning the third Test in Leeds.The duo added unbeaten 76 runs for the final wicket to give their side a sensational victory. England were so ecstatic with the win that on Stokes� request, official sponsors of the series Specsavers decided to give Leach free glasses for the rest of his life as a token of acknowledgment of his heroics. The southpaw did his best to deny Australia a win in Manchester as well by scoring 12 off 51 at No.10 but he wasn�t successful.That Smith�s relationship with England saw little improvements during the series was visible when former England seamer�Steve Harmison�said despite his heroics, Smith will be remembered as a cheat.",https://www.crictracker.com/steve-smith-sports-glasses-after-old-trafford-win-apparently-to-mock-leeds-hero-jack-leach/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The funding was raised from Peter Thiel and Ajay Royan's investment firm Mithril Capital. InMobi Co-founder and CEO Naveen Tewari said that the current round has not closed and could bag another $30-55 million in the next two months.",TechCrunch,"Glance, a subsidiary of Indian mobile ad business firm InMobi,  said today it has raised $45 million as it prepares to scale its business outside of India and bulk up its product offerings.The unnamed maiden financing round for Glance was funded by Mithril Capital, a growth-stage investment firm co-founded by Silicon Valley investors Peter Thiel and Ajay Royan.In an interview with TechCrunch, Naveen Tewari, founder and CEO of InMobi Group, said the current round has not closed and could bag another $30 million to $55 million in the next two months.Glance operates an eponymous service that shows media content in local languages on the lock screen of Android-powered smartphones. InMobi has partnered with a number of top smartphone vendors, including Xiaomi, Samsung and Gionee, to integrate Glance into their respective operating systems.Glance, which was launched in September last year and supports English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu, has amassed 50 million monthly active users in India, its primary market. Users are spending an average of 22 minutes with Glance each day, he said.�All the new smartphone models launched by Samsung, Xiaomi and a handful of other vendors have launched with Glance on them,� Tewari said.In a statement, Mithril Capital�s Royan said, �We share Glance�s global vision of breaking through the constraints of application architectures and linguistic markets to deliver rich, frictionless, and engaging experiences across a myriad of cultures and languages.� As part of the financing round, he is joining Glance�s board.Glance does not show traditional ads, something it intends to never change, but shows a certain kind of content to drive engagement for brands.In the months to come, Glance plans to expand the platform and bring short-form videos (Glance TV), and mini games (Glance Games) to the lock screen. It is also working on a feature dubbed Glance Nearby that will enable brands to court users in their vicinity, and Glance Shopping to explore ways to build commerce around content.As of today, InMobi Group is not monetizing Glance platform, but plans to explore ways to make money from it early next year, Tewari said.The 12-year-old firm said it plans to expand footprints of Glance outside of India. The company plans to take Glance to some Southeast Asian markets like Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. InMobi�s Tewari said Glance has already started to find users in these markets.InMobi Group, which had raised $320 million prior to today�s financing round, has been profitable for several years, but the company decided to raise outside funding to accelerate Glance�s growth, Tewari said.The firm, which has three subsidiaries, including its marquee marketing cloud division, plans to go public in the next few years. But instead of taking the entire group public, Tewari said the firm is thinking of publicly listing each division as they mature. The marketing cloud division, which brings in the vast majority of revenue for the firm, will go public first, he said.�The IPO plans remain, and we will evaluate them as we go along. The reality, however, is that the market is so big and there is so much room that we can continue to be private for a few more years,� he said.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/inmobi-glance/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2097,US extracted CIA spy close to Putin: Reports,"The US in 2017 extracted a CIA spy who was close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, reports quoting US officials said. He was reportedly extracted after US President Donald Trump shared classified information with the Russians. The spy was crucial in providing information that led US intelligence to conclude Putin had directly ordered Russian meddling in 2016 US presidential elections.",RT,"US intelligence �successfully extracted from Russia one of its highest-level covert sources inside the Russian government� in mid-2017, the network reported citing anonymous sources described as �multiple Trump administration officials with direct knowledge� of the secret mission.CNN Exclusive: The US extracted one of its top spies from Russia in 2017, worried about exposure and Trump�s handling of intelligence: https://t.co/zKiY4VwO3CThe operation was supposedly launched after the May 2017 visit to the White House of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, over concerns that Trump and his administration �repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy,� in CNN�s words.During the meeting Trump reportedly shared with Lavrov and Kislyak �highly classified intelligence� about Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Syria, provided by Israel. The CIA challenged that claim, however.�CNN's narrative that the Central Intelligence Agency makes life-or-death decisions based on anything other than objective analysis and sound collection is simply false,� said Brittany Bramell, the CIA director of public affairs. �Misguided speculation that the President's handling of our nation's most sensitive intelligence�which he has access to each and every day�drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate.��That seemed to be good enough for Trump himself, who told reporters on Monday that �whatever the CIA responded [with] is fine with me. I know nothing.�However, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that �CNN's reporting is not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger.��Media outlets in Russia immediately began speculating as to the identity of the alleged mole, quickly settling on Oleg Smolenkov. Before 2010 he worked at the Russian embassy in Washington and then at the presidential administration, before becoming state councillor of the third class. Smolenkov took his wife and three children on vacation to Montenegro on July 14, 2017, whereupon they vanished without a trace. The police have been investigating their disappearance as possible murder.Russian media think they've identified the top Russian spy that CNN says the US exfiltrated from #Russia in 2017. This 2017 article describes Oleg Smolenkov, an official in the presidential administration who mysteriously vanished with his entire family. https://t.co/VscTwJ4lnJThe story about a high-level US �mole� in the Kremlin reads like a plot of a Tom Clancy novel and relies on anonymous sources and classified information, so it cannot be independently verified.�Russian Senator Franz Klintsevich, deputy head of the Defense and Security Committee, dismissed CNN�s story as �fake� and �carrying out orders for another attempt to discredit Trump,� according to TASS.Most of the US mainstream media outlets spent the past three years promoting the notorious �Russiagate� conspiracy theory on behalf of the Democrats, and have refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing even though special counsel Robert Mueller failed to find anything to incriminate the president after a two-year investigation.�Moreover, CNN and MSNBC have hired a number of former intelligence officials, whose fingerprints have been all over �Russiagate,� as anti-Trump pundits.CNN should have CNN analysts Andrew McCabe and Jim Clapper weigh in on the story about the exfiltration of Kremlin mole. https://t.co/4yJ3tRMsf6Journalist Aaron Mate called the whole thing �fishy,� noting that there is a history of leaks from the intelligence community to �create a false link� between Trump and Russia, advance the �Russiagate� narrative, and then blame Trump for the supposed vulnerability of these alleged sources....the obvious question is: what is the actual agenda of the intel officials leaking false and/or misleading information, & why are some prominent journalists carrying their water, instead of asking this obvious question?Think your friends would be interested?

2098,N Korea fires projectiles after offer to resume talks with US,"North Korea fired a new round of short-range projectiles on Tuesday, hours after it offered to resume talks with the US over the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. The launches were detected by South Korea. North Korea has demanded an end to US sanctions as well as an end to US-South Korea military exercises for the talks to go forward.",Reuters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired a new round of short-range projectiles on Tuesday, South Korean officials said, only hours after it signalled a new willingness to resume stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States. The launches were detected early in the morning by the South Korean military, which said they appeared to be short-range projectiles. The launches came hours after Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said in a statement carried by state media that North Korea was willing to have �comprehensive discussions� with the United States in late September at a time and place to be agreed. Choe warned that the United States needed to present a new approach or the talks could fall apart again. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said she did not have any talks to announce at that time. Shares of South Korean construction firms with exposure to North Korea surged after the announcement that North Korea was willing to restart talks with the United States and continued to gain despite the latest launches. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met at the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas in June and agreed to restart working-level negotiations that had been stalled since an unsuccessful second summit between the two leaders in Vietnam in February. Since the DMZ meeting, however, American officials said their attempts to resume talks had gone unanswered. North Korea has also conducted at least eight test launches since then, usually with multiple missiles each time. �All of these acts by North Korea that escalate tensions do not help efforts to ease tension on the Korean peninsula, and we reiterate our calls for an immediate halt,� South Korea�s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. The U.S. special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, spoke by telephone with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Do-hoon, on Tuesday morning, South Korea�s foreign ministry said in a statement. Biegun has led working-level talks with North Korea. He discussed with Lee how to make substantive progress on denuclearisation and peace, according to the ministry, which did not mention Choe�s comments or the latest launches. While analysts said North Korea conducts missile tests for a range of purposes, including technical development and reassurance for the defence establishment, Tuesday�s launches appeared to have been timed to send a message to Washington. The launches were probably the latest case of Kim turning to missile tests as diplomatic signalling, said Daniel DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington-based think-tank.  �Far be it from me to get inside Kim�s head, but the simplest answer may be the most accurate: North Korea is demonstrating what will happen if the U.S. doesn�t come to the table with realistic proposals,� he said. Trump has played down previous tests this year, saying he did not believe short-range missiles violated any agreements. Other officials, including Trump�s national security adviser John Bolton, have said even short-range launches by North Korea are banned under U.N. resolutions.  North Korea declared last year a self-imposed moratorium on tests of nuclear weapons as well as launches of its long-range intermediate and intercontinental ballistic missiles. �Going by what they�ve said so far, they�re not too concerned about effects on talks with the U.S.,� said Joshua Pollack, a North Korea expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.  �Trump has given them a pass on short-range missiles,� he said. �Instead, they have indicated their displeasure with Seoul.� North Korea has said its development of new weapons aims to counter military threats and offensive pressures against its security, including joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea and the arrival of new stealth fighter aircraft in the South. While the missiles unveiled this year have been short-range, analysts warn they have shown significant technological advances and could be used to evade missile defences.

""What is ISRO going to gain by this move is not known.

Maharashtra has become pregnant for the 20th time, doctors
said on Monday.The 38-year-old woman from Beed district, who has had
16 successful deliveries and three abortions so far, is now
seven months' pregnant, doctors said.Each time, she delivered a single child and five of
them died within a few hours or days of delivery, while 11
have survived, doctors said.All the three abortions were when she was around three
month pregnant, they said.Hailing from the nomadic Gopal community, Lankabai
Kharat was spotted by local health officials who were stunned
to learn about her being pregnant for the 20th time.""At present, she has 11 children and at the age of 38,
is pregnant for the 20th time,"" Beed district civil surgeon
Dr Ashok Thorat told PTI.When we learned about her pregnancy, she was taken to
the civil hospital and all required tests were conducted. So
far the baby and mother are safe. She has been given a
medication course and instructed on hygiene and other
practices to avoid an infection,"" another doctor said.Thorat said, ""This would be her first delivery at a
hospital. All the earlier deliveries were performed at home.To avoid any health risk, we have advised her to get admitted
at the local government hospital for the delivery, scheduled
in two months.""
Kharat hails from Kesapuri area in Majalgaon tehsil of
Beed district. ""She belongs to the Gopal community, which
generally begs or engages in some daily wage or small-time
jobs. They keep shifting from one location to another,"" an
official from the Beed district collectorate said.A woman's uterus, the organ within which the fetus
develops, is a muscle, and each successive pregnancy stretches
that muscle, the doctor said.As a result, after a woman has had many pregnancies,
the muscle has a hard time contracting after the placenta
the organ that connects the fetus to the mother's blood supplyseparates, he added.This creates a risk of massive bleeding and because
the uterus has been weakened by successive pregnancies, drugs
to cause this contraction are typically less successful, he
said.Scar tissue from past pregnancies within the uterus
can cause problems with the placenta and this can create
additional risks, including premature birth, he said.",http://www.ptinews.com/news/10838820_Maharashtra-woman-pregnant-for-20th-time.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Gill said the stake sale was initially likely to be less than 10% initially but could rise, describing the buyer as one of the world�s top three technology companies that had not previously invested in a bank. He did not name the investor. Yes Bank later said in a stock exchange notice on Tuesday that news about stake sales was �speculative�, adding that the it looks to raise funds as a normal part of its business.  �The bank in the usual and ordinary course of its business continues to explore various means of raising capital/funds through issuance of securities to diverse set of investors, in order to meet its business/ regulatory requirements, subject to compliance with prescribed procedures and receipt of statutory regulatory approvals,� it said.

Under Indian central bank rules, an individual shareholder cannot hold more than 15% in a bank.

In addition to the tech investor, smaller investors could pump in about $200 million to $250 million, Gill said. �There are two very large Indian family offices, there is a European and also an American private equity firm that have expressed interest,� he added. In August, the bank raised nearly $275 million via a qualified institutional placement (QIP), a capital-raising tool commonly used in India, to improve its capital adequacy ratio.

In an internal petition, the employees have pledged to walk out on September 20th at 11:30AM PT.

Most of the employees who've signed the internal pledge are from the Seattle headquarters, and as Wired points out this could be the first time in Amazon history that workers from its Seattle offices have walked off the job. Workers in other offices have supposedly expressed interest in joining the protest, so there's a chance the action may grow over the next two weeks.This isn't the first time employees have asked Amazon to do more. This spring, thousands of employees published an open letter asking Jeff Bezos and other leaders to adopt a shareholder resolution and company-wide climate change plan.

The modified prosthetic helped two patients with above-the-knee amputations walk faster and consume less oxygen. The two patients also saw significant loss in phantom limb pain.,Engadget,"There's been a lot of research into how to give robots and prosthesis wearers a sense of touch, but it has focused largely on the hands. Now, researchers led by ETH Zurich want to restore sensory feedback for leg amputees, too. In a paper published in Nature Medicine today, the team describes how they modified an off-the-shelf prosthetic leg with sensors and electrodes to give wearers a sense of knee movement and feedback from the sole of the foot on the ground. While their initial sample size was small -- just two users -- the results are promising.The researchers worked with two patients with above-the-knee, or transfemoral, amputations. They used an �ssur prosthetic leg, which comes with a microprocessor and an angle sensor in the knee joint, IEEE Spectrum explains. The team then added an insole with seven sensors to the foot. Those sensors transmit signals in real-time, via Bluetooth to a controller strapped to the user's ankle. An algorithm in the controller encodes the feedback into neural signals and delivers that to a small implant in the patient's tibial nerve, at the back of the thigh. The brain can then interpret those signals as feedback from the knee and foot.The modified prosthetic helped the users walk faster, feel more confident and consume less oxygen -- an indication that it was less strenuous than traditional prosthesis. The team also tested activating the tibial nerve implant to relieve phantom limb pain. Both patients saw a significant reduction in pain after a few minutes of electrical stimulation, but they had to be connected to a device in a lab to receive the treatment. With more testing, the researchers hope they might be able to bring these technologies to more amputees and make both available outside of the lab.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/eth-zurich-prosthetic-leg-sense-of-touch/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

If it fails to cross that $3 billion threshold and not have access to that debt, it would be a significant roadblock to The We Company�s global expansion plans.

In Pakistan, many such incidents are regularly reported where Hindu, Sikh and Christian girls are forcibly converted to Islam and married to Muslim men.The recent incident of abduction, forcible marriage and religious conversion of a Sikh girl of Nankana Sahib is a telling example. Jagjit Kaur daughter of the Granthi of Nanakana Sahib Gurdwara, the birthplace of Shri Guru Nanak Dev, in Pakistan, was allegedly abducted and forcibly converted to Islam after her marriage to a Muslim man.The matter had raised a furore in India, with several political leaders across parties asking for action to be taken against the perpetrators.The incidents have come at a time when Pakistan has been ranting up its diabolic rhetoric of the so-called mistreatment of minorities in India, particularly Muslims, ever since the Indian Parliament decided to revoke the especially accorded constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir. However, the fact remains that Pakistan remains a thoroughly unsafe country for its own minorities.Pakistan has repeatedly been asked by the international community to end discrimination against religious minorities on its soil. Last month, the United States, the UK, and Canada raised the issue of suppression of religious freedom Pakistan and slammed the nation for ""persecuting and repressing"" its religious minorities.The incidents are occurring despite the PTI government's promises to keep a check on anti-Hindu sentiments and its failure to cater the minorities with equal rights and justice.The cricketer-turned politician's time and again ranting of diabolic rhetoric against the RSS ideology, especially in the wake of the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir is a burning example.Amid such incidents, the prime minister currently needs to focus on its cash-strapped economy and providing equal rights to his countrymen, instead of calling ""the goons of the RSS"" are lynching people, threatening judges, intellectuals, and deeming anyone who speaks against them as anti-nationals, which is ""exactly what the Nazis did. India is heading towards disaster with extremist ideology"".

The company hopes to eventually bioprint a full-sized functioning human heart.",Engadget,"The Chicago-based biotech company BIOLIFE4D announced today that it has successfully 3D-bioprinted a mini human heart. The tiny heart has the same structure as a full-sized heart, and the company says it's an important milestone in the push to create an artificial heart viable for transplant.The heart was printed with patient-derived cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, and bioink made from extracellular matrix compounds that replicate the properties of the mammalian heart. BIOLIFE4D first bioprinted human cardiac tissue in June 2018. Earlier this year, the company bioprinted individual heart components, including valves, ventricles and blood vessels. Its process involves reprogramming a patient's white blood cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), which can differentiate into different types of cells, including cardiac cells.Eventually, the company hopes to bioprint a full-sized functioning human heart. Theoretically, bioprinted hearts could reduce or eliminate the need for donor organs. Of course, BIOLIFE4D isn't the only company looking to 3D print organs. Researchers at Tel Aviv University 3D printed a heart earlier this year. We've seen functioning 3D-printed silicone hearts, and bioengineers at MIT managed to 3D print complex vascular networks, like those necessary to sustain artificial organs.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/biolife4d-3d-bioprints-mini-human-heart/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Ever since then, most of the international teams have decided not to tour the country citing security reasons. Instead, Pakistan has been playing at a neutral venue in UAE. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been trying hard to bring cricket back to the country of late.Earlier, the Islanders toured Pakistan in 2017 for the shortest format of the game.

2167,Apple modifies App Store search to not always put own apps first,Apple has confirmed that it modified the algorithm related to its App Store searches so that its own apps do not always get displayed first. This comes after Apple faced heavy criticism and potential anti-trust investigations over allegations of unfair favouritism and rankings. Apple had said the App Store algorithm grouped apps by developers and displayed them by their popularity.,Engadget,"Did you notice that Apple's software was suddenly less dominant in the App Store this summer?  There's a good reason for that.  Apple confirmed to the New York Times that it changed App Store search algorithms in July so that its own apps didn't overwhelm the top results.  For more than a year, its own titles would dominate searches for basic terms, even when the apps in question weren't related to a given query -- you sometimes had to scroll through 14 apps before you got to a third-party result for ""podcast,"" for example.  Apple attributed the behavior to a search engine feature that sometimes grouped apps by developer, with popularity also playing a role.If a given search included multiple Apple apps, the algorithm would decide that people were looking for a particular Apple app and pop up more software from that developer.  The problem, as you might guess, is that users would frequently tap on Apple's titles -- sometimes because they were looking for the preinstalled apps on their phones, company engineers said.  When Apple noticed that the algorithm was stuffing the results, it first stopped that behavior for some searches and, in July, disabled the practice for all Apple apps.Apple executives maintained that it wasn't intentionally gaming the system, but also that the algorithm was working properly.  ""This wasn't a mistake,"" senior VP Phil Schiller said.  Instead, they characterized the change as a boost for third-party developers.Others don't see it that way, though.  Some third-party app makers noted that they've been buried in App Store search results -- Stitcher said it didn't even see the ""podcast"" search term as a significant download source.   And when Spotify was down to 23rd in searches for ""music"" at one point, it's hard to ignore the service's allegations against Apple for allegedly privileging Apple Music over competing services.  The US Supreme Court also allowed a lawsuit accusing Apple of price fixing and abusing a monopoly over iOS app distribution.  Apple has maintained that the App Store isn't a monopoly.Apple isn't the only tech giant facing scrutiny over claimed favoritism.  Google has faced regulatory action for allegedly preferring its own products in search results.  The company is clearly facing more pressure to address prioritization than it has in the past, though -- this might address some gripes that would otherwise reach the courts.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/apple-app-store-search-rank-changes/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

I was the last one to board the flight. This is not the first time this has happened to me. It is unfair.Due to shortage of time, I wasn�t able to complain to the airport authorities at that very moment.

CWI president Ricky Skerritt made the announcement in a press conference in Trinidad on Monday. Pollard, who last played an ODI for the Windies against Pakistan back in October 2016, replaces Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite as the new ODI and T20I skipper respectively.",CricTracker,"Over the last few months, West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has struggled to pick the right person as the captain of the side. In limited-overs cricket, there has been a lot of shuffling around. Jason Holder, who is also the Test captain of the team, was named the captain of the ODI side for the World Cup 2019. However, the all-rounder hasn�t tasted a great deal of success as the skipper. Thus, a change seemed inevitable and there were quite a few names up for consideration. But, quite surprisingly, the WICB decided to go ahead with Kieron Pollard.The 32-year-old, who has been actively playing in various T20 leagues all over the world, isn�t a regular part of the West Indies set-up. Pollard has represented the team in the T20I format on and off in the last few years. Hence, this decision from the West Indies Cricket Board was quite shocking and surprising. Even though he was a part of the T20I series against India recently, Kieron Pollard didn�t feature in the ODI team for a while now.AdvertisementKieron Pollard last played an ODI game against Pakistan at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in 2016. Ever since then, he was constantly overlooked by the selectors even though he performed well at times. Furthermore, he was ignored for the World Cup 2019 as well and was no way in contention to make it into the ODI team any time soon. However, the WICB decided to name his the skipper for this format as well as for the T20I format. This means that he will be replacing Carlos Brathwaite as the leader of the team in the shortest format of the game.Thus far in his career, Kieron Pollard has featured in a total of 101 ODI matches. He scored 2289 runs at an average of about 26. The veteran cricketer has got 3 centuries and 9 half-centuries to his name. Moreover, he also played 62 T20Is where he scored 903 runs.

2180,45 Google employees faced retaliation for complaints to HR: Report,"As many as 45 Google employees reportedly faced retaliation after they complained to Human Resources on issues like workplace harassment and unethical work culture. They alleged retaliation in forms of demotion, being pushed out and negative reviews, Recode reported. In 2018, 20,000 employees held a walkout protest against Google's handling of sexual harassment accusations against top executives.",Engadget,"It's been nearly a year since 20,000 Google employees held a walkout to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment and misconduct. While Google promised to make changes, employees have since charged the company with having a ""retaliation culture."" Today, Recode reports that a dozen current and former Google employees are still afraid to report workplace issues.In an internal document obtained by Recode, 45 employees say they were demoted, pushed out or placed on less desirable projects after they filed complaints with human resources. Employees told Recode that Google continues to conceal, rather than address, issues ranging from sexual harassment to security.In a statement provided to Engadget, Google's VP of People Operations Eileen Naughton said:""Reporting misconduct takes courage and we want to provide care and support to people who raise concerns. All instances of inappropriate conduct reported to us are investigated rigorously, and over the past year we have simplified how employees can raise concerns and provided more transparency into the investigations process at Google. We work to be extremely transparent about how we handle complaints and the action we take.""After the walkout last fall, Google did update its policies for handling sexual misconduct. The company ended forced arbitration and outlined how investigations would be handled. Employees said that was a good start but not enough. Months later, one walkout leader left the company over alleged retaliation. Shortly after, another followed. By April, employees organized a town hall to share their experiences of workplace retaliation.Recode's findings are consistent with the reports that have come out over the last year. But a document with dozens of employees claiming they've faced retaliation makes the handful of high-profile situations from last year appear to be part of a much bigger issue.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/google-employees-fear-retaliation-culture/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2182,Children in Hong Kong form chains in support of protests,"Hundreds of uniformed school students, many wearing masks, formed human chains in districts across Hong Kong on Monday in support of anti-government protesters and chanted, ""Hong Kong people, add oil"". ""The school-based human chain is the strongest showcase of how this protest is deep-rooted in society,"" said Alan Leong, an alumnus of Wah Yan College in the citys Kowloon district.",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of uniformed school students, many wearing masks, formed human chains in districts across Hong Kong on Monday in support of anti-government protesters after another weekend of clashes in the Chinese-ruled city. Metro stations reopened after some were closed on Sunday amid sometimes violent confrontations, although the mood in the Asian financial hub remained tense.  Early on Monday, before school started, rows of students and alumni joined hands chanting �Hong Kong people, add oil�, a phrase that has become a rallying cry for the protest movement.      �The school-based human chain is the strongest showcase of how this protest is deep rooted in society, so deep rooted that it enters through the school students,� said Alan Leong, an alumnus of Wah Yan College in the city�s Kowloon district. Three months of protests over a now withdrawn extradition bill have evolved into a broader backlash against the government and greater calls for democracy. Police said they had arrested 157 people over the previous three days, including 125 males and 32 females aged 14 to 63, bringing the total number of arrests to more than 1,300.  The former British colony is facing its first recession in a decade as the protests scare off tourists and bite into retail sales in one of the world�s most popular shopping destinations. Tourist arrivals plunged 40% in August year on year, said Paul Chan, the city�s finance secretary, with sustained clashes blocking roads and paralyzing parts of the city. Disruptions at the city�s international had also hit the tourism industry. �The most worrying thing is that the road ahead is not easily going to turn any better,� Chan said in his blog on Sunday, noting that some hotels had seen room rates plunge up to 70%.   Activists started fires in the street and vandalized a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station in the main business district of Central on Sunday after thousands rallied peacefully at the U.S. consulate, calling for help in bringing democracy to the special administrative region. The students, brandishing posters with the protesters� five demands for the government, called on authorities to respond to the promises of freedom, human rights and rule of law, promised when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997.One of the five demands - to formally withdraw the extradition bill - was announced last week by embattled leader Carrie Lam, but protesters are angry about her failure to call an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality against demonstrators. U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet urged people to protest peacefully and called on authorities to respond to any acts of violence with restraint. The protesters� other demands include the retraction of the word �riot� to describe demonstrations, the release of all those arrested and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders. A journalist wearing a hard hat and protective goggles at a police briefing condemned the use by police of pepper spray against media over the weekend. In a rare public appearance, Lam walked around the central business district with the city�s Transport and Housing Secretary Frank Chan and MTR officials to inspect the damaged station, where she chatted with staff and commuters.  Dressed in a black suit, she examined electronic ticketing machines and boarded up windows smashed the previous day, according to footage by public broadcaster RTHK. Following the demonstration at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, Hong Kong�s government warned foreign lawmakers not to interfere in the city�s internal affairs after thousands of protesters called on U.S. President Donald Trump to �liberate� the city. Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a �one country, two systems� formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy. China denies the accusation of meddling in the city and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy. Chinese state media on Monday said Hong Kong was an inseparable part of China and any form of secessionism �will be crushed�.  The China Daily newspaper said Sunday�s rally was proof foreign forces were behind the protests and warned demonstrators should �stop trying the patience of the central government�.   Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was released from police custody after breaching bail conditions following his arrest in August when he was charged along with a number of other prominent activists for inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly.  A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was monitoring events. �The freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong, and those freedoms must be vigorously protected. As the president has said, �They�re looking for democracy and I think most people want democracy�,� the official said.

2196,MJ Akbar case came at great personal cost to me: Priya Ramani,"Journalist Priya Ramani, against whom former Union Minister MJ Akbar filed a defamation case for alleging sexual harassment, told a Delhi court that the case came at a great personal cost. ""I've nothing to gain...I'm a well-known journalist and live a quiet life with my family in Bengaluru. It's not easy for any woman to make such disclosures,"" she said.",The Quint,"In her cross-examination in defamation case filed by former Union Minister MJ Akbar, journalist Priya Ramani on Monday, 9 September, said it was necessary to say what she did and has spoken the truth at a �great personal cost�.Ramani said, �I spoke the truth in my Vogue article and in my tweet. It is important for women to speak up about sexual harassment at workplace. Many of us are brought up to believe that silence is a virtue.�She concluded her statement as a defence witness on Monday � with the end of this �examination-chief�, her cross-examination by MJ Akbar�s lawyers began. The cross-examination was not concluded on Monday, and will resume when the matter is taken up next on 24 and 25 October.Senior advocate Geeta Luthra, who is representing MJ Akbar, began her cross-examination on Monday by asking Ramani several personal questions about her ambitions of becoming a journalist, and her tenures at various media organisations.First she asked her which journalists she had looked up to when growing up and as a student. Ramani answered by naming a few journalists including Harinder Baweja � who was present in court to support her � but Luthra insisted on her naming others as well. After that, Luthra asked her which newspapers she�d read while growing up, and again pressed her after she�d named a few.Luthra wanted to know which articles Ramani had written during her stint with the Asian from January to October 1994.�In the first 10 days, when I worked in Delhi, I worked on dry run articles about political press conferences that I attended,� Ramani said. She then added �When I moved to Bombay, I was a business journalist. I had a report every day on the Bombay Stock Exchange.� On being asked, she said that she wrote around one article a day, as she was the only business correspondent at the Bombay office of the Asian Age.Luthra wanted to know what the headlines of the articles were and kept pressing for these details, but Ramani said she could not remember these.Luthra then asked Ramani about her time at Reuters, which she joined after the Asian Age. She wanted to know when she joined, and for details of the articles she wrote. Ramani answered that she used to write the daily stock reports at Reuters, but couldn�t remember her exact joining dates.The same questions were then repeated for Ramani�s stint at Elle magazine, which she joined after working at Reuters. She interjected several times when Ramani tried to respond, explaining she didn�t write that many articles as she had different responsibilities as a deputy editor there.Despite Ramani clarifying that she did not remember the dates she joined any organisation, Luthra then proceeded to ask her the exact date of joining Cosmopolitan magazine and, again, the specific names of articles that she wrote.When Ramani replied she used to write the �Edit Note� in each issue of Cosmopolitan, and could provide copies of these to the court at the next hearing, Luthra objected again, saying these were columns, not articles.She maintained that the Asian Age was a good opportunity to realise the dream, but denied Luthra�s suggestion that she would have given up on being a journalist if she hadn�t got that job with the Asian Age.On Saturday, Ramani had narrated what had happened during her interview with Akbar, but Luthra suggested on Monday no interview took place in the way she described it, and that she �maliciously and intentionally concocted this story to damage Mr Akbar's reputation,� adding that her 2018 tweet about her article amounted to �false news�.Also Read : Hope I�ve Become A Better Person: Aziz Ansari on #MeToo AllegationThe most effective moment for MJ Akbar came when Luthra alleged that Ramani had �multiple opportunities to call out Akbra�s sexual harassment earlier, but only brought them out later with the intent to harm him.�She posited that articles had been written about sexual harassment at the workplace for many years before the MeToo movement broke, including in 2013 when Tarun Tejpal was accused of sexual harassment. Luthra then pulled out something Ramani did not seem to be expecting, an article on sexual harassment at the workplace by Ramani in November 2013 in Mint titled �Sorry boss, we found our voices�.The other key line of questioning by Luthra seeks to demonstrate that the entirety of Ramani�s article in Vogue in 2017 was about MJ Akbar. This is because the article talks of more than just the alleged inappropriate behaviour by Akbar during his interview with Ramani, but also talks of other examples of sexual harassment and even assault.Ramani has argued that the article, which does not refer to anyone by name, is not all about Akbar. She reiterated several times during the cross-examination as well that she clearly said in her 2018 tweet that her Vogue article �began� with her MJ Akbar story, and that after the first four paragraphs, it deals with generic examples of sexual harassment by male editors.To prove her point, Luthra tried to use replies to Ramani�s tweets by random members of the public, and also tried to ask her questions about what the �common man� would think when viewing the tweet and article together. However, the judge accepted the objections raised by Rebecca John to these questions, noting that Ramani was not there to testify on behalf of the common man.In conclusion, Ramani termed Luthra�s suggestions that her tweets affected Akbar�s image and the article lowered his reputation in the eyes of the �general public and right-thinking members of society� as �incorrect�.Akbar filed a criminal defamation complaint against Ramani after she accused him of sexual harassment as the #MeToo campaign raged on in India last year.Ramani, on Saturday, testified as the first defence witness in the case wherein she recalled the entire timeline of events since 1993 � right from her ""uncomfortable"" interview with Akbar to leaving his office and never working with him again.She added, �I never met Mr Akbar alone in the Delhi office or the Bombay office alone. We always interacted in the edit meetings or with the whole office.�She talked about getting the opportunity of writing an article in Vogue magazine on male bosses in the backdrop of #MeToo movement.Barkha Dutt, Tavleen Singh, Namita Bhandare and Suhasini Haider were also present in the court in a show of support for Ramani on Saturday. Rajdeep Sardesai, Siddarth Varadarajan, Harinder Baweja were present in the court on Monday.On 23 August, she had begun her statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the court and said, �I defend the truth spoken in public interest and for the public good. It is only now that sexual harassment at workplace is regarded as a serious offence.�Akbar resigned as minister on 17 October 2018.Also Read : Akbar Defamation Suit: �Spoke Truth for Public Good,� Says Ramani(Hi there!

2201,Wunderlist Founder offers to buy app back from Microsoft,"Christian Reber, the Founder of to-do lists app Wunderlist, has offered to buy the app back from Microsoft which acquired it in 2015. Adding a list of improvements he would make to Wunderlist, Reber further offered that Microsoft could keep the team and focus on its own task-management app 'To-Do'. Stopping app updates, Microsoft had announced it will retire Wunderlist.",Engadget,"Microsoft's acquisition of the Wunderlist team is creating friction years after the fact. The founder of 6 Wunderkinder, Christian Reber, has offered to buy back the task app to prevent Microsoft from shutting it down. There are people who ""still love and use it,"" Reber explained, and this would avoid their wrath while Microsoft shifts its focus to its To-Do app. Microsoft could keep the team and its priorities -- the developer just wants his pride and joy to remain intact.Reber added that he had ""nothing but gratitude"" for Microsoft, and that he was simply sad Wunderlist didn't go as planned.It's a thorny situation for Microsoft. Wunderlist's cloud features still run on Amazon Web Services instead of Azure, The Verge noted, but Microsoft can't easily pull the plug after saying it would only shut down Wunderlist once To-Do had feature parity. At the same time, selling Wunderlist to Reber would create its own complications -- To-Do would have a direct competitor using rival services. The founder planned to improve it if he did get control, including improved performance, new features and open source code.While there aren't any indications Microsoft is about to take up Reber's request, this does illustrate the mixed results of the company's app acquisition spree. Microsoft fared well when it snapped up Acompli to bolster Outlook on mobile. The buyout of Sunrise, however, was less well received -- people lamented the loss of Sunrise Calendar even as its features found their way into Outlook. The Wunderlist purchase is somewhere in between. Microsoft may have gone out of its way to keep Wunderlist alive, but its threat of pulling the app has made some people nervous.Still sad @Microsoft wants to shut down @Wunderlist, even though people still love and use it. I'm serious @satyanadella @marcusash, please let me buy it back. Keep the team and focus on @MicrosoftToDo, and no one will be angry for not shutting down @Wunderlist. pic.twitter.com/27mIABncLF",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/08/wunderlist-creator-wants-to-buy-app-from-microsoft/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""I think anyone that tries to exploit kids without permission for their own gain might need to take a hard look in the mirror and ask themselves �would they want anyone to do this to their own children�? As for those that troll toddlers and teens, I have no words for that kind of behavior. Trash talking anyone under 21 publicly should be illegal. It�s sad that such a great and powerful technology such as social media, is tainted by people wanting to hurt, mock, humiliate or just insist on throwing opinions with no fear of the damage such hate can cause the youth.
