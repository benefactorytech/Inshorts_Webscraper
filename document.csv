The 33-year-old actress' latest screen outing was Padmaavat, which had hit theatres early last year. It's been more than one-and-a-half-year since she graced the silver screen and her fans have been getting antsy. Even her next box-office release, Chhapaak, is months away. Directed by Meghna Gulzar of Raazi and Talwar fame, Chhapaak would see Deepika essaying the role of an acid attack survivor named Malti and the movie is based on the life of Laxmi Agarwal. She was only recently announced to be a part of the huge cast of Kabir Khan's sports drama '83. For the movie, Deepika would be reuniting with her husband and multiple-time co-star Ranveer Singh. Deepika would be playing Romi Bhatia, the on-screen wife of Ranveer Singh, who would be essaying the role of former Indian cricket team skipper Kapil Dev in the movie. The duo has previously acted together in Goliyon Ki Raasleela: Ram-leela, Bajirao Mastani and Padmaavat. 

She revealed in an official statement that she has been craving to do a lighter role after back-to-back intense roles. She said, “Honestly speaking, I’ve always enjoyed playing characters that take a lot out of me, emotionally. Even in ’83, there are extreme highs and lows that Romi also goes through in the journey towards Indian cricket team creating history by winning the world cup. But the film also explores lighter moments between Romi and Kapil Dev. So, in that sense, you can say that it has been a lighter part emotionally.”While Chhapaak is slated for a January 10 release next year, '83 will arrive in cinemas exactly four months later on April 10, 2020. For Chhapaak, Vikrant Massey has been roped in to play the male lead and Deepika has also donned the producer's hat for the movie for the first time.

The 26-year-old joint vice-captain -- who took himself off to France for a break following the World Cup semi-final loss to eventual champions England this month -- told The Guardian Paine's arrival in the wake of the scandal had forced a rethink about their approach to the game.Former captain Steve Smith and his then deputy David Warner were both given 12-month suspensions by Cricket Australia, with opening batsman Cameron Bancroft -- who applied sandpaper to the ball while in the field during a Test with South Africa in Cape Town -- banned for nine months.They are all back in the squad for the five-Test Ashes series which gets underway at Edgbaston on Thursday with the tourists bidding to not only retain the Ashes but also win their first series in England for 18 years. ""It's probably the first time where we've really had to sit back and think about how we wanted to play,"" said Cummins about when Paine took over.""For me personally, going to university (he has a Business degree) or having a few pre-seasons trying to recover from injury, it's just knowing that you can't judge yourself on purely cricket, because if you do then you're forever riding this rollercoaster. ""Definitely taking a step back gives you time to actually think."" 'Sense a wicket coming' Cummins, who has rebounded from several years of persistent injuries to be key to the Australian attack, said people who mistook that for the team going soft would be lulling themselves into a false sense of security.""The way I've always played is to get into the fight,"" he said. ""This is a side that's really hungry, many of them in their first Ashes, their first away Test.

So make the most of it.""Cummins, who lost the top of a middle finger aged three when one of his sisters slammed a door on it by mistake, says he believes he can flourish in the English pitches. ""There always seems to be sideways movement and the Dukes ball, even if it goes soft, still has a bit of swing,"" he said.""It's not 40 degrees so you can run in all day. ""It feels like if you put into the wicket you're going to get something out of it. ""It levels the contest sometimes as opposed to a flat day-three or day-four wicket in Australia or a flat ODI wicket, sometimes you go into defence mode. ""Over here you can always sense a wicket coming.""Cummins had been a rare bird within the Australia camp to speak out about sledging last year but he says one cannot avoid displaying one's emotions.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the Boko Haram group and rival Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA)  splinter group have often carried out attacks in the area.

Others were injured, he said, meaning the death toll may rise. President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday condemned the attack and directed the military to hunt down the perpetrators, a statement from the presidential office said. Borno state is the epicenter of the Boko Haram and ISWA insurgency. The conflict has lasted a decade, during which time the militants have killed thousands and millions have fled from their homes in the region.

Nigeria’s military declined to comment.  Buhari won a second term in February promising to improve security in Nigeria.

It competes with other games like Electronic Arts Inc’s Apex Legends and Tencent Holdings Ltd’s PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. Tencent also owns a 40% stake in Epic Games. Global revenues from esports, or professional video game competitions, will hit $1.1 billion in 2019, up 27 percent since last year, thanks to ballooning revenues from advertising, sponsorship and media rights, according to a report released earlier this year. Overall, the global video and electronic games market, excluding revenues from esports, will generate $152.1 billion in 2019, up 9.6% over last year, according to a report by gaming analytics firm Newzoo.

34,Byju's Founder Byju Raveendran India's newest billionaire: Bloomberg,"Bengaluru-based edtech startup Byju's Founder and CEO Byju Raveendran, a 37-year-old former teacher, is India's newest billionaire, Bloomberg said on Monday. This comes after Byju's valuation hit $5.7 billion after raising $150 million in funding led by Qatar Investment Authority earlier this month, Bloomberg added. Byju Raveendran owns more than 21% of the startup, Bloomberg said quoting sources.",The Financial Express,"India’s newest billionaire is a former classroom teacher who developed an education app that’s grown to a valuation of almost $6 billion in about seven years. Byju Raveendran joined the rarefied club after his Think & Learn Pvt scored $150 million in funding earlier this month. That deal conferred a value of $5.7 billion on the company in which the founder owns more than 21%, people familiar with the matter said. Its closing coincided with the announcement that the company’s Byju’s app — named after the founder — will team up with Walt Disney Co. and taking its service to American shores by early 2020.The 37-year-old entrepreneur — who has said he wants to do for Indian education what the Mouse House did for entertainment — is taking his biggest step yet geographically and creatively. In his new app, Disney staples from The Lion King’s Simba to Frozen’s Anna teach math and English to students from grades one through three. The same characters star in animated videos, games, stories and interactive quizzes.“Kids everywhere relate to Disney’s Simba or Moana, who grip kids’ attention before we take them through the loop of learning,” said Raveendran, also chief executive officer.India is going through a dramatic period of wealth creation — and destruction. A new breed of self-made entrepreneurs is joining the ranks of the well-heeled, helping the country’s ultra-rich population grow at the world’s fastest pace. Raveendran, at least on paper, assumes his place among those parvenus thanks to his effort in internet education.Online learning is booming, perhaps nowhere more so than on Byju’s home turf, where internet usage is exploding because of the ubiquity of cheap smartphones and cut-price wireless plans. India’s online learning market is expected to more than double to $5.7 billion by 2020, according to the government-backed India Brand Equity Foundation.Education technology for kindergarten through 12th grade is one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s internet market, said Anil Kumar, chief executive officer of Redseer Management Consulting Pvt. “Indian education startups are well set to seize the global opportunity given that they already cater to a large English-speaking base and have created unique education content,” he said.Byju’s own fortunes have climbed alongside the market. Its revenues are expected to more than double to 30 billion rupees ($435 million) in the year ending March 2020, Raveendran said. That pace of growth has already caught the eye of some of the industry’s biggest investors from Naspers Ventures and Tencent Holdings Ltd. to Sequoia Capital and Facebook-founder Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan.Those big-name backers buy Raveendran’s vision. The Byju’s founder grew up in a village on India’s southern coast where his parents were school-teachers. He was a reluctant pupil, playing hooky to frequent the football field, then learning on his own at home. He became an engineer and then began helping friends crack entry exams to top Indian engineering and management schools. The classes swelled till he finally began teaching thousands in sports stadiums, becoming a celebrity tutor who commuted between multiple cities during weekends.He set up Think & Learn in 2011, offering online lessons before launching his main app in 2015. The business has signed up more than 35 million of whom about 2.4 million pay an annual fee of 10,000 to 12,000 rupees, helping it became profitable in the year ending March 2019. That’s when Raveendran began courting long-term investors such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds — his latest backer is the Qatar Investment Authority. In Byju’s latest funding round, the entrepreneur bought shares to maintain his equity level. Along with his wife and brother, the Raveendran clan now holds a total stake of about 35%, said the people familiar, asking not to be quoted as the matter is private.Byju’s approach is simple — captivate kids by transforming the content to fit short attention spans. Raveendran has always harbored ambitions to crack English-speaking countries, and has flown in YouTube stars to feature in his videos.In Disney, he may have found a ready-made audience. All the lessons on the new service with Disney are set in the context of the entertainment giant’s classics and stay true to the narrative. To explain temperature, the app sets up a scene where Frozen’s Elsa falls ill because she constantly plays with snow. Anna gets out the thermometer to gauge her fever and a little story is then built around heat and cold. Or, to learn shapes, young learners dive into the story of Cars where they have to sort items like tires, traffic cones and billboards into buckets to learn about round, triangular and rectangular shapes.“We are customizing Disney Byju’s to the American and British school curriculum,” Raveendran said. “The characters have universal appeal.”Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

43,20 killed in attack on Afghan vice presidential candidate's office,"At least 20 people were killed and 50 injured in Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Sunday in a suicide bombing and gun battle at vice presidential candidate Amrullah Saleh's office. Saleh, a running mate of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, was slightly injured in the attack. Afghan forces killed three militants who entered Saleh's office after a suicide bomber blew himself up.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - The death toll from a suicide attack on the Kabul office of Amrullah Saleh, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s running mate in September elections, reached 20 with at least 50 wounded, officials said on Monday as cleanup operations began. Saleh, a former intelligence chief and security adviser who is running for vice president with Ghani, was slightly wounded in Sunday’s attack on the office of his Green Trends party in central Kabul. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack, which came at the start of official campaigning for presidential elections scheduled for Sept. 28. Zalmay Khalilzad, the veteran Afghan-American diplomat who is leading the U.S. side in peace negotiations with the Taliban, condemned Sunday’s attack and said the perpetrators must be brought to justice. “The attack on Amrullah Saleh’s political party offices was grotesque and a clear act of terrorism,” he said on Twitter. Already delayed twice this year, the elections are likely to prove a severe organisational and security test for Ghani’s government, which came to power in 2014 following a bitterly fought campaign and a poll marred by accusations of widespread fraud. Sunday’s attack added to an anxious mood in Kabul, where there is concern over chaotic election preparations and uncertainty about the future of U.S. military support for the Afghan government. U.S. diplomats have been talking with the Taliban for months to agree a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees. The talks are expected to resume early next month amid increasing expectations that the two sides are close to an agreement. Ghani declared on Sunday that peace was coming but he has so far been excluded from the talks because of the Taliban’s refusal to negotiate with a government it considers a foreign-appointed “puppet” regime. The attack in central Kabul - a virtual fortress of concrete blast walls, razor wire and police checkpoints - underlined how difficult it will be to maintain security during the election campaign, with government control slipping across the country.  A suicide bomber in a car packed with explosives blew himself up at a security checkpoint near Saleh’s headquarters late on Sunday, opening the way for three gunmen to force their way into a four-storey office building. More than 150 civilians were rescued during a six-hour operation, Interior Ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.  The casualties included four members of the security forces and 16 civilians who were killed and 43 civilians and seven security personnel who were wounded. Security has been deteriorating across Afghanistan, with the Taliban and Islamic State fighters mounting near-daily attacks on Afghan forces, government employees and civilians.

52,Jayawardene-Sangakkara's record 624-run stand lasted 10 hours,"Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara broke the record for the highest-ever partnership in Test history with their 624-run stand against South Africa on July 29, 2006. The partnership started when SL were 14/2 and saw Sangakkara scoring 287(457) and Jayawardene hitting a career-best 374(572). The duo batted for 10-plus hours through 157 overs across three days.",Cricket Country,"Kumar Sangakkara (left) and Mahela Jayawardene were involved in a world record 624-run stand for Sri Lanka against South Africa in 2006 © AFPOn July 29, 2006, the prolific Sri Lankan captain and vice-captain pair of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara pummeled their way to a record-breaking stand against South Africa at Colombo. Jaideep Vaidya goes through the elegant carnage.
Sangakkara and Jayawardene. Not the easiest of words to pronounce, more so when spoken together. However, for enthusiasts of cricket, the two words sound and resonate to a rhythm that seems to come right out of a Robert Frost piece. Sangakkara and Jayawardene may not be as prolific and popular as Greenidge and Haynes, or Tendulkar and Dravid, or Hayden and Langer, but when the two Sri Lankans bat together, they appear to be made for each other — in every sense.The success story Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene — or ‘Sangawardene’ if you may — isn’t any ordinary one. The left-right combination thoroughly enjoy each other’s company on the field and are best of pals even off it. They are co-owners of a popular sea-food joint on the Emerald Isle and the owners of Sri Lanka’s most successful batting pairing on the cricket field ever. In 107 Test innings together, the duo have piled 5,713 runs — the fourth-highest tally ever recorded by a partnership in Tests — at 55.46. The way they are going, even in the last mile of their careers, it won’t be surprising if they go on to beat Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid’s record of 6,920 runs.Watching ‘Sangawardene’ bat is like watching a well-oiled machine, functioning like clockwork. Their instincts and ability to read each other’s minds and concerns seem innate. If one is struggling, the other takes up the majority of the scoring responsibility and allows the other to settle down. If the situation calls for a brisk 100-run partnership, they will step on it and surge ahead; and if it calls for a grinding, patient and persevering mammoth stand, Sangakkara and Jayawardene will do it blindfolded, like they did at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) ground, Colombo, in 2006 against a hapless South African attack.It wasn’t the liveliest and challenging of pitches in hot and humid late July. On the first couple of days, it promised to be a perfect batting track and the South Africans got their noses ahead by winning the toss and opting to bat first. However, the Proteas’ advantage was negated by Dilhara Fernando and Muttiah Muralitharan, who bagged four victims each, and helped Sri Lanka bowl their guests out by tea on the first day itself, for a none-too-impressive 169.In response, a charged-up Dale Steyn scalped the two Lankan openers, Upul Tharanga and Sanath Jayasuriya, within the first four overs. This was when Sangakkara and Jayawardene came together. The awesome twosome took the attack to the Proteas and scored at a rate just under five to end the day on 128 for two, just 41 runs behind, with both scoring unbeaten half-centuries.Mahela Jayawardene (left) went onto score 374, while Kumar Sangakkara was dismissed for 287 © AFPDay Two saw more pain and toil for the South Africans as ‘Sangawardene’ settled in and dug into their opposition. The shots were crisp and rarely missing the sweet spot of the bats. There was barely any aggression, but elegance aplenty as they sprayed boundaries all over the park. It was almost as if they waltzed along carefree, with no apprehension or obstacle to mind of, reducing the South African bowlers to mere puppets made to deliver the red cherries to whack. They played throughout the day, scoring 357 runs and not giving the now homesick tourists the pleasure of even a single wicket — a record tally. At stumps, Sri Lanka were on an imposing 485 for two, with both Sangakkara and Jayawardene recording double centuries.After a nice ice bath, physio and masseur session, and a good night’s rest, the duo carried on the following day. By lunch on Day Three, their partnership stood at 570 — just seven runs behind the world record 576-run stand between Jayasuriya (340) and Roshan Mahanama (225) against India. Post the interval, Sangakkara and Jayawardene held the new world record in both Test and First-Class cricket, which was celebrated by the ground authorities with loud fireworks. Unlike the Khettarama Test eight years ago, this one didn’t seem to be heading towards a meaningless draw, with the Lankans having more than two days to bowl South Africa out again.“We knew it was the record — both the Test and First-Class record — it’s a great feeling, to do something that nobody else has done before,” Sangakkara was quoted as saying by the Guardian after the innings ended. “That’s what records are there for, to inspire you to try to break them. Hopefully one day someone else will break this one — that’s the way cricket should go.”Finally, after 157 overs and over 10 hours of tireless defiance, Sangakkara chased after a wide delivery from Andrew Hall and ended up nicking it to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. Sangakkara’s archetypal classy innings had ended on 287, just 13 short of what would have been a second triple century in the same innings, after Jayawardene had earlier notched his. However, Sangakkara’s knock was good enough to go down the record books as the highest ever Test score by a wicketkeeper, beating his own record of 270. Sangakkara and Jayawardene also became only the second pair in Test history to score 250s in the same innings, after Garry Sobers and Conrad Hunte achieved it for West Indies against Pakistan in 1957-58. Their third-wicket epic had ended on 624 runs — a record that will take something to emulate.“I cannot in anyway be disappointed,” Sangakkara said later. “How can you be after you have scored 287? But having said that, I must admit I was looking to get to 300. As for the [earlier world] record [partnership], I can recall following it as a schoolboy when the two greats of that time Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama established it. It is a good feeling to be able to pass that record.”Meanwhile, Jayawardene wasn’t done for the day and soldiered on. As he got past his triple hundred, becoming only the second Sri Lankan after Jayasuriya to do so, and looked unflappable in the middle, the SSC crowd began to dream of the ultimate. Brian Lara’s world record of 400 runs in an innings was not so far away now, and with enough time left in the match to win it, Jayawardene had the blessings of his teammates and coach Tom Moody to carry on. The South Africans looked down and out, all but ready to collapse. It was almost inevitable.However, the perennially sprightly Andre Nel, who had been bludgeoned all over the SSC for more than six sessions, delivered a ball that kept low and snuck under the bat to dislodge the Jayawardene’s woodwork. Almost cruelly, he was gone for 374, achieved from facing 572 balls at the crease and hitting 44 fours and a six. He had fallen just one run short of Lara’s 1994 figure of 375 and six behind Matthew Hayden’s 380. However, what made his innings stand out was the fact that he had not offered his opposition a single chance before the delivery that dismissed him, unlike Sangakkara who had been bowled off a no-ball and dropped at gully.Jayawardene declared his team’s innings immediately after his dismissal, on 756 for five — the fourth highest score in Test history. A 587-run lead was surplus for his bowlers to bowl South Africa out on the final day for 434, handing them a handsome innings and 153-run win. To further rub salt in their opponents’ wounds, Sri Lanka’s lead of 587 was the highest achieved by a side batting second, beating South Africa’s own 509 at Lord’s in 2003.“It was a fantastic feeling,” said Jayawardene of the record-breaking stand, as quoted by BBC. “Kumar and I are very good friends on and off the field and I am privileged to be involved in this with him.” Talking of his personal milestone of passing Jayasuriya’s 340, the previous highest Test score by a Sri Lankan, Jayawardene said, “I’m so proud to have passed Sanath’s record. He’s a great cricketer and it’s something everyone wants to have. I’m absolutely delighted. One day somebody will come along and break that, but right now I have it and that’s a great feeling. There’s a little bit of disappointment that I didn’t get to the 400 mark, but I’m very, very satisfied with what I have achieved.”They say records are meant to be broken, and there probably would come a day when a pair would score more than 624 runs together, given how the game is evolving and progressing. However, emulating ‘Sangawardene’ isn’t a task for mere mortals. What the SSC witnessed on that hot July summer’s day was a once-in-a-lifetime display. It was elegant carnage, so to say.Brief scores:South Africa 169 (AB de Villiers 65; Dilhara Fernando 4 for 48, Muttiah Muralitharan 4 for 41) and 434 (Jacques Rudolph 90, Mark Boucher 85; Muttiah Muralitharan 6 for 131) lost to Sri Lanka 756 for 5 decl.

A suspicious package was left unattended at the venue after which the police closed the venue for inspection and even deployed bomb-sniffing dogs. The match was later reduced to 12-overs-a-side.,CricTracker,"A strange incident took place during the second match of the Global T20 Canada between Montreal Tigers and Winnipeg Hawks. The start of this game was delayed by about 90 minutes resulting in the game being reduced to 12-overs per team. “Play has been delayed due to some technical reasons,” the organisers of the T20 league tweeted 20 minutes after the scheduled start of play.On the other hand, the official broadcaster of the Global T20 Canada shared that the play was delayed due to ‘security issues’. However, there hasn’t been much clarity about the actual reason for this delay. Since then, there have been various speculations but it is now concluded that the start was delayed due to a ‘bomb threat’.AdvertisementFans, who were standing in long queues outside the CAA Centre in Brampton, Ontario weren’t allowed to enter the ground. As per the reports from ESPNCricinfo, they contacted a few players to know the reason behind the delay. It was learnt that a suspicious package was left unattended at the venue. Immediately, the police closed the venue for inspection and even deployed bomb-sniffing dogs.“Routine sniffer dogs checks found a substance that alerted security,” one player told ESPNcricinfo. Moreover, another source revealed that a hole was found in a temporarily constructed perimeter fence that surrounds the cricket portion of the facility. Thus, this raised an alarm and the local police took some preventive measures.After this package was deemed not dangerous, the players were allowed to enter the ground and begin their warm-ups. Later, the reduced match was played without any further interruptions. Montreal Tigers were put in to bat first in this match. Courtesy a 30-ball 59 from Sunil Narine and an unbeaten 23-ball 40 from Anton Devcich helped the team get to 135/3 in 12 overs.The Winnipeg Hawks failed to reach the target in the chase. Umar Akmal and JP Duminy were the only two batsmen who played well. They scored 49 off 30 and 30 off 14 respectively. However, the other batsmen tried to go hard and lost their wickets in the process. The side could only get to 111/5 and lost the game by 24 runs.",https://www.crictracker.com/global-t20-canada-fixture-delayed-due-to-a-bomb-threat/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
55,I would have held back Kohli to no. 4 spot in WC semi: Robin Singh,"Ex-India all-rounder Robin Singh, who has applied for Team India's head coach job, has said that he would have held back Virat Kohli to the number four batting position. ""I would've picked another top-order batsman, Mayank Agarwal, at number 3. MS Dhoni would've been number 5 and he would've got more time. Kohli and Dhoni could've batted together,"" he added.",CricTracker,"One of the most coveted jobs in world cricket, the head coach of the Indian cricket team is open to applications. BCCI invited job applications one day after the conclusion of the 2019 World Cup. The position of the head coach and other positions in the coaching staff are up for grabs.However, current head coach Ravi Shastri and other support staff have been given a 45-day extension. They will travel with the team throughout the tour of West Indies where India will play eight international matches (three T20Is, three ODIs and two Tests).AdvertisementTheir contract will terminate at the end of this tour and India might have a new head coach in September. Top international stars and former coaches Tom Moody, Mahela Jayawardene, and Mike Hesson have all applied for the head coach’s position.Meanwhile, former India all-rounder Robin Singh has also applied for the same. The left-handed batsman played international cricket for more than 12 years. He featured in 136 ODIs but played just one Test match. However, in the last 15 years, he has held various coaching staff roles.He was India’s fielding coach for a three-year period between 2007 and 2009. Singh has been associated with the India ‘A’ and Under 19 teams as well. He has also been a part of Mumbai Indians’ support staff in the IPL. Thus, he does have quite a bit of experience.Ravi Shastri had two different stints with the Indian team in the last few years. he was team director for a couple of years (between 2014 and 2016) before Anil Kumble took over as the head coach for a year. However, Shastri returned in 2017 as the head coach.India have done really well under Shastri. However, their record in ICC knockouts isn’t great. India have lost in the semi-finals of all three ICC events that India played under the former all-rounder – 2015 World Cup, 2016 World T20 and the 2019 World Cup. Thus, Robin Singh feels change can be good for the side.“Under the current coach, India has lost in the semifinals of two successive ODI World Cups, and in the last four stage of the World Twenty20 championship as well. Now is the time to prepare for the 2023 World Cup and a change could be good for the side,” Robin Singh was quoted saying by the Hindu after he sent out his application for the head coach’s role.Robin also revealed what he would have done if he was in Ravi Shastri’s place during India’s World Cup 2019 semi-final against New Zealand.“With the ball moving around and India losing Rohit Sharma early, I would have held back Virat Kohli to the No. 4 slot. For that game, I would have picked another top-order batsman, Mayank Agarwal, at No. 3. MS Dhoni would have been No. 5 and he would have got more time. Kohli and Dhoni could have batted together. Then, we could have had the three power hitters, Hardik Pandya, Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja coming in,” he added.",https://www.crictracker.com/i-would-have-held-back-virat-kohli-to-the-no-4-slot-in-wc-semi-final-india-head-coach-applicant-robin-singh/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
57,I wasn't as true to myself as I could've been: Cameron Bancroft,"Australia batsman Cameron Bancroft, who served a nine-month ban after being involved in ball-tampering scandal, has said he wasn't as true to himself as he could've been. ""One of the big lessons...I learned last year was about being true to yourself,"" he added. ""I made a mistake...I'll learn from it and move forward and get better,"" he further said.",Cricket Australia,"Cameron Bancroft packed more than a remodelled sense of self and a trunk load of resolve when he embarked on his journey to captain Durham in division two of England's county cricket competition earlier this year.Tucked into his suitcase, in its velvet cocoon emblazoned with the Australia coat of arms and embroidered with the number 451, was his treasured Baggy Green Test cricket cap.In preparing for his northern summer sojourn in the northern-most cricket county, Bancroft took with him no expectation the keepsake he'd earned during the 2017-18 Ashes series in Australia would be needed when the battle for the urn resumed in the UK come August.But the power that item of cloth possessed, in reassuring him from where he'd come and wordlessly exhorting him to reclaim his place, made it a vital travel companion that will now accompany him on his return to the Test fraternity.As he served the nine-month ban from international and interstate cricket last year, the cap sat on its regular display post outside his bedroom at home in Perth as a symbol of better times.""It's something you're obviously very proud of,"" Bancroft said today of his Test cap, just hours after learning of his call-up to the 17-man Ashes squad.""It's a very prestigious item to have and you take good care of it because it means something to you … and being able to see that is obviously really good to focus your goals, and where you want to be going.""Upon taking up his post at Durham, which currently sits mid-table on division two's 10-team ladder, Bancroft used the cap as a form of inspiration, knowing that if he rediscovered the form that had won him a Test place 18 months earlier, he was a chance of winning it back.""It's good motivation isn't it?,"" he said.""To look at it and go 'yeah I'm playing cricket but there's something bigger I eventually want to be able to get back to'.""I guess it was good motivation to keep working hard … to keep my goals and keep focused.""Bancroft admits he's a subtly different cricketer, but a markedly different person than the one who completed the fractious Test series in South Africa last year as Australia's leading runs scorer.A self-confessed cricket obsessive prior to that experience, the 26-year-old has found a new equanimity built partly on his embrace of yoga and the related realisation that cricket is a pastime to be enjoyed, not a yoke to labour beneath.Bancroft points out that he still takes the game very seriously and badly wants to succeed at a team and individual level, but takes a far more holistic view of its place within his life and the inherent need that it fills.""I think being serious about cricket is important, but I think it's also about being able to realise the game is just a game of cricket,"" he said.""One of the big lessons that I learned last year was about being true to yourself.""There is no doubt that I wasn’t as true to myself as I could have been at times (but) you learn from mistakes that you make, and you try and be better.   ""At the end of the day, what you do and your actions is completely up to you.  ""I made a mistake, and I’ll learn from it and move forward and get better.""What Bancroft has not yet had an opportunity to encounter along his road to redemption is the level of crowd hostility that Steve Smith and David Warner were regularly subjected to during the recent ICC World Cup in the UK.To date, Bancroft's return to top-level cricket has come in front of far-less partisan cricket fans in Australia and the smaller turn-outs attracted to county fixtures in England and Wales.He has been aware of elements within those crowds that proffer choruses of booing, and has even been ambushed at times by folks asking for his autograph on sheets of sandpaper.Should he win back a place in Australia's starting XI during the upcoming five-Test series against England, he can expect the full treatment afforded Smith and Warner at venues that traditionally fill to capacity on most days hosting Ashes battles.True to his tranquil new self, Bancroft accepts it's an outcome he can't alter and is therefore one upon which he won't expend valuable mental and physical energy.“It’s all right, it doesn’t bother me too much,"" he said of the crowd reception he knows will be waiting.""People will react how they want to react.""Hopefully, I can use it if people want to be like that, to give (me) energy to perform well.""But I can’t control that.""I guess the journey that I’ve been through over the last 18 months, you get exposed to things like that.""I’ll just deal with it and keep moving forward.""With his prized Baggy Green Cap sitting proudly on a very level head. 2019 Qantas Ashes Tour of EnglandAustralia squad: Tim Paine (c), Cameron Bancroft, Pat Cummins, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Michael Neser, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle, Steven Smith, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner.First Test: August 1-5, EdgbastonTour match: Australians v Worcestershire, August 7-9Second Test: August 14-18,Lord'sThird Test: August 22-26, HeadingleyTour match: Australians v Derbyshire, August 29-31Fourth Test: September 4-8, Old TraffordFifth Test: September 12-16, The Oval",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/baggy-green-cameron-bancroft-durham-australia-england-county-cricket-ashes-english-crowds/2019-07-27?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
58,Anil Kumble-led ICC committee to discuss boundary count rule,"Anil Kumble-led ICC Cricket Committee will discuss the issues concerning 2019 World Cup final, including the boundary count back rule which decided the winner of the tournament. ICC's general manager of cricket Geoff Allardice said whether the rule should be different is something the committee will consider at some point. The committee will meet during the first quarter of 2020.",Cricket Country,"The ICC‘s Anil Kumble-led Cricket Committee will discuss issues concerning the epic ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 final, including the controversial boundary count back rule, in its next meeting, said the apex body’s general manager of cricket Geoff Allardice.Cricketers – current and former – shared New Zealand‘s pain on losing the World Cup title to hosts England on boundary count back rule following an epic final at the Lord’s on July 14.In a pulsating encounter, England were adjudged the winners of the World Cup on the basis of their superior boundary count – 22 fours and two sixes – to New Zealand’s 17 after the match ended in a tie after regulation play and subsequent Super Over.“The cricket committee will consider any issues arising from the World Cup final when it next meets (in the first quarter of 2020),” Allardice was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.“A Super Over has been used to determine a winner in a tied match in ICC events since 2009 (replacing the bowl-out), and the tiebreaker after a tied Super Over needed to be derived from something that happened in that particular match. So, it has always related to the number of boundaries scored in the match.” (ALSO READ: ICC defends umpire Dharmasena’s overthrows call during World Cup final)Continuing, he said the boundary count back rule was followed as it is in practice in T20 leagues across the world.“Almost all the T20 leagues around the world also use boundaries as the tiebreaker in their Super Overs. We wanted to use the same Super Over regulations that are used across all professional cricket and that’s why it was the way it was. Whether it should be different is something that our cricket committee will consider at some point,” Allardice said.The ICC’s chief executives committee (CEC) did not deliberate at its annual conference on whether sharing the World Cup could be an option in future.“No, that wasn’t discussed. The consistent view has been that the World Cup final needs a winner, and a Super Over was in the playing conditions to decide a tied final in each of the last three World Cups,” he said.Virat Kohli has said that he has been looking forward to the World Test Championship, which begins with the Ashes 2019 on August 1, and Allardice said it is encouraging.“Yes, it is very encouraging to hear those comments. I know players love playing Test cricket. For the first time there is a real context to the matches they play that extends beyond a particular series.“I know the Test rankings have done a good job over a long period of time in the sense of identifying the best team, but to be able to compete on a points table and play for a spot in the final will add a new element to Test cricket and will make it more interesting to people from the countries not involved in that particular match,” Allardice said.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/anil-kumble-led-icc-cricket-committee-to-decide-on-controversial-boundary-back-rule-873052?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

81,"BCCI confirms Kohli to hold press conference on Monday, shares details",The BCCI has confirmed that Virat Kohli will hold a pre-departure press conference before leaving for West Indies tour. The BCCI stated Kohli will address the press conference at Mumbai's ITC Maratha at 6 PM on Monday. This comes after several reports stated that Kohli had decided against holding the press conference amid rumours of his rift with Rohit Sharma.,Times Now,"Indian captain Virat Kohli will be addressing a press conference on the eve of team's departure for the upcoming West Indies tour on Monday, contrary to several media reports which claimed he might give it a miss. Amid speculations of a rift between Kohli and vice-captain Rohit Sharma, questions over the said unsettled atmosphere in the Indian cricket team's dressing room are expected to take over the media interaction. After India's semi-final exit from ICC World Cup 2019, Kohli's captaincy was put under scrutiny with several media reports claiming that all was not well between the skipper and his deputy.However, Kohli and Rohit remain an integral part of the Indian team. There were also claims that the selection committee might consider the option of split captaincy by handing over the ODI leadership to Rohit, who many experts even backed to take over the reins from Kohli. However, rubbishing all such rumours the selection panel headed by MSK Prasad, earlier this week announced the squads for the West Indies tour while confirming Kohli as the captain in all three formats.There were several reports claiming that Kohli might snub the pre-departure pressure owing to explanations on the speculated division in the Indian dressing room, however, the Indian skipper will talk to the media on Monday, confirmed a BCCI press release. Kohli has so far enjoyed great success as a captain having led India to historic Test series win in Australia and ODI series victories in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.However, he is yet to prove his mettle in major ICC events after India's failure in the knockout stages of two big tournaments - Champions Trophy 2017 and World Cup 2019. Kohli was in fine form with the bat in the recently-concluded World Cup where he notched up 443 runs in nine games at an average of over 55. He will be looking to carry his purple patch into the Windies series as India look for a fresh start after a disappointing exit from the showpiece event.India are scheduled to play three T20Is, as many ODIs and two Test matches against West Indies starting from August 3. The Men in Blue will play two T20Is in Florida before heading to the Caribbean to play the rest of the matches. The selectors have included several young promising talents in the squad in a bid to identify the right players for future with the World T20 to be staged next year.

She fell before the train was about to enter the Krantivira Sangolli Rayanna (Bengaluru City) station. She died on the way to hospital after a primary checkup at a clinic.,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: In one of the rarest accidents to have taken place inside a train, a 40-year-old woman who slipped when alighting from the upper berth of an AC coach died within a couple of hours due to suspected internal injuries. The incident took place on July 22 inside the Udyan Express, which was heading to Bengaluru from Mumbai. The deceased, Saraswathi Banisal, a Kolkata native, was employed at Jayanagar. It is not clear whether she was employed in a beauty parlour or ran her own outlet here. She was returning from Mumbai where she had been on a short visit to enhance her skills, a source said.  A bit overweight, Banisal fell from the berth when she tried to alight from the berth well before it was to enter the Krantivira Sangolli Rayanna (Bengaluru City) railway station, said a railway official. “One of the passengers tweeted to the Railway Ministry about her fall. The Government Railway Police, railway officials and doctors were immediately alerted. Medical help was waiting on Platform three for the arrival of the train,” the official said. Dr S Snehalatha, general physician at a free clinic run by Manipal Hospitals in the concourse area of the station, said, “Two of our paramedical staff rushed to the station at 8.30 am. The train reached only after 9 am due to delays. They entered the compartment and checked all of her vital parameters which were alright. The patient was answering basic questions coherently and looked alright. They later brought her to the clinic on a stretcher.” En route, she even kept telling the police to be careful about her bag as it contained valuables. At the clinic too, her condition was assessed and initially she sounded okay. “However, her speech soon became blurred and she kept forgetting to answer a basic question like her residence in  Bengaluru. Since we suspected an internal head injury to be causing a loss of consciousness, we decided to rush her by ambulance to the nearby KC General Hospital,” Dr Snehalatha said. Apart from a nurse from the clinic, the ambulance also had a nurse and a GRP cop accompanying her. Later, the doctor received a call from the staff on board that the oxygen level was saturating. “I told them to increase the oxygen supply since they were nearing the hospital. As they reached the hospital, there was no response from her. Doctors waiting for the ambulance outside conducted a few basic tests and declared her as brought dead,” she added.The patient may have suffered from a spinal cord injury or an internal head injury which only the post mortem report will make clear, she said. TNSE spoke to Alpana, her younger sister in Kolkata, who said she was unaware if her sister had any previous health condition as she lived away from home for most of her life. Avoid upper berths if you have health issues: DocDr Snehalatha said, “The exact reason for the woman’s death on board the train will be clear when we see the autopsy report. However, as a matter of caution, it is better for those suffering from BP or sugar problems to avoid occupying middle or upper berths in trains. We do not know when the impact of high or low BP or sugar levels can happen.”It could be dangerous if one loses control when alighting or boarding the berths, the doctor added.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2019/jul/28/woman-dies-after-falling-from-upper-berth-of-bengaluru-bound-train-2010548.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

With the exception of the 2010/11 series in Australia, which England won 3-1, home advantage has been decisive since Waugh's side triumphed 4-1 away in 2001.But the former Australia captain, 54, said it was ""50-50"" as to who would emerge triumphant over the course of the five Tests starting at Edgbaston on Thursday.""I really believe it's a big ask for the fast bowlers on both sides to play five Tests in six weeks and that could have a big impact on the whole series, so for instance Jimmy Anderson gets injured, or Mitchell Starc gets injured for us, it could really affect the line-up.""Depth in the squad will be important but I honestly think if I was a betting man I wouldn't back either side because I don't know who's going to win. It's going to be that even. I think it's going to be a fantastic series.""Waugh, who is mentoring the Australians, said it was a mystery why Australia had not won in England for so long but his advice to the players would be to ""make your own history"".""We've come up against some really good England sides in those last 18 years. We've had some tight series and moments when we could have won the series, probably a bit like the other way round for England in that period where they lost a lot.""- World Cup boost? -England go into the series buoyed by winning the World Cup for the first time -- they beat 2015 champions Australia in the semi-final -- but Waugh said that triumph would have no impact on the Ashes.""One-day cricket is irrelevant to Test cricket,"" he said. ""They're different teams, different captains. It's a different sport really. If you compare Test cricket and one-day cricket you're almost not playing the same sport. It's played in a totally different way.""England will say it's important for everyone and sure, if you win that's great but when it comes to the first Test at Edgbaston it's not going to matter what happened in the one-day World Cup.""The first Test is taking place in Birmingham, where England have not lost since 2008, but Waugh said he would be telling his players to put that out of their minds. ""I've won there in Ashes contests,"" he said. ""I think if you start believing something and building it up it becomes true but in my mind it shouldn't be an issue.""The former skipper, known for his uncompromising approach on the field, said he expected some rough treatment from English crowds for Steve Smith and Dave Warner.The two batsman were each banned for 12 months over their involvement in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year. Cameron Bancroft, also named in the Test squad, was banned for nine months. But Waugh said Australia had turned a corner.""Australia had to reset and revisit a few things, which is unfortunate because of what happened. I think they're in good shape. (Test captain) Tim Paine's done a really good job and he's a good leader. Hopefully you'll still see the Australian team play the Aussie way on the field. ""We've got to be combative and play in a positive frame of mind because that's the way we play our cricket.""He added: ""Things culminated in Cape Town and were out of control there and there were a couple of ordinary series between different sides.... It did get to the point when it was over the top and something needed to be done so unfortunately for the guys involved they were the ones that paid the price.""The good thing is now that everyone knows where the line is and you can't cross that line. It was great for kids too because kids all round the world saw that, particularly in Australia, and it was a good lesson as to what's right and wrong.""

It's difficult to understand if Parliament has performed better, brought more laws and made more required changes, Yadav added. Seventeen Opposition parties had written to Rajya Sabha Chairman claiming bills were passed without any scrutiny.",The New Indian Express,"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Sunday refuted the Opposition's claim that the Narendra Modi government has been passing bills without scrutiny by parliamentary committees, saying it sent 17 draft legislations to these panels in Rajya Sabha between 2014-19 while the preceding UPA dispensation sent only five during 2009-14.Taking a dig at opposition leaders, BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav, a key party face in the Upper House, said it is surprising that they are objecting to Parliament utilising more of its time to enact laws.They have problem with the fact that Parliament has enhanced its productive hours and performing better than ever, he said in a statement, adding that it is difficult to understand their objection if the House has performed better, brought more laws and made more required changes, which is its primary function.As many as 17 opposition parties recently wrote to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, accusing the government of ""hurriedly passing"" legislations without any parliamentary scrutiny.The issue flared up after the treasury benches managed support of several regional parties to pass the RTI bill in Rajya Sabha despite stiff opposition from the Congress, TMC and the Left among others.The Opposition had in the past often managed to have its way in this House due to its superior numbers after the government easily managed to get Lok Sabha's nod to its bills thanks to the big majority the BJP-led NDA has in the Lower House.The allegation that in the Rajya Sabha Bills are not properly scrutinised by the Parliamentary Committees is absolutely wrong, Yadav said.Attacking the Opposition for stalling Rajya Sabha proceedings often, he said those disrupting short discussions and calling attention sessions after sessions in Rajya Sabha are the ones who are raising question on the functioning of the House.""Members who are talking about work of Parliament must collectively introspect that why Monsoon Session 2015, Budget Session 2018, Winter Session 2018 and interim Budget Session 2019 were washed out (in Rajya Sabha).It is also surprising to see that instead of participating in the discussion in the House, they have been busy creating obstacles and are now raising issues with it performance,"" the BJP leader said.He highlighted that while four sessions were washed out, the total number of short duration discussions were 29 against 27 during the UPA rule of 2009-14.Yadav said many bills awaiting the Rajya Sabha's nod are the ones which have been scrutinised and approved by parliamentary panels like select committee or standing committee. Most of them have been passed by Lok Sabha.He gave the examples of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, the triple talaq bill the National Medical Commission Bill, the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill 2019, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, the Code of Wages Bill, the Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill and the Companies Amendment Bill.After a long time, the Rajya Sabha has witnessed productive long hours.""Parliament sessions have been irregular due to interruptions and unnecessary interventions. We should not forget that law making is Parliament's primary function. The constructive feedback and intervention of the opposition plays an important role but opposition for the sake of opposition, should not be encouraged,"" Yadav said.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jul/28/surprising-that-opposition-objecting-to-parliament-utilising-more-time-to-enact-laws-bjp-2010691.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

I could not raise the issue in the House as it was adjourned after the voting,” Bhargava said.Congress MLA Sanjay Yadav, however, said that Bhargava was present in the House that time and he should have himself checked the voting procedure then. “Nobody had stopped him then. Why is he complaining now?” he asked. “In fact, their 50 members (legislators) were not present in the House,” Yadav said and alleged that the BJP was in the habit of speaking lies.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

99,Hinduism being defamed in the name of mob lynching: RSS chief,"RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said there is a conspiracy to defame Hindu religion and culture in the name of mob lynching and cows. ""As part of this conspiracy, conversion of religion is being done in some states,"" Bhagwat added. This comes days after 49 celebrities wrote an open letter to PM Modi over the mob lynching incidents across the country.",Times Now,"Mathura: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that Hinduism has been defamed in the name of cows and mob lynching, adding that it is a plot to defame the religion. Bhagwat gave this statement while addressing an RSS event in Mathura.Bhagwat’s reaction comes after 49 celebrities from different backgrounds penned an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling for an end to mob lynching and demanded exemplary action against the perpetrators.In the letter, they also pointed out that 254 religious identity-based hate crimes were reported between January 1, 2009, and October 29, 2018, regretting that not much has been done to tackle the issue.Speaking to Times Now, NCP leader Majeed Memon said that no one was criticising Hindu religion but certain goons who may have some affiliation with religious groups. He also blamed the ruling dispensation of not doing enough to put an end to such hate crimes taking place all over the country.  After this open letter, 62 celebrities, including actress Kangana Ranaut and writer-lyricist Prasoon Joshi, brought a counter open letter slamming the 49 celebrities for their selective outrage and false narratives.“Forty-nine self-styled guardians and conscience keepers of the nation and of democratic values have once again expressed selective concern and demonstrated clear political bias and motive,"" the letter reads.The counter open letter slammed the 49 personalities saying that their concerns smack of dishonesty and opportunism.The letter further says that under Modi regime people have maximum liberty to differ, to criticise and to abuse government and the dispensation in power, adding that the spirit of dissent has never been stronger.The letter also urged the celebrities to “give up being selective and condemn lynching, discrimination and desecration of religious places with equal vehemence when they occur”.Calling the letter an attempt to create a false sense of fear and seige and to try and derail India's march towards collective empowerment, the 62 celebrities termed it an attempt to defame the nation.Last year in September, the RSS chief had said that Hindutva means inclusivity and accepting Muslims is a part of it.Speaking on Hindu Rashtra, he further said that it doesn’t mean that there won’t be any place for the Muslims. “If we don't accept Muslims then it's not Hindutva. Hindutva is Indianess and inclusivity,” he had said.Bhagwat later said that Hindutva binds everyone together, adding that the RSS vision of Hindutva is not meant to oppose or demean anyone. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/plot-to-defame-hindu-religion-in-the-name-of-mob-lynching-and-cows-says-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat/460350?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Heavy water can be employed in reactors to produce plutonium, a fuel used in nuclear warheads. Iran stopped complying in May with some commitments in the 2015 nuclear deal.",Reuters,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, told lawmakers on Sunday that Iran will restart activities at the Arak heavy water nuclear reactor, the ISNA news agency reported. ISNA cited a member of parliament who attended the meeting. Heavy water can be employed in reactors to produce plutonium, a fuel used in nuclear warheads. Iran stopped complying in May with some commitments in the 2015 nuclear deal that was agreed with global powers, after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018 and re-introduced sanctions on Tehran.       The remaining signatories have tried to hold the nuclear deal together, an increasingly difficult task as tensions between Washington and Tehran have soared in recent weeks. Later on Sunday, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China will meet Iran in Vienna to discuss how to save the accord in an extraordinary meeting. On July 3, President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran would increase its uranium enrichment levels and start to revive its Arak heavy-water reactor after July 7 if the nations in the nuclear pact did not protect trade with Iran promised under the deal but blocked by the U.S. sanctions. The reduction of commitments can be reversed, Iranian officials have said, if the remaining signatories to the deal uphold their promises.  Western powers have said Iran’s nuclear ambitions must be curbed due to their concerns that Tehran intends to build nuclear weapons. Tehran denies this.  The meeting on Sunday of the Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the deal’s formal name, will be chaired by the EU foreign policy service’s Secretary General Helga Schmid.

""I would humbly request respective media channels on @youtube to stop uploading such ridiculous videos as I have a family to answer [to] and it creates problems for me,"" she wrote.",SpotboyE,"Actress Urvashi Rautela is seeking the limelight again. The actress is known to grab attention and tabloid space for her antics. This is another one of those instances, perhaps. Urvashi has taken to her social media, to ask media channels on YouTube to stop sharing videos of her relationship with Hardik Pandya, as it creates problems for her in her family.

As you may recall, SpotboyE.com broke the news of Urvashi’s growing fondness for Hardik. The actress who met him at a party, in 2018, hit it off immediately with the Pandya brothers, but the one who caught her attention was Hardik. A recent video shared on YouTube has caught the attention of the actress, and it seems she is quite upset about it. Urvashi took to her Instagram to share a screenshot of the video that headlined, “Urvashi Rautela seeks help of ex-boyfriend,” featuring Hardik Pandya and Urvashi’s picture. Responding to this video, Urvashi said, “ I would humbly request respective media channels on @youtube to stop uploading such ridiculous videos as I have a family to answer and it creates problems for me.”

Urvashi has denied her inclination towards Hardik, amd their meeting and bond is lost over time. Recently, Urvashi has been in news for her messaging spree to Hardik Pandya to arrange two passes for the recently held India Vs Pakistan World Cup 2019 match at Old Trafford, Manchester. The cricketer did not pay any heed to the actresses’ messages as he was busy preparing for his matches. Ultimately, the poor Rautela lost her opportunity to cheer for Team India from the Trafford stands.

116,I can play a big part in 2019 Ashes: Australia pacer Siddle,"Talking ahead of 2019 Ashes which commences on Thursday, Australia pacer Peter Siddle said, ""I think I can play a big part in this series."" The 34-year-old, who has taken 214 wickets in 64 Tests, added, ""I'm definitely bowling a lot better...in these [English] conditions."" Siddle further said that playing with English county side Essex helped him learn a lot.",Cricket Australia,"Justin Langer received uncomfortably clear confirmation of the fighting qualities within Peter Siddle when the raw young quick played his first Sheffield Shield game more than a dozen years ago.But it was with bat, rather than shiny new ball in hand that the then 22-year-old came to the attention of the current men's team coach, who has remained an enduring presence in Siddle's career ever since.As Langer's Western Australia pressed for victory at the MCG in a 2006-07 match the recently retired Test opener had dominated (scoring 108 and 99), Siddle hung in for more than an hour to salvage a draw in partnership with Victoria's number 11 batter, Darren Pattinson (older brother of Australia quick, James Pattinson).Langer might have cursed Siddle's doggedness that afternoon, but when he was appointed Test team batting coach soon after, he forged a strong bond with Siddle.It's no surprise, therefore, that in pulling together his first Ashes squad since taking over the senior coaching role last year, Langer has called on the services of the now 34-year-old Siddle who has become something of a master at bowling in English conditions.For his part, Siddle credits Langer for helping to keep the competitive flame kindling within him after a frustrating 2015 Ashes tour and then a serious back injury the following year that left him doubting if he would ever again don his treasured Baggy Green Cap.Having spent more than 12 months regaining fitness and form, Siddle took up a playing contract with county team Essex in 2018, not long after Langer assumed the role of national coach.Siddle recalled today how a simple, single line text message that arrived from Langer after the seamer turned in another impressive performance for Essex was sufficient to reboot his quest to play more Tests.""He said 'just remember that every game counts' … and that's what I've done,"" Siddle said, a day after learning of his inclusion in Australia's 17-man squad for the Ashes series that gets underway at Edgbaston on Thursday.""I'm definitely bowling a lot better than I ever have in these (English) conditions, and that's the best thing I bring to this team now.""I know I've done well. I've got a pretty good record in Ashes Test matches in England, but through my experience over the last couple of years (with Essex) I've learned a lot of new skills.""So I think I can play a big part in this series.""It's a vastly different mindset to that which Siddle carried during the latter stages of his previous Ashes tour to the UK, in 2015.Having shown his suitability to bowling with the Dukes brand ball in English conditions during a term with county team Nottinghamshire the previous northern summer, Siddle was seen as a perfect fit for the crucial fourth Test of the 2015 Ashes campaign at his former home ground, Trent Bridge.On a humid, cloudy morning with the pitch that Siddle knew so well showing a seamer's delight, he was overlooked and watched from the dressing room as his Notts teammate Stuart Broad tore through Australia in the first session to claim 8-15.As Siddle remembers, it was the lowest point of a cricket career that has known its share of setbacks.""It was very tough, it's probably one of the toughest times,"" Siddle said today.""I know injuries are always a tough thing, you can deal with that and it's not too bad.""But I think missing out on opportunities … you always believe you should be picked, that's how you should feel, but when you see conditions that are suited to you, that's when it hurts the most.""I remember at Trent Bridge just after being told I wasn't part of that Test match, the boys were warming up and I went and had a conversation with Punter (Ricky Ponting, working as a television commentator) out in the middle of the field.""We were looking at the wicket and he couldn’t believe that I wasn't playing, and that's when I said to him 'if I'm not getting picked here, I don't think I'll ever get picked again'.""And that was the honest truth - I thought at that time I mightn't get another opportunity to play.""As events transpired, fellow quick Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the final Test at The Oval two weeks later and Siddle was recalled, taking six wickets in Australia's consolation win by an innings and 46 runs.However, barely six months later, Siddle was sidelined with stress fractures in his back and that problem flared again later in 2016 when he took the opportunity to also undergo surgery on an ankle problem that had long plagued him.Given he was already on the far side of 30, and had struggled to reach his previous bowling speeds immediately prior to the injury, Siddle understood there was a strong chance his days of playing international cricket were done.But ever the optimist, he also viewed the enforced break as a chance to reset the clock and refocus his aspirations.""That last injury I had when I wrecked my ankle and hurt my back at the same time, it probably came at the right time,"" Siddle said.""I think if it had of been a year or two later, it would have been hard to come back from there, and I probably would have been done.""But it gave me just a little chance, a little window to have another crack at trying to represent Australia.""I had a good 15 months where I could freshen up and get it 100 per cent right and get fit, which I hadn’t been in a long time, to a position now where I think I'm consistently hitting good (bowling) speeds.""What Siddle has also learned from his time in county cricket – firstly alongside Broad at Nottinghamshire, and now with ex-England Test skipper Sir Alastair Cook at Essex – is to never discount a player on the basis of age.He points to James Anderson, England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker who turns 37 on Tuesday, as the shining example of a fast bowler who has proved even more potent in the autumn years of his career.It's not only the skills that Anderson has honed throughout a 16-year Test career that serve him so well, but also his capacity to read and react to all manner of ambient and match conditions, Siddle believes.And that's a trait that he shares with 33-year-old Broad, England's second-highest all-time Test wicket-taker and the other half of the most successful new-ball pairing the game has seen.Siddle claimed that if he and his fellow Australia quicks can emulate the skills and the smarts of Anderson and Broad, they could be well on the way to their first Ashes series win on British soil since 2001.""(Anderson) plays the conditions well, he understands the overheads, the wickets, what it looks like, the times that they're bowling,"" Siddle said.""He knows whether to be really aggressive and try to take wickets, or hold back a little bit and try to contain and build pressure and get wickets as a team.""I think that's one of the big keys in England.""When I've played my stints on the county circuit, that's the main basis of the team set-up.""If the conditions are right you be can really aggressive and try and take wickets, and then there are other times when the sun's out and the wicket has dulled a little bit, and there mightn't be as much happening.""So you might have to be patient and build pressure.""He and Broad together have shown, over the years, that by doing that they can have great results and I think that's something we can take out of it.""Their game plan - we can try and mimic that throughout this series, and I think the closer we can get to being like that gives us our best chance.""2019 Qantas Ashes Tour of EnglandAustralia squad: Tim Paine (c), Cameron Bancroft, Pat Cummins, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Michael Neser, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle, Steven Smith, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner.First Test: August 1-5, EdgbastonTour match: Australians v Worcestershire, August 7-9Second Test: August 14-18,Lord'sThird Test: August 22-26, HeadingleyTour match: Australians v Derbyshire, August 29-31Fourth Test: September 4-8, Old TraffordFifth Test: September 12-16, The Oval",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/peter-siddle-justin-langer-2015-australia-england-ashes-injury-jimmy-anderson-stuart-broad/2019-07-28?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Its provisions declined 41.5% year-on-year in the quarter to â‚¹3,496 crore, with bad loans falling 51%. The bank's net interest income rose 27% to â‚¹7,737 crore year-on-year for the quarter.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - ICICI Bank Ltd, India’s second-largest private lender, reported a quarterly profit on Saturday compared with a loss a year earlier, helped by lower provisions and higher retail loan growth. Net profit for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30 was 19.08 billion rupees ($277.04 million), compared with a loss of 1.20 bln rupees in the same period a year ago, the bank said in a statement. But the profit fell slightly short of the average forecast of 20.87 billion rupees from 19 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. ICICI, like its peers, also said India’s ongoing economic slowdown weighed on its performance in the quarter. “From an economic scenario there is a bit of a slowdown in consumption as well as in auto sales,” said Sandeep Batra, Executive Director of ICICI Bank in a conference call after the results. “However, the services sector continues to do well and we are seeing an improvement in the capital expenditure cycle.”  The bank’s corporate loan book grew at a pace of 13% in the quarter, while its retail loan book grew 22% in the period. ICICI, which has been under pressure lately due to rising bad loans, said net non-performing assets (NPA) at the end of the June quarter were down 51% to $1.17 billion. The net NPA was at a 14-quarter low of 1.77%, said the bank’s management.  Quarterly provisions fell to $507 million from $865 million a year ago.  Net interest margin, a key indicator of the bank’s profitability, was 3.61% in the quarter, compared with 3.19% in the year-ago quarter. The total capital adequacy ratio of the bank was 16.19% and it does not have any immediate plans to raise capital, said Batra. Earlier in the week, ICICI’s peer Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd also reported a profit that fell marginally shy of estimates, and joined the country’s largest private lender HDFC Bank in warning of the slowing pace of domestic growth.  The warnings from the private lenders in Asia’s third largest economy, which have been dealing with a large pile of stressed loans, have spooked investors.

""One of the amazing things I've been seeing here in India is just how WhatsApp has become a way of people doing business,"" he said. He added that he's working with the Indian government to launch WhatsApp Payments.",YourStory,"WhatsApp, the private messaging app of social networking giant Facebook Inc, has become India’s preferred mode of communication. With over 400 million users, including more than a million businesses, India is WhatsApp’s fastest-growing market.WhatsApp Global Head Will CathcartIndia is also WhatsApp’s ‘most important’ market and a ‘huge part of the future for WhatsApp,’ WhatsApp Global Head Will Cathcart told me during an exclusive interaction in Mumbai, where I caught up with the man steering the platform beyond private messaging to other solutions like payments.To be sure, in less than a decade since its launch in India, such is its ubiquity that you no longer ‘message’ a person, you ‘WhatsApp’ them. Indeed, both individuals and businesses across the country have found myriad ways of using WhatsApp. Many small and medium businesses in India, seen as the backbone of the country, have also taken to the app to grow their businesses and offer personalised solutions. All this has enabled the creation of new products and solutions, such as WhatsApp Business and the soon-to-be-launched WhatsApp Payments offering.Indeed, WhatsApp’s success in India explains why Facebook chose the market to test out its payments solution. Will Cathcart, who is currently in India, put all speculation to rest about the company’s payments solution, and announced that the social messaging app is all set to launch its much-anticipated WhatsApp Payments feature in India this year. Will told YourStory that WhatsApp’s strategy around payments is very much a partnership model and an India-specific one. The company, which is currently working with the Indian government on the launch of WhatsApp Payments, is keen to work with banks in India to enable their business to reach customers who are using WhatsApp, Will added.But WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Payments may just be the start of several India-specific solutions as the company continues to add new features based on feedback from users. “For product development, we're starting to think, how do we go listen to what people are doing in India? Based on that, we see what to add… A feature we recently added is product catalogues in the small business app where you can keep a track of the products you have with photos and share them with potential customers when they want to see what you offer. But I think there's going to be tons more we can do,” he added.In collaboration with YourStory, WhatsApp released ‘A Billion Opportunities’ coffee table book that showcases Indian SMBs making an impact. The book was released at WhatsApp Business for small and medium businesses event in New Delhi on Thursday.WhatsApp Global Head Will Cathcart with NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh KantRead the full excerpt of my interview below.Shradha Sharma: At the time of your appointment, Mark Zuckerberg said, and I quote, “(Will is) always focused on solving the most important problems for people and clear-eyed about the challenges and tradeoffs we face.” As you’re aware, many of our readers are startups, entrepreneurs, and small business owners who are encountering these challenges and problems every day. Share with us your learnings on how they can emulate this. Will Cathcart: Well, Mark's very nice to say that. I guess I've been lucky enough to be working at Facebook for nine years now. My background is in product management and so I worked on a lot of our consumer-facing products ranging from newsfeed to the introduction of video and live video to Facebook groups. One of the things we've done that I think has served us well is focus a lot on the ways people are taking the products we've already built and using them in ways we didn't plan for. For example, we saw tons of people using Facebook groups around a certain interest and then buying and selling things with it. We hadn't built anything into it that was about commerce. So, one of our teams asked, can we build a product like a Facebook marketplace? And that's something I've always tried to focus on in the projects I've taken up. And I think our teams have done a good job building a culture around that. Coming to WhatsApp, one of the things I was really excited about was seeing just how people are taking such a simple product and using it in increasing ways around their lives. One of the amazing things I've been seeing here in India is just how WhatsApp has become a way of people doing business. If you're a small business, how much of it runs on WhatsApp? Even though it was originally conceived to help people communicate with friends and family, people are using it in amazing ways. And that's given us an opportunity to build products for that like the small business app.  Shradha Sharma: What I hear you saying is that Facebook and WhatsApp have always been listening very closely to the customers and that's how you look at the impact, right?  Will Cathcart: Yes. It's been really wonderful because it's given us these areas to work on that we know people are going to find useful and valuable because they're already using our products even if they're less efficient for it. Just to go back to the WhatsApp example. I think the team knew that if we made a business app for small businesses, it would do well because we had already seen small businesses using WhatsApp. We knew if we gave them something with extra tools that were responding to their needs, it would be great for them and we would have millions of people using the app. And the small business app is growing quickly.  Shradha Sharma: While coming for the interview in this room, I went to the business centre and asked someone for the WhatsApp office. The person got talking and said, ‘WhatsApp has changed my life. It's the best thing that has happened.’ It is like that for everyone in India. Of course, you are building for your customers and seeing them use the product in different ways. But what has been very exciting for you in this role?  Will Cathcart: It's exciting and humbling to work on something that so many people love and use. And find that it's changed their life or business. I think what's been really exciting for me is it reminds me a lot of when I came to Facebook nine years ago. Here's a product that I use and I love and I'm seeing tons of other people use it.  There are lots of opportunities, based on what we're hearing from the people who use WhatsApp, for us to go build things for them that will help their lives, better their communication with their friends, and help their businesses. That is really exciting for me. It's like a chance to join something that is amazing and see what we can do to improve it. Shradha Sharma: I am always intrigued when meeting someone like you. How do you get to be where you are because when you started, there must have been thousands of people, right? But today you're in this role. For all the youngsters and all the business owners reading this, how do you get to scale yourself and be as a professional here? Will Cathcart: I think I’ve just been very lucky. I have had a lot of help from great managers and people I've worked with. And I have always tried to find what products someone will really want. Why this will make the lives of our customers better, and be really, really focussed on what's the one thing I can do to help, and keep doing that over and over again and keep getting lucky.  Shradha Sharma: You know, data privacy has been a major cause for concern and WhatsApp has put in place several measures to address privacy concerns. Data encryption is an extremely fundamental core to what you're building. Can you tell us about that because it is  one of the biggest conversations in the country?Will Cathcart: We think it's really fundamental to the product. If you think about the core of WhatsApp, it's helping you have a conversation with someone as if the two of you were sitting together without anyone else in the room. My wife and I travel for work, and I work pretty far away from our Facebook campuses. Since my wife and I are away a lot of the time, we have all our conversations over WhatsApp. That’s how we keep in touch through the day. Now that I'm on this trip, I'm sending her photos constantly. And we want to feel like we are talking in the same room - privately. You need to know that no one else is listening. It's a core feature of WhatsApp that it can't see what you're saying. WhatsApp is also doing everything it can to minimise what data we collect about what's going on so that you can feel free to say anything to your spouse, friend, or your family that you wouldn't feel free to say if it felt like other people might be around sitting in on the conversation or following up later.  Shradha Sharma: Do you have a defined privacy policy? Are you evolving that?  Will Cathcart: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we have a strongly defined policy. We have our privacy policy on our website. But at a high level, the approach is really to try to get as close as we can to this idea of a private face-to-face conversation where WhatsApp is not involved. That means three things: One, encrypting the conversation. Collecting as little data as we need to run the service. A great example of this that blew me away was you can share your location, even your live location, with someone else. The team went out of their way to build it in a way where WhatsApp never sees the location. We never find out where you are. It's just between you and the other person. This makes sense because you're sharing  sensitive information and it helps you be safe and secure to know that no one else can see it. Second, there are some things where we do need more data for some services but we're always going to try to push how hard we can go with keeping as little data as possible. And then the third one is the way the product works. Trying to focus on features that match private face-to-face communication. It's one of the reasons why status, for example, can be seen only by your friends or people in your address book. And, we have wonderful versions of that on Instagram and Facebook, but we really want WhatsApp to focus on private communication. So we've chosen features that we think line-up with that.Shradha Sharma: How important is India as a market for you because everyone is using WhatsApp here? Will Cathcart: I mean, it is the most important one if you look at how many people use WhatsApp in India today and what the potential is. It's a huge part of the future for WhatsApp and for the world. And so it's one of the reasons why I'm here. And we built our first-of-a-kind team in India as we really see it as the future. Shradha Sharma: Do you track the stories - the impact WhatsApp is creating in this country? Will Cathcart: We're working on more ways to scale some of the analysis and measure this. But the team really gets incredibly pumped, excited, and inspired hearing how people are taking WhatsApp and using it to change their life, drive their business, and have a huge transformational impact. Shradha Sharma: What type of businesses have you tied up with? BookMyShow is on the platform. How is that going? How invested is WhatsApp to make that big here because it's still on trial?  Will Cathcart: It’s early days but we think the opportunity is huge, particularly with small businesses. We're very invested in it and looking at what new features we can bring to the platform based on how we're seeing people use WhatsApp today. Shradha Sharma: WhatsApp payment gateway is another thing that is being talked about here. When is that happening? Will Cathcart: We're eager to have it launched soon. You see how many people are driving their small businesses through WhatsApp with their customers and think, if we had the ability for them to accept payments through WhatsApp or for people to send money to each other over WhatsApp, it would be hugely impactful and meaningful for people's businesses. So we're really excited and we're working with the government to figure out how to launch it. Shradha Sharma: Last week, I met the CEO of HDFC Bank, which is the most valuable private bank in India. One of the things he said was that for digital payment platforms, the important thing is that they don't own the customer and the ones who own will lead. But HDFC owns the customer and they are looking at partnering with such digital platforms. And, of course, he also mentioned WhatsApp. I was just wondering how open are you to partnering with different banks? Will Cathcart: We’re actually working with banks and viewing this as a partnership. We are a platform for communication with people and we want to help facilitate commercial communication. But the right way to do that is with partners who have banking relationships with customers. We just want to help by being a platform to facilitate more transactions. I think of our strategy around payments is very much a partnership model and it is very much an India-specific model. We started working on payments as there is a tremendous opportunity. So we want to work with banks in India to enable their business to reach customers who are using WhatsApp. Shradha Sharma: Is there something else besides payment and WhatsApp for Business that you are thinking about in the context of the Indian market? Will Cathcart: Some of the things we've released recently have actually been specific to or first in India. For example, we just launched the ability to get permissions around who can add you to groups. We hear a lot of feedback from people in India about being added to groups. So, for product development, we're starting to think, how do we go listen to what people are doing in India? Based on that, we see what to add. In particular, what I'm really excited about this trip is the impact we're already having with small businesses. And finding out what more we can do. Payments are one natural thing that will help accelerate businesses. But what else can we do to help them manage their business through WhatsApp? A feature we recently added is product catalogues in the small business app where you can keep a track of the products you have with photos and share them with potential customers when they want to see what you offer. But I think there's going to be tons more we can do.Shradha Sharma: At some point, you are looking at a more tighter integration of WhatsApp with Facebook and Instagram, all which have so many users in India. How can all the three products talk to each other more closely?  Will Cathcart: Yeah, this is something we've talked about at a high level. Mark's talked about how he thinks our products can work together and help make people's lives easier. We see small businesses using Facebook and then putting their phone number and saying, “Reach me on WhatsApp”. So yeah, one thing we've thought about exploring is are there ways for us to make that easier for people? We don't have any of the concrete specifics yet.   Shradha Sharma: It’s amazing that you have nearly a decade’s experience in Facebook, having led the role of running the Facebook app and made it what it is today. And now, you’ve taken on this global role of heading WhatsApp. On a personal level, what does this mean for you? I ask this because I also hear it’s close to your heart, as your wife and you decided on the name for your daughter over a WhatsApp chat while you were both working in different cities. So, personally, what is the significance of this role? Will Cathcart: As I mentioned, it's an honour and humbling to be able to work on this. It’s so inspiring for me to work on something which people use over and over again. You know, going through the market and getting to talk to a bunch of business owners and have them say, “You know, I use WhatsApp”, and then have them show you all the conversation threads they have with people. For me, that's the most invigorating thing in the world. So that's why I was so honoured to get to work on WhatsApp specifically. When Mark asked me, I was like, “Oh my gosh, this is such an opportunity to work on something that people love”. I can hope to add things to it that make it better. Shradha Sharma: It is a very powerful place to be in. Anything stressful in your role? Will Cathcart: I want to make sure we're doing a good job. People rely on this, it's such a huge part of their life. And I want to make sure we do a good job. And then, you know, a lot of our work goes into just the reliability of the service. When we ship new things, there is stress around whether they really meet the expectations of the people. So I think if there's, you know, one thing to stress about it's that or making our product better, reliable, and relevant for people. Shradha Sharma: What would you say is ‘success’ for you? Will Cathcart: I mean, if I take India as an example, I would love to be able to look back a few years from now and see how many more hundreds of millions of people have come online and accessed a bunch of digital services, including communication through WhatsApp. Also, how many more services or capabilities have we added to the platform that have helped make people's lives better. Whether it is people communicating with their friends and family or small businesses driving more economic opportunity.  Shradha Sharma: What's the culture like in WhatsApp when it comes to different markets that you operate in? What's the model like? Do you listen to your local people or is it like, hey, here’s a strategy that has been decided in California. How does that dynamic work? Will Cathcart: It's really about going around the world and listening to how people use WhatsApp. I think if we were to only listen to how people use it in California, it would be a mistake. I think people in California use it very differently. And, actually not as much like in India or a bunch of other countries. For example, WhatsApp has spent much more time and energy on making the product work really well on very inexpensive phones and very spotty network connections than most apps. And that came from hearing that it was a global need that may not have been as acute in California. Because the team has built such a culture of listening to what people around the world need, it has led them to build a product that's been, I think, much more successful. And so, we're really hoping to continue that. It's one of the reasons why we're actually taking these trips and hiring as many people as possible. Shradha Sharma: Is this your first trip to India? Will Cathcart: It's my second trip. I came once a long time ago. It's amazing. I mean, it's so vibrant and there's so much going on. The energy of all these entrepreneurs who are just going and building these businesses, starting with something very, very small, but finding a way to build something that's adding value to their customers. That's really exciting to see. And usually you just don't see anything like that, you know? It's not been exhausting. I mean, it’s a long flight, but otherwise, it's been great.",https://yourstory.com/2019/07/whatsapp-global-head-will-cathcart-payments-india-business?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

143,Will continue to admire you: Bumrah on Malinga,"Praising his Mumbai Indians teammate and Sri Lankan international pacer Lasith Malinga, Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah wrote, ""[T]hank you for everything you've done for cricket. Always admired you and will always continue to do so"". Bumrah also praised Malinga's figures of 3/38 in his final ODI match, terming it as a 'Classic Mali spell'.",Times Now,"On Friday (July 26), Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga retired from the ODI format following his side's 91-run win over Bangladesh in the series opener of the three-match series at R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. Malinga had earlier announced his retirement from the format and will now take part only in the shortest format, with an eye on next year's ICC World Twenty20 (WT20) in Australia.Malinga had a perfect end to his glittering ODI career. Not only did the pacer come out to bat and remained unbeaten on a run-a-ball 6, but he also finished with 3 for 38 in 9.4 overs and ended the proceedings with a slower ball to get Mustafizur Rahman's scalp. Before that, he had triggered Bangladesh's collapse in pursuit of 315 by removing the openers -- Tamim Iqbal and Soumya Sarkar.As a result, Malinga finished with 338 wickets in 226 ODIs. He, thus, concluded his 50-over career as the ninth highest wicket-taker in the format at an average of 28.87 and strike-rate of 32.3. Known as the yorker king, Malinga not only laid the foundation of many Sri Lankan victories but also mentored India's current pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.Being together in the Mumbai Indians' (MI) dugout, Bumrah learned the tricks of the trade -- for instance, the slower bouncers, yorkers and low full-tosses -- from his mentor, and has successfully replicated the same in international cricket for Virat Kohli-led side across formats. Hence, Bumrah owes a lot to Malinga and paid tribute to the 35-year-old Sri Lankan speedster after his ODI retirement on Friday.Bumrah wrote on his official Twitter handle:Classic Mali spell Thank you for everything you've done for cricket. Always admired you and will always continue to do so .Bumrah and Malinga were a part of the MI squad which won the IPL championship for the fourth time under Rohit Sharma. The duo played an essential part in taking the franchise to the final wherein they led the charge in the death overs to handover a famous 1-run win to their side over arch-rivals Chennai Super Kings (CSK).Talking about Malinga, he will continue to play the T20I format and aim to take Sri Lankan cricket forward after the side's disappointing 2019 World Cup. The speedster, who played his fourth World Cup, managed to shine and returned with 13 scalps -- most by a Sri Lankan in the edition. On the other hand, Bumrah will travel to the Caribbean island for the two-match Test series against West Indies from next month.

US President Donald Trump had issued economic threats against Mexico and Central America if more is not done to curb migration. Most people caught trying to enter the US illegally come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.",Reuters,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s government said on Saturday it would help Honduras create 20,000 jobs this year and support its coffee farmers as the two countries seek to curb migration to the United States that has created tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his Honduran counterpart, Juan Orlando Hernandez, pledged to work together to lift prosperity in Central America, where poverty and violence have fueled an exodus of people north. That migration has angered Trump, who has made border security a priority, and issued economic threats against Mexico and Central America if more is not done to contain the flows. Speaking after the Honduran and Mexican leaders met in the eastern state of Veracruz, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Lopez Obrador had given instructions to help Honduras create 20,000 jobs between now and December. He did not provide further details, but afterwards the two presidents offered more insights into their plans in speeches in the eastern city of Minatitlan. Hernandez said he was hoping a “great international coalition for mass job creation” in Central America could be forged, while Lopez Obrador stressed that Mexico would support the region with funds and employment schemes. In particular, Lopez Obrador said, Mexico would assist Honduran coffee farmers, whose businesses have suffered this year from a drop in international prices. “We’ll help improve coffee production in whatever is needed,” he said, “so you have no problem selling coffee.” Lopez Obrador did not offer more details, but also said schemes he has championed in Mexico to create jobs via youth apprenticeships and tree planting would come to Honduras too. There has been a surge this year in migrant apprehensions on the U.S. southern border with Mexico.

152,Taliban rejects direct talks with Afghan government,"The Taliban militant group on Sunday said it will not hold direct talks with Afghan government. ""Intra-Afghan talks will start only after a foreign force withdrawal is announced,"" said Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban's political office in Qatar. This comes after a Afghan minister said that talks with the Taliban will be held ""in the coming two weeks"".",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban said on Sunday they will not hold direct talks with the Afghan government and rejected a statement from a senior minister about plans to hold such a meeting in the next two weeks, a senior Taliban official said. State Minister for Peace Affairs Abdul Salam Rahimi said on Saturday it was hoped that direct talks with the Taliban would be held in the next two weeks in an unidentified European country. The government would be represented by a 15-member delegation, he said. But Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, denied that, saying talks with the Afghan government would only come after a deal had been struck with the United States on the departure of its forces. “Intra-Afghan talks will start only after a foreign force withdrawal is announced,” Shaheen said. The U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said after Rahimi had made his announcement that talks between the Taliban and Afghans would happen after the United States “concludes its own agreement” with the Taliban. Khalilzad has held several rounds of direct talks with Taliban officials in Qatar since late last year with the focus on a Taliban demand for the withdrawal of U.S. and other foreign forces and a U.S. demand the Taliban guarantee that Afghanistan will not be used as a base for terrorism. Two other main issues in the peace process are a ceasefire and talks between the rival Afghan sides, or inter-Afghan talks, as they are known. But the Taliban have refused to talk to the government of President Ashraf Ghani, denouncing it as a U.S. puppet, and fighting has seen no let-up. That has led to some concern in Afghanistan that the United States might strike a deal to allow the United States to pull out of an 18-year war that President Donald Trump is impatient to end, leaving the Afghan government to battle on alone. Khalilzad has been in Kabul discussing the peace process with Ghani, opposition leaders, diplomats and civil society members before heading to Qatar for the next round of talks with the Taliban. Two sources privy to the Qatar talks said the United States and the Taliban were expected to sign a memorandum of understanding this week to firm up a plan for the withdrawal of foreign troops and for a Taliban pledge to stop militants plotting from Afghan soil. About 20,000 foreign troops, most of them American, are in Afghanistan as part of a U.S.-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces. Some U.S. forces carry out counter-terrorism operations. Khalilzad said on Twitter that after the U.S. concludes its agreements, intra-Afghan negotiations would take place between the Taliban and “an inclusive and effective national negotiating team consisting of senior government officials, key political party representatives, civil society and women”. A senior member of the Taliban in Afghanistan said Ghani wanted to hold direct talks with the Taliban to legitimise his political credentials before a Sept. 28 presidential election in which he hopes to win a second term. But it was up to the United States to commit to pulling out its troops to end the bloodshed, said the Taliban leader, who declined to be identified. “Pressure tactics either from the U.S. or from the Afghan government will only increase violence,” he said. On Sunday, Taliban fighters destroyed police checkpoints and killed at least seven policemen and civilians in an attempt to seize control of a district in the central province of Ghazni, south of Kabul, a provincial official said. Government forces launched air strikes on Taliban positions in Ghazni on Saturday, killing at least nine insurgents, the Ministry of Defence said.

""I'm not doing any review,"" she said. Earlier, reports claimed the PMO asked for the plan to be restudied for risks and Centre may instead issue rupee-denominated offshore bonds.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has ruled out reconsidering a plan to issue foreign currency overseas sovereign bonds, she was quoted as saying in an interview published on Sunday, despite warnings of long-term risk for the economy.  On Thursday, Reuters reported that the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) wanted the finance ministry to reassess the idea of issuing foreign currency overseas sovereign bonds and seek wider consultation. “I am not doing any review. I have not been asked by anybody to do a review,” Sitharaman told the Economic Times. This month, Sitharaman, presenting the budget for the fiscal year 2019/2020 that began on April 1, said India would look to issue overseas foreign currency sovereign bonds in addition to raising funds from the domestic market.     The proposal has been criticised by former heads of the Reserve Bank of India, economists and allies of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, who argue it could create long-term economic risks by exposing the government’s liabilities to currency fluctuations. “The government would start raising a part of its gross borrowing programme in external markets in external currencies. This will also have a beneficial impact on the demand situation for government securities in domestic market,” Sitharaman told the Economic Times. The government plans to borrow nearly $10 billion from the foreign overseas market, out of total planned borrowing of about $103 billion in 2019/20. Sitharaman told the newspaper that details such as timing of the issue and the exact size had not been worked out.

Sobers had played his first colonial game with 11 fingers, after one of the spare fingers was removed before he was nine. The other spare finger was removed with a sharp knife when he was 14.",Cricket Country,"There is a belief in certain parts of India, and even outside of India, that someone born with six fingers is very fortunate. There is no scientific basis to this belief as there have been people of humble background with a sixth finger in one or both hands.One famous name in the world of cricket to be born with six fingers on each hand is Garry Sobers, the man widely acknowledged as the greatest all-round cricketer. In the book, “Garry Sobers: My autobiography”, Sobers writes: “There are those who claim I was destined to do well in life because I arrived in this world with two extra fingers, as though there was something mystic about it. I wasn’t bothered. They didn’t inhibit me in any way and I never bothered about them. The condition is rare, but there are people in the Caribbean who have this unusual feature. In fact I met a West Indian quite recently who had an extra finger on each hand, just as I did.“I didn’t know how it came about and I was neither embarrassed nor excited by it, but the other kids would say that I was so good at cricket because I had six fingers on each hand. Certainly I didn’t think there was anything mystic about it, although some of the crueler boys call me a freak.“The first extra finger fell off quite early, when I was nine or ten, and I played my first colonial game with 11 fingers! I took the second off when I was 14 or 15 and playing serious cricket. The first of the spare fingers came off with the help of a piece of cat gut wrapped around the base and a sharp tug, something like the old-fashioned way of removing a child’s milk tooth. The other came off with the help of a sharp knife.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/criclife/garry-sobersthe-man-who-was-born-with-six-fingers-in-each-hands-499961?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Meanwhile, Shane Warne said, ""Very surprised/disappointed that Carey didn't make the Aussie squad.""",CricTracker,"Alex Carey was one of the star performers for Australia in the recently concluded World Cup. The southpaw batted with guts in the middle-order and churned out some knocks of substance, batting under tremendous pressure. He was one of the players, who was expected to make the cut for the upcoming Ashes in England, but unfortunately, he missed the bus for the high-voltage series.Matthew Wade, who hasn’t played a Test for almost a couple of years, was selected as a backup wicketkeeper for Tim Paine, also the Australian Test skipper. Wade has been outstanding though in recent times. Quite expectantly, the decision to leave out Carey has shocked a few Aussie greats.AdvertisementMark Waugh, the former Aussie cricketer, was taken aback by the move, especially after how Carey delivered in the 2019 World Cup. “Got to be kidding Alex Carey.

He further said that he build the party by 'janseva' adding that the fight for the common man will continue.Kumaraswamy’s statement comes after senior party leader GT Devegowda said that some MLAs had suggested that the party should sit in opposition, while some legislators opined that the party should give outside support to the BJP.Earlier, former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda made the party position clear by ruling out any support to the BJP government headed by BS Yediyurappa, saying his party would play the role of a ""constructive"" opposition.The BJP government headed by Yediyurappa took charge of the office on Friday after the collapse of the Congress-JDS coalition ministry with the defeat of the motion of confidence in the assembly on Tuesday.The JD(S) patriarch also said that if Yediyurappa government does something good for the state then it will be welcomed.Speaking on horse-trading, Deve Gowda had earlier said that in his entire political career he had never witnessed something like this slamming the BJP for bringing down the coalition government.  The grand old party accused the Centre, the BJP's central leadership, Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala and the Maharashtra government of playing a major role in the downfall of the coalition government.Reacting to Deve Gowda's statement, BJP working President JP Nadda took a dig at Congress-JD(S) coalition in Karnataka saying that the government fell under its own weight.Meanwhile, just a day after coming to power in Karnataka, party sources said that the saffron party was mulling bringing a no-confidence motion against Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar if he does not voluntarily vacate the post.The post of the speaker is conventionally held by a member from the ruling party and BJP’s message has been conveyed to Kumar discreetly.Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa will be moving the confidence motion in the assembly on Monday to prove his majority.Yediyurappa staked claim to form the government after the late-night phone call with Home Minister Amit Shah barely 24 hours after the Speaker disqualified three rebel MLAs.The Congress-JD(S) government was brought down by rebel MLAs which led the BJP to stake claim to form the government in the state ending the high-voltage drama.  ",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/news-about-joining-hands-with-bjp-baseless-hd-kumaraswamy-says-will-build-party-by-janseva/460043?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
166,Chemist who co-invented JUUL launches own e-cigarettes in China,"Xing Chenyue, the chemist who had co-invented JUUL e-cigarettes and developed nicotine salts e-liquid formulation for JUUL pods, has launched her own e-cigarette product in China. ""JUUL's technology is now three years old. I don't think it's made any other innovation on the liquid formulation since they launched,"" Xing said. She had co-founded the startup Myst Labs in 2017.",TechCrunch,"The chemist who helped create the magic sauce behind Juul, Xing Chenyue, unveiled the product of her new startup Myst Labs this week after two years of development: electronic cigarette alternatives designed for China’s 350 million smokers, the world’s biggest smoking population.This new contender makes for a potentially heated battlefield given that Juul will reportedly enter China soon. TechCrunch has reached out to Juul about its expansion, but has not heard back at the time of writing.Pax Labs — the company that spun out Juul in 2017 — was a 20-person team when Xing joined as one of its first scientists in 2013. During her nearly three-year post at what would become America’s largest vaping company, Xing helped invent nicotine salts, the compounds that made Juul an instant hit. The patented technology inspired a raft of followers because it allows high levels of nicotine to be inhaled more easily and with less irritation, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Xing left Juul when the company made a foray into marijuana vaporizers, a move that didn’t particularly interest the scientist, a non-smoker whose ambition is to “help smokers meet their nicotine needs whilst reducing the harmful substances they consume,” Xing told TechCrunch in a phone interview.Myst says it spends about 20% of its money raised on research and development. / Photo: Myst LabsMyst says it spends about 20% of its money raised on research and development. / Photo: Myst LabsThe China-born scientist took up a project management role at publicly-traded pharmaceutical company Dermia before eventually returning to cigarettes research by starting Myst Labs, which she co-founded in 2017 with Thomas Yao, a venture capitalist she had met over a decade ago at Fudan University in Shanghai.As Myst began to take form, Juul was on course to reach its whopping $38 billion valuation even while it was under fire for luring teenagers into vaping. Meanwhile in China, vaping had just begun to catch on. Research from Soochow Securities (in Chinese) shows that China, despite being the world’s biggest producer of vaping devices, accounts for merely 6% of the world’s e-cig market. Xing wanted to seize the opportunity and this time, she’s in control over what comes out of the lab.“We certainly want to reach the same level of society-wide impact in China as Juul does in the U.S. We hope Myst can leave a positive mark on Chinese smokers,” said Xing. “Myst can slowly transform the way people smoke and gradually reduce the level of their nicotine intake.”Myst’s first product, dubbed the P1 series, is a 399 yuan ($58) flash-drive-shaped device that comes with a nicotine level of 3% or 5% and sports a retractable cigarette holder for hygiene and a “click” sound that mimics a lighter. Myst will ship in China through online and offline channels and said it plans to sell in international markets down the road. Its price point is comparable to Juul’s pricing in the U.S.Myst does not market itself as a smoking cessation tool because to do so would require approval from China’s drug regulator. Rather, the startup bills itself as a “new type of cigarette substitute for adult smokers.” It has avoided using images of young, cool-looking models, the style of campaigns that backfired on Juul. To verify customers’ age, Myst applies facial recognition, an increasingly ubiquitous technology in China where people scan their face to pay for things or access certain entertainment services such as video games and live videos.Myst says its products are priced and marketed to target ‘adult smokers,’ not young people. / Photo: Myst LabsMyst says its products are priced and marketed to target ‘adult smokers,’ not young people. / Photo: Myst LabsThat positioning also allows the company to potentially evade stepping on the toes of China’s powerful cigarette monopoly, which provides the government with handsome sums of tax revenues.Myst deploys about half of its 20-person team to conduct research and development in Silicon Valley. The rest of the company mainly works out of Shenzhen, the electronics manufacturing hub that also produces the majority of the world’s vaporizers.“We are combining Silicon Valley research and China’s supply chain, a strategy that sets us apart from most vaporizers on the market,” Yao, who heads up business development at Myst, told TechCrunch.He compared China’s vaping craze to what happened to smartphones between 2010 and 2011 when copycats of incumbents crowded the market in a gold rush. Countless knockoffs of Juul and other established brands now flood the market. Companies with various degrees of development capabilities have also mushroomed — at least 20 Chinese e-cig startups have received venture investment in the last seven months.As with the smartphone market that’s now dominated by a small rank of players, Yao believed the bad apples in vaping will eventually be weeded out. “This [counterfaiting] happens whenever China experiences a technological breakthrough. Chinese brands get eliminated at a rate to which no other country can compare. Perhaps a lot of [e-cig] companies will go out of business by the end of this year.” A sector reshuffle will result in part from government regulation, which can arrive in China anytime soon.Myst co-founder Thomas Yao introduced his co-founder and the company’s chief scientist Xing Chenyue, a former scientist at Juul. / Photo: Myst LabsMyst co-founder Thomas Yao introduced his co-founder and the company’s chief scientist Xing Chenyue, a former scientist at Juul. / Photo: Myst LabsXing believes Myst’s edge lies in the quality of its products. According to Yao, the company spends about 20% of the money raised on R&D.Yao declined to disclose how much the company has banked but said it has sufficient funds in the coffer and that “money isn’t an issue” because he has personally invested in Myst. Yao had previously picked some winners by backing mobility unicorn Lime and India’s wallet leader Paytm in their early days.The co-founder has also brought to the table key personnel for the business, including Myst’s chief executive officer Daniel Chen, who previously managed Hong Kong-listed robotics firm Super Robotics; chief operation officer Martin Liu, former CEO of Blackberry China; head of product Yingqun Cao, a former product manager at Google Home and Juul; and lastly head of design Jiandong Hao, previously a design director at global design firm IDEO.The pool of talent is reflective of Myst’s vision to digitize smoking, which can manifest in the form of a connected vaporizer that tracks users’ health conditions just like a smart wristband does. Myst’s current generation of products does not yet enable the futuristic scenario, but Yao maintained that digitization is key to smoking.“For smokers, vaporizers could become the second most used electronic devices after smartphones,” he said.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/27/myst-labs-profile/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Moreover, Dharmasena himself commented on the matter and also clarified that he discussed with all the umpires involved in the game before awarding six runs to England.However, even he admitted that it was an error in judgement from him in the middle and also went on to say that he doesn’t regret the decision. The two batsmen hadn’t crossed each other while taking the second run when the throw came and the hosts should’ve been given only five runs. But New Zealand were hard done with the decision and the match eventually was tied.

196,India's Venezuelan June oil imports highest in 21 months: Reuters,"India's oil imports from Venezuela surged to about 475,200 barrels per day (bpd) in June, the highest in 21 months, according to Reuters data. Private refiners Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy, part-owned by Russia's Rosneft, are the only Indian buyers of Venezuelan oil. These companies had a term deal to buy oil from Venezuela, which predated US sanctions in January.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s oil imports from Venezuela surged to about 475,200 barrels per day (bpd) in June, more than double the previous month and highest in 21 months, data from shipping and industry sources showed. Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA in January to put pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro. These sanctions have driven away many customers of Venezuelan oil, leaving supplies for some refiners. Private refiners Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy, part owned by Russian oil major Rosneft, are the only Indian buyers of Venezuelan oil. These companies had a term deal to buy oil from PDVSA, which predated the sanctions. Apart from PDVSA, Indian refiners also buy crude from Rosneft that receive oil in return for a reduction in Venezuela’s debt. Russia has loaned Venezuela almost $16 billion since 2006, which is being repaid in oil shipments.     In June, Nayara Energy received about 940,000 tonnes of Venezuelan oil, mostly from Rosneft. But most of those cargoes were discharged in July, the data from shipping and industry sources showed. Nayara did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.     Reliance, which had signed a 15-year deal with PDVSA in 2012 to purchase up to 400,000 bpd of heavy crude, received about 1 million tonnes of oil from the Venezuela in June.     India’s Venezuelan imports surged in June as most of the cargoes were delayed parcels from previous months, shipping sources said.     India’s imports of Venezuelan oil in June were about 54% higher than the year ago, the data showed.     In the first half of 2019, India’s imports of Venezuelan oil rose 11% to about 357,000 bpd, the data showed.     Rising imports from Venezuela in January-June 2019 also partly helped to compensate for the loss of Iranian oil. India stopped buying Iranian oil from May because of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Since November last year, only state refiners in India had made purchases from Iran between November and May, when waivers for buyers of Iranian oil ended. Reliance and Nayara halted purchases of oil from Tehran from the fourth quarter of 2018 as payment channels were affected by the U.S. sanctions.     India’s overall oil imports in June fell about 7.6% percent from a year ago to 4.47 million bpd as some refinery units were shut units for maintenance, the shipping and industry data sources showed.

Agarwal's Volcan Investments had borrowed the amount to fund the acquisition. After accounting for interest payments and investment banking fees, Volcan's profit would have been $243-265 million.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Mining mogul Anil Agarwal pocketed just 6% profit from his 3.5 billion pound ($4.3 billion) investment in Anglo American (AAL.L), held since 2017, even though the underlying shares rose over 50% since then, according to Reuters estimates.  Agarwal’s family vehicle Volcan Investments, the biggest shareholder in Anglo, said on Thursday it would unwind its almost-20% stake in the South African miner by repaying debt with 247.1 million Anglo shares. After paying back the loan, Volcan would have been left with a 1.9% stake that was sold in the open market for 519 million pounds on Thursday. This makes up his gross profit from the whole investment, according to a source familiar with the deal.  Once coupon payments and the investment banking fees are accounted for, the sum dwindles to 196.25 million-213.7 million pounds, or 5.7%-6.1% of the original deal size, a Reuters calculation shows.          Under the terms of the original deal, Volcan borrowed 3.5 billion pounds through the issuance of a mandatory convertible bond arranged by U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) to fund the acquisition.      The convoluted structure, dubbed “POEMS” (Purchaser of Equity via Mandatory Securities) by JPMorgan, is a variation of the more traditional “exchangeable bond” format, where a borrower issues debt that can be converted into shares of another company. Volcan Investments and JPMorgan declined to comment.  The first bond would have matured in April 2020, if the Indian billionaire had not cashed out, dashing speculation that he was preparing to take over the 30.8 billion pound diversified miner. The nature of the convertible bond issuance, however, meant that Agarwal’s profit was just a fraction of the London-listed miner’s massive increase in value of an average 7 pounds per share over the past two years. Agarwal’s gross profit is the 24.7 million shares, or about 1.9% of Anglo, he was left with after repaying the bond. JP Morgan arranged a sale of those shares for 519 million pounds on Thursday. On top of that, there is the 4% coupon paid on the debt, which comes at about 280 million pounds over a two-year period, and the fees paid to JPMorgan.   M&A consultancy Freeman Consulting Services said convertible bonds issued by Anglo American typically garner fees of around 0.75%-1.25% of the transaction size.  Assuming JPMorgan charged Volcan a similar fee for this convoluted structure, the total cost to Agarwal is 26.25 million to 43.75 million pounds.

We are still talking to the coaches.”There was no word on the future of fielding coach Ryan Cook, but it seems unlikely for him to continue. “After what happened yesterday, we have to ask the fielding coach what’s wrong,” Hassan said. “After that we will decide if we need a new fielding coach.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/charl-langeveldt-daniel-vettori-assigned-bangladesh-bowling-coach-roles-872767?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

213,Record heatwave in Europe could melt Greenland's ice sheet: WMO,"The record heatwave that swept across much of western Europe is set to move towards Greenland and could cause record melting, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said. Greenland lost 160 billion tonnes of ice through surface melting in July, the WMO said, citing data from Denmark's Polar Portal. Increasingly intense heatwaves are linked to manmade climate change, the WMO added.",Reuters,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The hot air that smashed European weather records this week looks set to move towards Greenland and could cause record melting of the world’s second largest ice sheet, the United Nations said on Friday. Clare Nullis, spokeswoman for the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, said the hot air moving up from North Africa had not merely broken European temperature records on Thursday but surpassed them by 2, 3 or 4 degrees Celsius, which she described as “absolutely incredible”. “According to forecasts, and this is of concern, the atmospheric flow is now going to transport that heat towards Greenland,” she told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva. “This will result in high temperatures and consequently enhanced melting of the Greenland ice sheet,” she said. “We don’t know yet whether it will beat the 2012 level, but it’s close.” Nullis cited data from Denmark’s Polar Portal, which measures the daily gains and losses in surface mass of the Greenland Ice Sheet. “In July alone, it lost 160 billion tonnes of ice through surface melting. That’s roughly the equivalent of 64 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. Just in July. Just surface melt - it’s not including ocean melt as well.” The Greenland Ice Sheet covers 80% of the island and has developed over many thousands of years, with layers of snow compressed into ice.  The dome of ice rises to a height of 3,000 meters and the total volume of the ice sheet is approximately 2,900,000 cubic kilometres, which would raise global sea levels by 7 metres if it melted entirely, according to the Polar Portal website.  Greenland had not had exceptional weather this year until June, but its ice had been melting rapidly in recent weeks, she said.  The warmer air also had implications for Arctic ice extent, which was nearly the lowest on record as of July 15, Nullis said. She said increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves were linked to manmade climate change.  “What we saw with this one was that temperature records weren’t just broken, they were smashed.” She cited a study by the Britain’s Met Office which found that by 2050, record-breaking heatwaves would happen every other year.

221,Trump says US could tax French wine in retaliation for digital tax,"US President Donald Trump has threatened to tax French wines in retaliation for France's recent proposal to levy a tax aimed at large US technology companies. ""I've always said American wine is better than French wine!"" Trump tweeted. France urged the US not to bring trade tariffs into the debate on ""fair taxation of digital activities"".",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to tax French wines on Friday in retaliation for France’s recent proposal to levy a tax aimed at big U.S. technology companies. Trump had told French President Emmanuel Macron last week that he was concerned about the proposed digital services tax. “If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron’s foolishness shortly,” Trump tweeted on Friday. “I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine!” Later in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters the tax decision was wrong and he threatened the key French export. “They shouldn’t have done this,” Trump said. “I told them, I said, ‘Don’t do it because if you do it, I’m going to tax your wine.’” He said a few minutes later that the U.S. response would be announced soon, saying that it “might be on wine, it might be on something else.” Trump and Macron spoke by telephone on Friday and discussed the tax and next month’s summit of the Group of 7 rich nations in France, the White House said. Macron’s office said the French leader “underlined that the G7 summit would be an important opportunity to move towards a universal taxation of digital activities, which is in our common interest, and which we need to keep working on in order to obtain a broad international agreement.” The United States is by far the largest single export market for French wine and spirits, which is France’s second-biggest export after aerospace. The United States in 2018 accounted for nearly a quarter of all French wine exports, or 3.2 billion euros’ ($3.6 billion) worth. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a statement after Trump’s tweet that “the universal taxation of digital activities is a challenge that concerns all of us. We want to reach a deal on this within the framework of the G7 and the OECD. In the meantime, France will move ahead with national decisions.” White House spokesman Judd Deere said the United States “is extremely disappointed by France’s decision to adopt a digital services tax at the expense of U.S. companies and workers.  France’s unilateral measure appears to target innovative U.S. technology firms that provide services in distinct sectors of the economy.” He added, “The administration is looking closely at all other policy tools.”  Two weeks ago, the French Senate approved the 3% levy that will apply to revenue from digital services earned in France by companies with more than 25 million euros in French revenue and 750 million euros ($834 million) worldwide.  Other EU countries, including Austria, Britain, Spain and Italy, have also announced plans for their own digital taxes. They say a levy is needed because big, multinational internet companies such as Facebook and Amazon are able to book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland, no matter where the revenue originates.  Earlier this month, the United States threatened tariffs on an additional $4 billion worth of European Union goods, including wine, cheese and whiskey - that could be hit with tariffs as part of a nearly 15-year-long dispute at the World Trade Organization over aircraft subsidies given to U.S. planemaker Boeing Co and its European rival, Airbus SE. The EU’s director general for trade, Sabine Weyand, this week said she expected the Trump administration to proceed to implement some of the tariffs after a WTO arbitrator ruled on the damage caused to Boeing as a result of illegal EU government aid to Airbus. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said France’s new digital services tax “targets U.S. firms almost exclusively and largely spares French companies.” The U.S. Trade Representative’s Office (USTR) last month said it would hold a hearing on Aug. 19 in its probe of the planned tax, which could lead to the United States imposing new tariffs or other trade restrictions. USTR could issue new tariffs on French goods after the public comment period closes on Aug. 26. USTR said the levy was an “unreasonable tax policy.” The plan departs from tax norms because of “extraterritoriality; taxing revenue not income; and a purpose of penalizing particular technology companies for their commercial success,” it said. The tax is due to apply retroactively from the start of 2019, which USTR said calls into question its fairness.

227,BJP targeting to become 20-crore-member party: JP Nadda,"BJP Working President JP Nadda on Saturday said his party has enrolled over 11 crore members through its membership drive and it is now targeting to become a 20-crore-member organisation. ""We are not competing against anyone, we are trying to break our own record,"" he added. ""Even all the other political parties say...they can't match the saffron party,"" claimed Nadda.",The Financial Express,"BJP working president J P Nadda said on Saturday the party has enrolled more than 11 crore members through its membership drive and it is now targeting to become a 20-crore-member organisation. Nadda also lashed out at other political parties, alleging they “lacked” the will to serve the nation and were only “hankering after” chairs. The former Union health minister said the work done by the Modi government in the past 50 days would prove to be a milestone in making India a USD 5-trillion economy.“Today, we are the world’s biggest party. We are not competing against anyone, we are trying to break our own record. Under the membership drive, we have enrolled more than 11 crore members and now we have kept a target of 20 crore. “There is no competition. Even all the other political parties say they are behind the BJP and they cannot match the saffron party,” Nadda said, addressing party workers here. His Haryana visit assumes significance as the state is likely to go to polls in October this year. During his two-day visit, Nadda will meet senior BJP leaders and discuss the preparations ahead of the assembly polls.Criticising political opponents, Nadda said they are into politics for their “vested interests”. “There are 1,300 political parties in the country and in these outfits, somebody’s son is doing politics, somebody is into politics because they belong to some particular caste and dynasty. The BJP is the only party, where an ordinary man can reach the top position in politics,” he said. Citing the examples of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, he said they came from ordinary families and rose to the top positions in politics.“Ours is the only political party which has got democratic values,” he said. “BJP is the only party which has everything including leader, policy, intention, worker etc. You ask any political party about its policy, they will not be able to utter two words on it. They just only want chairs. They lack will to serve nation,” he said.Nadda further said, “When we say Congress-free nation, it does not mean only Congress party. We mean corruption-free, commission-free India.” Listing out the Modi government’s achievements in the past 50 days, he said the government’s work focused on the weaker section of the society and strengthening of economy.“Do you know that the work done in past 50 days by Modi government would be a milestone in making India a USD 5-trillion economy,” he said in his address to party workers. He talked about the target of building 1.95 crore houses for the poor and drinking water supply for rural households and amendment to labour laws. Nadda lauded the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government in Haryana, saying it provided a corruption-free dispensation and brought transparency in government jobs.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

Two South Koreans, a 38-year-old and a 27-year-old, were taken to hospital where they succumbed to injuries. Over 15 people including eight international swimmers, suffered injuries.",Reuters,"GWANGJU, South Korea (Reuters) - The upper deck of a nightclub collapsed on top of revelers in South Korea on Saturday, killing two people and injuring several foreign athletes competing at the World Aquatics Championships, rescue officials and witnesses said. The floor gave way in the Coyote Ugly nightclub in the city of Gwangju at about 2:30 a.m. (1730 GMT Friday), pinning people underneath and injuring at least 10, rescue officials said. The two people killed were South Korean. New Zealand men’s water polo team captain Matt Small said he was on the second-floor deck when it collapsed. “We were just dancing and then the next minute we dropped,” he told New Zealand’s Radio Sport. “We ... fell on top of the heads of other people that were beneath us ... Some of them were pretty dire cases,” he said of the injured. Kim Young-don, chief of the Gwangju Seobu Fire Station, told a briefing there were about 370 people in the club at the time. “We deem that the second level ... seems to have collapsed because there were too many people on it,” he said. “The second level is a small space, it’s not a space where a lot of people can be.” Gwangju, about 330 km (205 miles) south of the capital Seoul, has been hosting the championships, which feature swimming, water polo and diving, over the past fortnight. The meet finishes on Sunday. Organizers said eight foreign athletes were injured, with seven sustaining minor injuries and one remaining in hospital for treatment of a leg laceration.  Three of the injured athletes were from the United States, two from New Zealand and one each from Italy, the Netherlands and Brazil, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported. All but the Brazilian were water polo players, it said. A Gwangju police officer told Reuters two co-owners and two workers at the nightclub were being questioned about possible illegal expansion and renovation at the nightclub, and the legality of its licensing. Australian, New Zealand and U.S. water polo officials confirmed team members were present when the incident occurred. The women’s water polo tournament wrapped up on Friday with the United States beating Spain in the final and Australia beating Hungary in the bronze medal match. Christopher Ramsey, CEO of USA Water Polo (USAWP), said it was an awful tragedy. “Players from our men’s and women’s teams were celebrating the women’s world championship victory when the collapse occurred,” Ramsey said. “Our hearts go out to the victims of the crash and their families.” USAWP said women’s team member Kaleigh Gilchrist suffered a leg laceration and underwent surgery at a Gwangju hospital, while Paige Hauschild and Johnny Hooper needed stitches. Ben Hallock suffered minor scrapes. Water Polo Australia said some of its players were in the club but were not hurt. Women’s team captain Rowie Webster said she was one of those who fell from the second floor. “It was quite scary,” she said. Organizers FINA said it “deeply regrets the situation and sends its best wishes to any victims of this accident”. “FINA is carefully monitoring the situation and will activate all measures to ensure health care and assistance is provided whenever necessary,” it said in a statement.   Public safety has been a hot button issue in South Korea after the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, which killed 304 people, most of them school children. The administration of President Moon Jae-in has made the establishment of a national system for accident prevention and disaster management a priority. But there have been several major incidents since Moon came to power. In December 2017, 29 people were killed and 40 were injured in a fire at a fitness center in Jecheon city. A month later, 45 people died and 147 were injured in a fire in a hospital in Miryang.

245,London Stock Exchange in talks to buy Refinitiv for $27 billion,"The London Stock Exchange Group on Friday said it was in discussions to acquire financial data and trading platform provider Refinitiv Holdings for $27 billion, including debt. LSE said it would pay for the transaction entirely with newly issued shares. A Blackstone Group-led consortium bought a 55% stake in Refinitiv last year from professional information company Thomson Reuters.",Reuters,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE.L) said on Friday it was in discussions to acquire financial data analytics provider Refinitiv Holdings Ltd for $27 billion, including debt.  The deal would come less than a year after buyout firm Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N) acquired a majority stake in Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO), valuing the company at the time at $20 billion including debt. LSE said it would pay for the deal with newly issued LSE shares as currency, turning Refinitiv’s existing investors into LSE shareholders who would own about 37% of the combined company and hold less than 30% of the voting rights. Thomson Reuters, a professional information company that is the parent of Reuters News, currently holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv. It confirmed the negotiations in a statement and said it will own a 15% stake in LSE if the deal is completed. Based on the valuation the deal would assign to Refinitiv, Blackstone will have roughly doubled the value of its original investment in the company, according to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity because the private equity firm keeps that number confidential.  Refinitiv had $12.2 billion in debt as of the end of December as a result of its leveraged buyout by Blackstone, which LSE would assume under the proposed deal. LSE and Thomson Reuters both cautioned that there is no certainty that discussions between the parties will progress or that a transaction will be forthcoming. A person familiar with the matter said on Friday that if the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be agreed next week. Refinitiv did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Blackstone declined to comment. Refinitiv bonds rallied on the prospect of a deal.  Thomson Reuters shares hit a record high to end trading on Friday up 4.5% to C$92.74 in Toronto after the Financial Times first reported on the deal talks. The stock is up 62% since the end of January 2018, when Blackstone and Thomson Reuters announced the deal for Refinitiv.  A merger would significantly expand LSE’s information services business, which the bourse operator has been building as a more stable source of cash flow than its primary transaction-reliant businesses.  “The global exchanges are focusing more and more on data and technology as revenue drivers, and less on the actual matching of buys and sells,” said Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Greenwich Associates. LSE operates equity and derivatives markets that include the London Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana, MTS and Turquoise. It is also the majority owner of LCH, which dominates euro swaps clearing. Its information services business includes financial indexing, benchmarking and analytics services.  The company has a market value of about 19.3 billion pounds ($23.9 billion) and net debt of about 1 billion pounds.  LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) banker of 20 years who has raised expectations of big deals. The LSE has failed several times to merge with rival Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE). Schwimmer was appointed CEO last August after the LSE’s most recent attempt to do a deal with Deutsche Boerse failed.  Buying Refinitiv could help soften the blow for LSE from a bout of market volatility that is expected should Britain leave the European Union by an Oct. 31 deadline without an exit deal. Schwimmer said last month that LSE was “very prepared” for Brexit. The exchange has had to open an EU base in Amsterdam for Turquoise, its London-based pan-European share trading platform. London-based Refinitiv provides financial markets data and infrastructure to more than 40,000 clients in over 190 countries, according to its website.  It caters to traders and investment professionals, who also use LSE’s exchanges. It is the biggest client for news of Reuters News under a 30-year contract signed last year.  Thomson Reuters said in its statement on Friday that this contract will continue if Refinitiv’s ownership changes. Under Blackstone’s majority ownership, Refinitiv has been shedding non-core assets. In April, it launched an initial public offering of Tradeweb Markets Inc (TW.O), an electronic trading platform for bonds and derivative instruments. It has also been in talks with Deutsche Boerse about selling its foreign exchange electronic trading platform FXall. Deutsche Boerse said on Saturday it no longer expected to reach a deal to buy FXall. Private equity firms such as Blackstone aim to buy businesses so they can subsequently sell them at a profit, typically between three and five years later.  A deal with London Stock Exchange for Refinitiv so soon after the carve-out from Thomson Reuters could prove to be a quick, profitable flip for Blackstone, which last week said its assets reached a record $545 billion. Blackstone’s consortium that holds a 55% stake in Refinitiv includes Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd.

Hazare, 82, said his health is not in a good condition but if people of the country take to the streets to safeguard the sanctity of the RTI Act, he would be ready to join them.Hazare, whose movement prompted the then Maharashtra government to enact a revised Maharashtra Right to Information Act which was considered as the base document for the Right to Information Act 2005, was speaking to reporters at his village Ralegan Siddhi in Ahmednagar district.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

257,Guatemala agrees to new migration measures to avoid US sanctions,"In a move aimed at avoiding US sanctions, Guatemala has agreed to implement new measures aimed at reducing US asylum claims from migrants fleeing Honduras and El Salvador. Nearly 200,000 people travelling in families from El Salvador and Honduras have been apprehended at the US border since October, with most passing through Guatemala and Mexico along the way.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he agreed to drop the threat of economic sanctions against Guatemala after the country said it would implement new measures aimed at reducing U.S. asylum claims from migrants fleeing Honduras and El Salvador. The Trump administration has grappled with a surge of mainly Central American migrants claiming asylum at the United States’ southern border with Mexico, an influx that has made it difficult for Trump to restrict immigration as he promised when he was elected. Many of his initiatives have been blocked by court orders, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the group would likely challenge the Guatemala agreement in court. Nearly 200,000 people traveling in families from El Salvador and Honduras have been apprehended at the U.S. border since October, with most passing through Guatemala and Mexico along the way. Mexico agreed last month to deploy troops to try to stanch the flow after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on exports. Trump had pushed for Guatemala to sign a so-called safe third country agreement to require asylum seekers passing through on their way to the United States to first pursue safe haven in Guatemala. When an initial agreement fell through last week, Trump had threatened to impose tariffs, ban travelers and hit remittances with fees. On Friday, he watched as acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan signed an agreement with Guatemala’s minister of government, Enrique Antonio Degenhart, in the Oval Office. “They’re doing what we’ve asked them to do,” Trump told reporters, calling Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales a “terrific guy.” “We have other great countries who are going to be signing on also,” he said, without providing further details. Morales said on Facebook that the agreement had headed off the threat of “drastic sanctions.” Guatemala’s Constitutional Court had ruled that a safe third country deal could not be signed without prior approval from the country’s Congress, which is on a summer recess. The Guatemalan government said in a statement that Friday’s deal - which it did not call a safe third country pact - would allow its citizens to apply for temporary visas to work in the U.S. agricultural sector, and in the medium- to long-term, would allow for work visas for the construction and service sectors. McAleenan said there were still “several procedural steps” required in both countries to ratify the deal and put it into effect, which he said he expected would occur in coming weeks. McAleenan told reporters the pact would protect migrants “at the earliest possible point in their journey,” noting U.S. immigration judges reject asylum claims from most Central American migrants. “If you have a Honduran family or an El Salvadoran national, instead of them having to pay a smuggler, come all the way to our border to seek asylum, when they arrive in Guatemala they’re in a country that has a fair proceeding for assessing asylum claims and that’s where they should make that claim,” he said. Migrants who arrive in the United States who have not first sought asylum in Guatemala will be returned to Guatemala, McAleenan said. One of the poorest countries in the Americas, Guatemala has little experience receiving large numbers of asylum seekers and a large wave of refugees would strain limited resources. Just 262 people applied for refugee status in Guatemala between January and November 2018, according to data from the U.N. rights agency UNHCR. A lawyer for the ACLU said the group would likely challenge in court any move to deny migrants asylum based on an agreement with Guatemala. “Congress made clear that the agreement has to provide a safe, fair and full asylum process,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants Rights Project, who has led several lawsuits blocking Trump’s immigration policies. “But Guatemala can neither offer a safe nor fair and full process and nobody could plausibly argue otherwise,” Gelernt said. Meghan López of the International Rescue Committee in El Salvador said the agreement could leave people in danger. “Guatemala is not safe for Guatemalans, and it is not safe for those who have fled seeking asylum from elsewhere in the Northern Triangle, nor for those who could now be returned to a country not their own,” she said in a statement, referring to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador which have some of the highest murder rates in the world. McAleenan noted the U.S. law that provides for safe third country agreements focuses on process rather than safety. “There are obviously places in Guatemala and in the U.S. that are dangerous. But that does not mean that it doesn’t have an appropriate process, a full and fair process, for asylum seekers to present themselves for protection under international law,” he said. Separately, the Trump administration on Friday instructed U.S. asylum officers to consider whether “internal relocation” within migrants’ home countries was an option. The new guidance said that “private violence is not pervasive across the entirety of each Northern Triangle country,” suggesting that failure to attempt internal relocation could be suitable grounds for rejecting an asylum case.

258,UK PM Johnson's approach to Brexit 'very unhelpful': Ireland,"Ireland deputy PM Simon Coveney has said Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit is ""very unhelpful"" and warned that the new UK PM was not going to get a deal with such an approach. Johnson had on Thursday said the Irish border backstop would have to be struck out of the Brexit agreement if there was to be an orderly exit.",Reuters,"BELFAST (Reuters) - Ireland said on Friday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit was “very unhelpful” and that the new British leader appeared set on a collision course with the European Union that would preclude an orderly exit with a deal. Such biting criticism from Ireland, just two days since Johnson took office with a pledge to strike a new divorce deal with the EU, indicates the perils of the Brexit gambit chosen by Britain’s new government. On entering Downing Street on Wednesday, Johnson cautioned that if the EU refused to negotiate then he would take Britain out on Oct. 31 without a deal, a step that would send shock waves through the world economy. In an indication of business concerns about a disorderly exit from the EU, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said a no-deal Brexit was an existential threat to the British car industry and would risk output. Johnson spiced his pitch to the EU on Thursday by bluntly stating that one of the most hotly contested elements of the Brexit divorce agreement - the Irish border backstop - would have to be struck out if there was to be an orderly exit. Ireland’s second most powerful politician, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, said Johnson’s comments were “very unhelpful” and warned that the new British leader was not going to get a deal with such an approach. “He seems to have made a deliberate decision to set Britain on a collision course with the European Union and with Ireland in relation to the Brexit negotiations,” Coveney told reporters in Belfast after meeting Julian Smith, Britain’s Northern Ireland minister. Smith later said he did not think a collision was looming. “We need to find solutions particularly for the issue of the border, but the prime minister was very, very clear to his cabinet yesterday that he wants to get a deal done,” he said. Further illustrating the delicate issues at stake, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a British EU exit without a deal would raise the question of planning for a possible future unification of Ireland and Northern Ireland. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had a telephone conversation with Johnson on Friday and he has accepted her invitation to visit Berlin. “He said the only solution that would allow us to make progress on a deal is to abolish the backstop,” a spokesman for Johnson said of the call. The stance from Berlin was frank. “My message to the new British prime minister is clear: ‘Boris, the election campaign is over. Calm yourself down. We should be fair with each other’,” Germany’s Europe Minister, Michael Roth, told ZDF television. “What do not help are new provocations. Instead, dialogue - one must be able to expect that from the leader of a friendly nation, one that is still a member of the European Union.” Ireland is crucial to any Brexit solution. Though Ireland is only about an eighth of the size of the United Kingdom’s $2.8 trillion economy, Dublin is backed by the rest of the European Union whose economy - minus the United Kingdom - is worth $15.9 trillion. While Ireland would be very badly affected by a no-deal Brexit, the relative importance of Ireland in the negotiations up-ends almost a thousand years of history in which Dublin has traditionally had a much weaker hand than London. And the 500 km (300 mile) land border between Ireland and Britain’s province of Northern Ireland has always been the biggest stumbling block for an orderly Brexit.  Johnson told the British parliament on Thursday he wanted to abolish the backstop, an insurance policy designed to prevent the return of border controls ended by the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement that former Prime Minister Theresa May struck in November with the EU says the United Kingdom will remain in a customs union “unless and until” alternative arrangements are found to avoid a hard border. But many British lawmakers oppose the prospect of being bound to EU rules and customs duties that would prevent Britain doing its own trade deals and leave it overseen by EU judges. The EU says it will not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement or the backstop protocol within it, but could rework the Political Declaration setting out post-Brexit trade terms that may offer a clearer way of avoiding the backstop. “The approach that the British prime minister seems to now be taking is not going to be the basis of an agreement, and that’s worrying for everybody,” Coveney said.

259,115 feared dead in worst Mediterranean shipwreck of the year,About 115 people are missing and feared to have drowned and another 134 were rescued by Libyan coast guards and local fishermen after a wooden boat carrying migrants capsized off Libya. UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said it was the worst Mediterranean tragedy of this year. Those on board were mainly from Eritrea and other sub-Saharan Africa and Arab countries.,Reuters,"TRIPOLI/GENEVA (Reuters) - About 115 people are missing and feared to have drowned and another 134 were rescued by Libyan coast guards and local fishermen after a wooden boat carrying migrants capsized off Libya, a Libyan navy official said on Thursday. Earlier, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said that up to 150 people were feared dead. “The worst Mediterranean tragedy of this year has just occurred,” UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said in a tweet. There were about 250 people on board, mainly from Eritrea and other sub-Saharan Africa and Arab countries, when the boat capsized off the coast near Komas, east of the capital Tripoli, Libyan navy spokesman Ayoub Qassem said. Libya is a hub for migrants and refugees, many of whom try to reach Europe in unseaworthy boats. The latest shipwreck takes the death toll of Mediterranean migrants to over 600 this year, putting 2019 on track to be the sixth year in a row with more than 1,000 deaths, UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley said.  “Until we address the reasons why people take these dangerous boat journeys, sadly, this is unlikely to be the last tragedy like this that we see,” he said. Yaxley said survivors of the wreck were likely to be brought to two detention centers in Libya where they would face further risks, and he called for their immediate release.  “We know that inside these detention centers there’s insufficient food, water, often unsanitary conditions, there have been widespread reports of human rights violations taking place,” he said. Libya says the migrants are illegally entering and leaving the country. It regularly detains them in centers that the U.N. says are effectively jails, exposing them to the added risk of being caught up in the country’s civil war.   One detention center in Tripoli was hit by an air strike earlier this month, killing more than 50 people. UNHCR subsequently said it had been closed, but rescued migrants have continued to be sent there. Human rights activists have accused politicians in the European Union of turning a blind eye and letting people die rather than risk a voter backlash by appearing soft on immigration. Europe struggled to cope with an influx of more than one million refugees and migrants in 2015. Italy, many African migrants’ intended first destination, has taken a tough line since a populist government took office in 2018, and immediately sought to close the nation’s ports to rescued migrants.

260,Newlywed dies while trying to reach 'Into the Wild' bus in Alaska,A newlywed woman from Belarus died after being swept away in a river while she was trying to hike to an abandoned bus at the edge of Denali National Park in Alaska. The bus was made famous by the book and film 'Into the Wild'. The book and movie are based on the death of a hiker inside the bus.,Reuters," (Corrects second paragraph of this July 26 story to reflect that police now identify deceased as Veranika Nikanava instead of Veramika Maikamava.) By Yereth Rosen ANCHORAGE (Reuters) - A Belarusian woman who was trying to hike to an abandoned bus at the edge of Denali National Park in Alaska made famous in the book and movie “Into the Wild” died after being swept away in a river, state troopers said on Friday. Veranika Nikanava, 24, was pulled underwater when she tried to cross the Teklanika River with her husband Piotr Markielau, also 24, in their journey to the site where hiker Christopher McCandless perished in 1992, the troopers said. There is a rope stretched across the river to help hikers, but waters were waist-high and swift-running when the newly married couple tried to cross on Thursday night, said Ken Marsh, an Alaska State Trooper spokesman.  “Ms. (Nikanava) apparently lost her footing and her grip on the rope,” he said in an email. Hundreds of visitors have ventured over the years into the now-famous Stampede Trail along the edge of the park to try to reach the wrecked vehicle now known as the “Magic Bus.” The abandoned Fairbanks city bus was used as shelter by the 24-year-old McCandless before he died of what the state coroner determined to be starvation. A diary he left describing his final days became material for the book written by Jon Krakauer and the 2007 movie, which stars Emile Hirsch. Several hikers have struggled with the rough Alaska conditions attempting the pilgrimage to the bus. A woman from Switzerland died in 2010, also drowning while trying to cross the Teklanika River. Several others have been rescued. According to the latest available data, there were 15 state search-and-rescue missions into the area from 2009 to 2017, Marsh said.  Nikanava and Markielau had been married less than a month, Marsh said. Her body has been recovered and sent to the state medical examiner’s office, the troopers said.  Reporting by Yereth Rosen in Anchorage; Editing by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles and Sonya Hepinstall",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alaska-death/woman-dies-while-trying-to-reach-into-the-wild-bus-in-alaska-idUSKCN1UM01Q?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Cathcart had announced WhatsApp's payment service will be launched in India this year.",TechCrunch,"WhatsApp  has amassed more than 400 million users in India, the instant messaging app confirmed today, reaffirming its gigantic reach in its biggest market.Amitabh Kant, CEO of highly influential local think-tank NITI Aayog, revealed the new stat at a press conference held by WhatsApp in New Delhi on Thursday. A WhatsApp spokesperson confirmed that the platform indeed had more than 400 million monthly active users in the country.The remarkable revelation comes more than two years after WhatsApp said it had hit 200 million users in India. WhatsApp — or Facebook — did not share any India-specific users count in the period in between.The public disclosure today should help Facebook reaffirm its dominance in India, where it appears to be used by nearly every smartphone user. According to research firm Counterpoint, India has about 450 million smartphone users. (Some other research firms peg the number to be lower.)It’s worth pointing out that WhatsApp also supports KaiOS — a mobile operating system for feature phones. Millions of KaiOS-powered JioPhone handsets have shipped in India. Additionally, there are about 500 million internet users, according to several industry estimates.As WhatsApp becomes ubiquitous in the nation, the service is increasingly mutating to serve additional needs. Businesses such as social-commerce app Meesho have been built on top of WhatsApp. Facebook backed Meesho recently in what was its first investment of this kind in an Indian startup. Then, of course, WhatsApp has also come under hot water for its role in the spread of false information in the nation.As ByteDance  and others aggressively expand their businesses in India, Facebook’s perceived dominance in the country has come under attack in recent months. ByteDance’s TikTok, which has amassed 120 million users in India, has been heralded by many as the top competitor of Facebook.A WhatsApp spokesperson also told TechCrunch that India remains WhatsApp’s biggest market. In 2017, Facebook said its marquee service had about 250 million users in India — a figure it has not updated in the years since.WhatsApp, which has about 1.5 billion monthly active users worldwide, does not really have any major competitor in India. The closest to a competitor it has in the country is Messenger, another platform owned by Facebook, and Hike, which millions of users check everyday. Times Internet — an internet conglomerate in India that runs several news outlets, entertainment services and more — claims to reach 450 million users in the country each month.At the aforementioned press conference, WhatsApp global chief Will Cathcart  said WhatsApp also plans to roll out WhatsApp Pay, its payment service, to all its users toward the end of the year — something TechCrunch reported earlier.Its arrival in India’s burgeoning payments space could create serious tension for Google  Pay, Flipkart’s PhonePe and Paytm. For Facebook, WhatsApp Pay’s success is even more crucial as the company currently has no plans to bring cryptocurrency wallet Calibra to the country, it told TechCrunch on the sidelines of the Libra and Calibra unveil.In a series of announcements this week, WhatsApp also unveiled a tie-up with NITI Aayog to promote women’s entrepreneurship. “By launching ‘gateway to a billion opportunities’ and our digital skills training program, we hope to shine a light on the amazing work already happening and build the next generation of entrepreneurs and change makers,” said Cathcart.At a conference in Mumbai on Wednesday, Cathcart announced a partnership with the Indian School of Public Policy — India’s first program in the theory and practice of public policy, product design and management — to bring a series of privacy design workshops to future policy makers. These workshops will explore “the importance and practice of privacy-centric design to help technology make a positive impact on society,” the Facebook-owned platform said.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/whatsapp-india-users-400-million/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

267,"BigBasket shuts down on-demand delivery in NCR, Mumbai: Report","Bengaluru-based online grocery delivery startup BigBasket has shut down its on-demand, under-90-minute delivery service in areas including the National Capital Region (NCR), Mumbai, Pune and Lucknow, among others, Entrackr reported. The on-demand feature is also not available for premium BBStar members, the report said. However, the on-demand service is reportedly still operational in Bengaluru.",Entrackr,"Concept of on-demand grocery delivery was a rage amongst startups in India during the 2014-17 period. Many players including BigBasket, Grofers, PepperTap, and Localbanya were centered around on-demand grocery. It also helped them raise a large amount of venture capitalist money. But the concept of on-demand grocery is almost dead. Grofers had pivoted from 90 minutes delivery almost two years ago while Localbanya and Peppertap wounded up operations long back. Now, BigBasket also appears to be done with its feature called ‘Express Delivery’.Team members at Entrackr has been trying to order via Express Delivery across Gurugram, Delhi, and Noida (NCR) for over several weeks. However, all these attempts failed. Instead of ‘Express service’ that promises delivery within 90 minutes, the company is showing delivery timing in several slots (next day or sometimes same day).We also have checked the feature in other cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow, and Patna, however, we couldn’t find on-demand feature in these cities as well. The on-demand feature is even not available for premium BBStar members. It’s a premium subscription programme offered by BigBasket. Meanwhile, the service is also available in Bengaluru on a select number of SKUs. Entrackr has sent queries to BigBasket’s co-founder Hari Menon. We will update the post as he responds.Several experts emphasise that on-demand delivery is unviable as the cost per delivery is high. This is the reason why earlier Grofers and now BigBasket is moving from the express delivery feature. Such service costs about Rs 80 per delivery while slot based delivery is relatively cheaper.Since BigBasket has suspended on-demand delivery, it’s likely to have shut down many dark stores which were used to facilitate quick deliveries. Suspension of express delivery has come at a time when BigBasket is betting big on the subscription commerce segment with BBDaily.Like MilkBasket and Dailyninja, subscription-only BBDaily delivers milk and daily essentials every morning.While we don’t know whether BigBasket would also be suspending express delivery feature in Bengaluru or not, the pull out of service from many cities herald the death of on-demand delivery in India. No other player (with substantial scale) except BigBasket used to do on-demand deliveries.The development also brings online grocery segment to a full circle. When grocery e-tailing started in India, many startups jumped to tap into the opportunity with slot based models. However, the shift from the model happened as VCs were showing interest in the on-demand model. Now, with the concerns around profitability and unit economics in express delivery model, these firms have switched back to slot based deliveries.",https://entrackr.com/2019/07/bigbasket-shut-down-on-demand-service/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The court gave the direction while rejecting a petition filed by the second wife of a deceased police personnel seeking pension benefits equivalent to the first wife.,The New Indian Express,"MADURAI: The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Friday directed the Secretary to Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department of the State to initiate disciplinary action against public servants who commit bigamy. Passing the order while rejecting a petition filed by the second wife of a deceased police personnel seeking pension benefits equivalent to the first wife, Justice SM Subramaniam directed the government to issue guidelines to all government departments to enter the name of spouse in the service records of public servants only after verifying the genuineness of the information. “In spite of the Conduct Rules stating that bigamous marriage is misconduct and an offence under the Indian Penal Code, the authorities competent of the various departments are absolutely insensitive towards such issues,” the judge observed. “The consequences of such insensitivity results in denial of livelihood to the other woman, who married the public servant as second wife, without even knowing the consequences,” he added.Hence a foolproof procedure should be adopted by the State for entering name of the nominees in the service records of the public servants, opined the judge and gave the above directions. The petition was filed by one R Thenmozhi seeking direction to provide the deceased husband’s retirement benefits to her and the first wife of her husband proportionately. However, her claim was rejected as her name was not entered as nominee in the service records of her husband.Med aspirant denied admission gets relief
Madurai: The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Friday directed the State government to grant admission to a medical aspirant, whose candidature under SC category was rejected based on ‘nativity rules’, after verifying his community status. Justice R Suresh Kumar passed the order on the petition filed by one P Karuppasamy.The judge noted that the reasons cited by the Selection Committee for refusing admission were due to the fact that his parents were from Sri Lanka and he had studied in Karnataka. The government also questioned the community certificate of the petitioner alleging that the petitioner’s SC community status is in Karnataka but not in Tamil Nadu. However, the judge rejected the contentions of the State. “If one wing of the State conferred a communal and nativity status to a person, another wing of the very same instrumentality of the State cannot reject it without any valid reason,” the judge said. ",http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2019/jul/27/crack-down-on-officials-with-more-than-1-spouse-2009982.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

274,US economy misses Donald Trump's 3% growth target in 2018,"US' Gross Domestic Product expanded by 2.9% last year, missing the 3% growth target set by US President Donald Trump. The economy's performance in 2018 was still an acceleration from the 2.4% growth recorded in 2017. Trump has repeatedly insisted that Federal Reserve should cut borrowing costs, saying it would allow the economy to take off ""like a rocket ship"".",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth in 2018 missed the Trump administration’s 3% target by any measure, which could renew criticism of the White House’s $1.5 trillion in tax cuts.  The Commerce Department said on Friday that gross domestic product increased at a 2.9% rate last year, confirming an estimate which was published in March. The department’s annual revisions to GDP data also showed the economy growing 2.5% in the 12 months through the fourth quarter of 2018, down from the previously reported 3.0%. President Donald Trump had highlighted the year-on-year growth figure as proof that the tax cuts and a government spending blitz, which have helped to swell the federal government deficit, had put the economy on a sustainable path of strong growth. The White House and Republicans have argued that the massive tax cuts, which included slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, would pay for themselves through strong economic growth. Democrats assailed the tax cuts as benefiting wealthy Americans at the expense of the middle-class.  The updated GDP data, and signs that the economy shifted into lower gear in the second quarter after receiving a boost from exports and an accumulation of unsold goods in the first three months of 2019, are undercutting that argument. Trump likes to showcase the economy as one of the biggest achievements of his first term in office, declaring last July that his administration had “accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.” On the campaign trail, Trump boasted he could boost annual GDP growth to 4%. The downgrade to the 2018 year-on-year measure to below 3% may well irk a commander-in-chief who has been quick to blame the U.S. Federal Reserve in particular for actions he sees as stymieing his growth agenda. The Fed meets on interest rates next week, and Trump has already been jawboning policymakers to cut borrowing costs, which he says would allow the economy to take off “like a rocket ship.” Economists, though, have long cautioned that the 3% growth target was unrealistic, given low productivity among other factors. Economists estimate the economy’s growth potential, or the pace at which it can expand without generating too much inflation, at around 2%.  An alternative measure of economic growth, gross domestic income (GDI), rose 2.5% in 2018. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased 2.7% in 2018. The updated Commerce Department data also showed growth in the second and third quarters of last year was not as robust as previously estimated, and the economy grew much more slowly in the fourth quarter than had been reported in March.  Still, the economy’s performance in 2018 was an acceleration from the 2.4% growth notched in 2017. It matched the performance in 2015 during the Obama administration. The economy grew 2.8% in the 12 months through the fourth quarter of 2017. The data also showed growth in consumer spending peaking in the second quarter and decelerating sharply in the final three months of 2018.  Growth in the first quarter of 2018 was revised up to a 2.5% annualized rate from 2.2%. Second-quarter growth, which prompted Trump’s mission accomplished declaration, was cut to a 3.5% pace from a 4.2% rate. Growth in the third quarter was slashed to a 2.9% rate from a 3.4% pace. Fourth-quarter GDP growth was lowered to a 1.1% pace from a 2.2% rate.  The downward revisions to the three quarters largely reflected downgrades to business investment, suggesting corporations likely did not plow their tax windfall back into their businesses. Some companies like Apple (AAPL.O) used their windfall for share buybacks. But the lower taxes boosted savings last year. The saving rate was raised to 7.7% from 6.7%, reflecting upward revisions to repatriated profit from the rest of the world. Corporate profit estimates were, however, marked down in both 2017 and 2018.

Diego Costa struck in the first minute against Real, who were then three down before the 20-minute mark, and five down by the interval. Real Madrid have conceded 12 goals in three games in the US.",Reuters,"EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (Reuters) - Real Madrid finished their tour of the United States with a 7-3 humiliation by rivals Atletico Madrid in New Jersey on Friday, ensuring they head home in embarrassment from their American excursions. Their tour started in pretty underwhelming fashion with a 3-1 defeat to Bayern Munich in Texas, before they then fell 2-0 behind against Arsenal inside 24 minutes in Washington DC on Tuesday. They fought back in the second half to rescue a 2-2 draw, eventually winning on penalties, but against their city rivals in their final match, Real’s pre-season toils really unravelled. Diego Costa struck in the first minute to stun Real, who found themselves three down before the 20 minute mark, and five down by the interval. Real’s beleaguered backline, which was not by any stretch a second string with captain Sergio Ramos and Marcelo starting, could not cope with the combative Costa, who finished the match with four goals, before being sent off. Late goals from Karim Benzema and Javi Hernandez ensured Atletico did not better their biggest competitive victory over Real — 5-0 in the 1947-48 season — but the damage had been done. Real’s defending will certainly be of great concern to  coach Zinedine Zidane, having seen his side concede 12 goals in three games in the U.S., but there were very few other positives to take from the trip. New big-money signings Eden Hazard and Luka Jovic, who have featured in all three games, mustered just two shots at goal between them in the U.S. “There was no response from us to change something,” Zidane told reporters after the match. “The first part was difficult. We never entered the game. We have lacked everything, especially intensity. “You don’t have to spin it over. It’s a pre-season game. They’ve been better at everything. There is nothing more to talk about. We are preparing a season and being calm.” While Zidane is right that there is only so much you can read into pre-season results, Real’s preparations for the new La Liga season could not have gone much worse. Zidane’s thoughts have been dominated by Gareth Bale’s future since the Frenchman admitted that the club were trying to sell the Welshman, with every press conference since involving yet more questions about where Bale’s future lies. There are still pre-season games left to try and generate some momentum ahead of start of the Spanish season on August 17, but so far, it has not been Real or Zidane’s summer.

Last month, senior Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil resigned from the party and joined the BJP. He was later inducted into Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra cabinet on June 16 along with former Congress leader Ashish Shelar.Several other defections are expected in the next coming days - among leaders whose names are making rounds are Akole MLA Vaibhav Pichad and Shrivardhan MLA Avdhut Tatkare. Apar from these - Baban Shinde from Madha and Dilip Sopal from Barshi - were also absent from a meeting called by former deputy CM Ajit Pawar triggering speculations of the possibility of their exit.This crisis within the two Opposition parties came to fore after the Lok Sabha election drubbing where the duo could only manage 5 of the 48 seats.

284,24 UP jails to get Delhi's Tihar jail-like security,"The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to upgrade security in at least 24 jails along the lines of Delhi's high-security Tihar jail amid reports of security lapses. The upgradation will be implemented in three phases, including deploying 1,300 more personnel, rotating personnel so no staff is at the same spot for over 45 days and frisking visitors, inmates and staff.",The New Indian Express,"LUCKNOW: Be it the gruesome killing of Munna Bajrangi in Baghpat jail premises or inmates seen brandishing weapons in Unnao jail or even  criminals enjoying liquor, getting free run of narcotics  on jail premises are enough examples to establish that jail in UP serves more like the safe houses to hardcore criminals and mafia who remain active from inside and operate at will besides enjoying every luxury on jail premises. A number of videos which went viral on social media recently were telltale signs of flourishing criminal –staff nexus in UP jails. The gravity of the situation can be gauged from the fact that whenever a crime of the magnitude of contract killing, abduction, loot or extortion happens, UP police turns to jails for vital inputs as in many cases, the links could be traced to incarcerated notorious criminals and mafia.In the wake of increasing incidents lawlessness in jails reflecting the connivance between jail staff and criminals, the state government has decided to upgrade security and take other steps in at least two dozen jails of 71 present in the state on the lines of high-security Tihar jail. The hypersensitive jails selected for upgradation include those where hardcore criminals, terror suspects, mafia dons and others are incarcerated.As per the highly-placed sources, the jail administration is believed to have staggered the upgradation into three phases. The first phase would deal with sprucing up a security cordon around the jails. The foremost step proposed would be to deploy around 1300 police personnel on deputation from other forces to man jails’ security. In fact, the aim is to erect a three-layered security cordon cover. The outer most layer would be guarded by cops from other forces. They will be deployed on duty rotation basis and their deployment would be effected by district police chief instead of jail authorities. No one cop would be able to stay at one place or more than 45 days.On the other, the innermost security layer and the administration of the jail would be handled by the jail staff.After addressing the security concerns, the second phase would curb the use of mobile phones on jail premises. In the recent raids at Sultanpur, Deoria, Pratapgarh, Naini in Prayagraj and Barabanki jails, authorities seized mobile phones from the possession of inmates in respectable numbers as the criminals operate their gangs through mobile phones. The jail administration, headed by DG, prisons, Anand Kumar, has already issued a circular in this respect forbidding even the jail staff to carry mobile phones on premises during the duty
hours.The third and final phase would include frisking of visitors, jail inmates and also the jail staff by the cops in those two dozen jails which were chosen to be sensitised.According to sources, the jail staff which remained posted at one jail for years together would now be transferred in order to check staff-inmate ‘nexus’. The prison administration has also sent a proposal to the state government for the recruitment of 3,678 jail staff, including warders and jail guards.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jul/27/two-dozen-of-71-uttar-pradesh-jails-to-be-upgraded-on-lines-of-tihar-2009925.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""We're looking at whole Turkey situation,"" he added. Earlier, Turkey said it would look for other options if the US doesn't sell F-35 jets.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he does not blame Turkey for buying a Russian missile defense system, which prompted his administration to remove the NATO ally from the F-35 fighter jet program. Trump, who was speaking to reporters at the White House, did not say when he would decide on imposing sanctions on Turkey for doing business with the Russian military, as required by a 2017 U.S. sanctions law. “We’re looking at the whole Turkey situation,” Trump said. “It’s a tough situation ... I don’t blame Turkey because there are a lot of circumstances.” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday his country would turn elsewhere for fighter jets if the United States will not sell it the F-35 jets, adding that a U.S. decision to cut Ankara from the program would not deter it from meeting its needs. U.S. lawmakers have said they are unhappy about Turkey’s purchase of the Russian missile defense system, but are unsure what Trump or Congress should do next, suggesting efforts to impose sanctions were on the back burner for now.

293,Trump says will reject tariff relief on China-made Mac Pro parts,"US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to announce his administration will deny tariff reliefs to Apple for its Mac Pro parts manufactured in China. ""Make them in the USA, no tariffs,"" Trump wrote. Apple had asked the US Trade Representative's Office to waive 25% tariffs on 15 parts, including ones for Mac Pro desktop computer, on July 18.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration would not grant Apple Inc any relief for tariffs on parts made in China for its Mac Pro computer and later added he thought the firm would build a plant in Texas. “Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!” Trump tweeted. On July 18, Apple asked the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to waive 25% tariffs on 15 parts, including ones for the Mac Pro desktop computer. The public comment period for those requests closes on Aug. 1. Trump later told reporters he thought Apple would build a plant in Texas, without elaborating on exactly what he was referring to or how he knew. “I want Apple to build their plants in the United States. I don’t want them to build them in China. So when I heard they were going to build it in China, I said, ‘No, that’s OK, you can build it in China but when you send your product into the United States we’re going to tariff you,” he said. “We’ll work it out,” he said. “I think they’re going to announce that they’re going to build a plant in Texas. And if they do that, I’m starting to get very happy.” The Wall Street Journal reported in June that Apple is shifting manufacturing of its new Mac Pro desktop computer to China from Texas. Apple issued a statement at the time that “like all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States” and emphasized that “final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.” Representatives for Apple had no immediate comment on either the tariff or Texas plant comments on Friday. Shares of the company sharply pared their gains after the tweets.     Apple CEO Tim Cook in December 2013 announced the company was building the Mac Pro in Texas after coming under criticism for assembling most of its products in lower-wage countries. Apple does not disclose sales figures for its Mac Pro, but analysts do not believe it is a high-volume seller for the company compared to the iPhone. Priced at $6,000 and up, it is aimed at professional users such as movie and music studios. Trump has previously made claims about Apple’s plans to build new U.S. plants, which have not materialized.  Apple did say in December it would build a second campus in Austin, Texas. The company is also spending $390 million with supplier Finisar Corp that helped the chipmaker re-open a 700,000-square-foot factory in Texas.    Trump has levied billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese imports and threatened to impose levies on another $325 billion of Chinese goods if no progress is reached in a trade dispute that has disrupted global supply chains and shaken financial markets.  For Apple, China is both a key market and a major production center for its devices. The company got nearly 18% of its total revenue from Greater China in the quarter that ended in March. Apple in June asked its major suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving 15% to 30% of its production capacity from China to Southeast Asia, according to a Nikkei report. In its submissions to the U.S. Trade Representative asking for the waivers, Apple said the products were part of a consumer electronic device and “not strategically important or related to Chinese industrial programs, such as “Made in China 2020.”     The parts include graphics processing modules, structural frames, power supply units, AC power cables, ladder assemblies, data cables and a wireless mouse line. Some Apple products such as the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones faced a potential 25% tariff last year, but officials spared Apple and other electronics makers such as Fitbit Inc in September. The Trump administration has denied numerous other tariff exclusion requests from major companies including General Motors Co for its Chinese-made Buick Envision, Tesla Inc for components for its electric vehicles and Uber Technologies Inc for electric bikes.

While Awasthi was questioned for the last two days in the case, Pandey was not coming to EOW HQ for questioning despite summons.The arrests pertained to the tampering of an e-tender floated by the Water Resources Department in 2018.

In this portal, all departments uploaded their tender notices in response to which different companies submitted their bids.In March 2018, it came to the fore that price bids of nine tenders of five state government departments were tampered to help some companies to revise their price bids for getting the contracts for which tenders were floated by the concerned departments.The nine tenders, included three tenders of Jal Nigam, two tenders of Public Works Department, one of Project Implementation Unit (PIU), two of Water Resources Department and one of MP Road Development Corporation.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jul/27/two-former-secretaries-of-ex-mp-minister-narottam-mishra-arrested-in-e-tendering-scam-2009926.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Such clusters are found in the halo of the galaxy and contain considerably more and older stars, according to Pande.Although it appears that globular clusters contain the oldest population of the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear, he said.

Wherever we go, we bring stability,” Nadda told reporters at his maiden press conference where he also shared the Narendra Modi government’s achievements in its first 50 days.Asked about the fact that BJP leader B S Yediyurappa, who took oath as chief minister, is over the 75-year age bar the party has stipulated for its leaders holding any government position, he played it down. Yediyurappa was the leader of the BJP legislature party in the state and it was natural for him to be the party’s choice for the chief minister’s post, he said. “It depends,” he said when quizzed about the party’s age-bar and then added, “you see, first of all he is a leader, he is an elected leader of the legislature party.Accordingly, he is taking oath. It is a continuous process and the party takes note of ongoing developments from time to time.” As the leader of opposition he is alright and the day he takes oath the question is asked about his age, he said, adding that it does not work like that.

344,"Australia name 17-man Ashes squad; Warner, Smith, Bancroft included","Australia on Friday named their 17-member squad for the upcoming Ashes in England. David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft, who served lengthy bans over their involvement in ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year, have been included. The squad, led by wicketkeeper Tim Paine, also includes uncapped pacer Michael Neser. The first Ashes Test will begin on August 1.",Cricket Australia,"Uncapped Queenslander Michael Neser is the surprise selection in Australia's 17-man Ashes squad that is aiming to retain the urn and win in England for the first time since 2001.Neser, the right-arm seam bowling allrounder, is one of seven fast-bowling options in the squad led by world No.1 Test bowler Pat Cummins, alongside Mitch Starc, Josh Hazlewood, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle as well as recalled allrounder Mitchell Marsh.David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft have been selected for their first Test tour since the events in Cape Town last year.Off the back of a mountain of runs at domestic level and starring performances on the Australia A tour of England, Tasmania's Matthew Wade and Queensland's Marnus Labuschagne have earned selection.Wade edged out Alex Carey as the squad's reserve wicketkeeper-batter behind captain Tim Paine, while Labuschagne will also serve as the second spinning option, joining Nathan Lyon, with Jon Holland missing out.Usman Khawaja, who continues to rehabilitate his injured hamstring, has been named and is one of four incumbent batsmen from Australia's last Test against Sri Lanka in February.Khawaja returns with opener Marcus Harris, middle-order batsman Travis Head and Labuschagne, while Joe Burns and Kurtis Patterson, who each made centuries in Canberra against Sri Lanka, are unlucky to miss selection.""It has been a difficult task to reduce the 25-player squad here in Southampton down to 17 and those who have not made the final Ashes party are all desperately unlucky,"" said national selector Trevor Hohns.""However, that problem also highlights that we have a degree of depth to select from and that is a terrific positive.""We have had excellent preparations for this series, with eight players from this squad forming part of the Australia A tour that has been in the UK for more than a month, six who took part in the ICC Cricket World Cup, and three who have been playing county cricket. It means the players are acclimatised and ready for the first Test.""The squad boasts flexibility and experience across the board, highlighted by a bowling attack that has four bowlers – Lyon, Starc, Siddle and Hazlewood – with more than 150 Test wickets each, the first time in history Australia have toured England with such a prolific bowling unit.Neser complements the core bowling group with his ability to swing the Dukes ball both ways, as he has done in the back half of the Sheffield Shield season and in the three four-day matches on tour.The 29-year-old struggled for rhythm early on in the Australia A campaign, but has peaked at the right time with an impressive display against the England Lions in Canterbury and on day one of the intra-squad clash in Southampton, where he claimed 4-18.Neser is also a capable batsman, who averaged 43.72 with five half-centuries in the Shield competition last summer for the Bulls in addition to his 33 wickets at 23.03 runs apiece.Whether Neser makes his Test debut will depend on the fitness and form of Australia's powerful pace battery, which includes Victorian pair Siddle and Pattinson.The 2019 Ashes will be Siddle's sixth Test series against England and enters at perhaps the peak of his powers having taken 34 wickets at just 20.08 in eight matches for Essex, who sit top of the table in Division One of the County Championship.Siddle shares an intimate knowledge of England along with Pattinson, who has dominated in English conditions for Nottinghamshire, with both players the lead voices when it has come to planning and implementing bowling plans on tour so far.It's been a long road back to the Test team for Pattinson, who last wore the Baggy Green in February 2016 in Christchurch.In the three-and-a-half years between Test call-ups, Pattinson suffered heartbreaking back injuries which led the paceman to undergo radical surgery in November 2017, a last-ditch effort with the 2019 Ashes in mind as his international comeback.The 29-year-old has bowled the house down for Victoria, Nottinghamshire and Australia A this year and is a frontrunner for the first Ashes Test in Birmingham from August 1.Pattinson's and Siddle's stellar performances in the all-Australian clash in Southampton secured their spots, and the same goes for Bancroft and Labuschagne.Bancroft posted an unbeaten 93 over four hours in the fourth innings on a pitch described as ""borderline dangerous"" to guide the Graeme Hick XII to a five-wicket win.The right-hander's effort, combined with his solid form for Durham in county cricket (726 runs at 45 with two centuries) was enough for the selectors to give him the nod.He joins Smith and Warner in the Test squad, the first time all three have been eligible for Test selection following their bans (nine months for Bancroft, 12 months for Smith and Warner) in the wake of Cape Town.  Labuschagne has barely had a day to rest since October last year, having made his Test debut in the UAE, played a full summer of domestic cricket for the Bulls, returned to the Test setup in the new year, completed the Shield season before heading straight to Wales to begin his stint with Glamorgan.The energetic right-hander has made the most of his time in the UK, scoring five centuries to lead the run-scorers list in Division Two of the County Championship, and bowl 192 overs of his improving leg-spin, where he has said it has taken time to adjust to bowling with the Dukes ball.But it was his knock of 41 on Tuesday that might have secured his Ashes spot as he batted for more than two hours on the spicy Southampton pitch where his side crumbled to be all out for 105 on a day where 17 wickets fell.While Wade failed to post a big score at the Rose Bowl, he has made a habit of going large over the past 18 months in all forms of cricket.Alongside Harris, Wade is the other player to accumulate more than 1000 runs during last summer's Shield season, and started the Australia A tour with a bang, scoring whirlwind centuries against Northamptonshire and Derbyshire, the latter the fastest List A hundred by an Australian from just 45 balls.He backed up those scores with 114 against a strong England Lions attack that featured England Test bowlers Sam Curran and Jack Leach and squad member Lewis Gregory.Of the players unlucky to miss out, Tasmania's Jackson Bird is at the top of the list.The 32-year-old captured 50 wickets in the Shield cricket last summer and was perhaps the best bowler behind Pattinson on the A tour, but it appears Neser's ability with the bat might have given the Queenslander the edge.The 17-man squad travels to Birmingham tomorrow to begin preparations for the first Ashes Test, which starts on Thursday.The last time Australia's men's side won the Ashes on English soil was 18 years ago when Steve Waugh captained a star-studded side to a 4-1 series triumph.Waugh is part of Australia's squad as a mentor until the second Test at Lord's and said on selection morning he is ""convinced"" the current crop has what it takes to break the drought.2019 Qantas Ashes Tour of EnglandAustralia squad: Tim Paine (c), Cameron Bancroft, Pat Cummins, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Michael Neser, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle, Steven Smith, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner.First Test: August 1-5, EdgbastonTour match: Australians v Worcestershire, August 7-9Second Test: August 14-18,Lord'sThird Test: August 22-26, HeadingleyTour match: Australians v Derbyshire, August 29-31Fourth Test: September 4-8, Old TraffordFifth Test: September 12-16, The Oval",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/australia-2019-ashes-squad-england-tests-paine-smith-warner-pattinson-wade-marsh-bancroft-neser/2019-07-27?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

She accused Google of threatening free speech, fair elections and democracy.",Engadget,"Tulsi Gabbard, one of the many Democratic presidential hopefuls, is suing Google for at least $50 million. Gabbard filed a federal lawsuit against the company today, claiming that it suspended her campaign's advertising account for six hours following the first Democratic debate. Doing so, the lawsuit reportedly states, infringed on Gabbard's free speech.According to The New York Times, after the first debate, Gabbard was briefly the most searched-for candidate on Google. Purchasing ads would have helped the campaign get its website at the top of the search results, Tulsi Now Inc. said. The campaign team also believes its emails were being placed in Gmail spam folders at ""a disproportionately high rate"" compared to other Democratic contenders.TULSI2020: In the hours following the 1st debate, while millions of Americans searched for info about Tulsi, Google suspended her search ad account w/o explanation. It is vital to our democracy that big tech companies can't affect the outcome of elections https://t.co/n7Y7y2dQZ9Google told The New York Times that its automated systems flag unusual activity from advertisers, like a sudden increase in spending.

""We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology.""Gabbard was relatively unknown before the first Democratic debate, but one of the issues she has gained bipartisan support for is her suspicion of big tech. According to the lawsuit, she sides with Senator Elizabeth Warren in the call for large tech companies to be broken up -- Warren recently had an ad criticizing Facebook removed and then restored by the platform. While this lawsuit may not go anywhere, it is believed to be the first time a presidential candidate has sued a major tech firm. It's a bit surprising that it's coming from a Democratic candidate, given that most of the recent censorship complaints and bias accusations have come from Republicans.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/25/tulsi-gabbard-sues-google-censorship/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Mittal heads the supervisory board and co-owns metallurgical coke producer GIKIL in northern Bosnia. Prosecutors said that he invoked his right to remain silent during the questioning.",Reuters,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A court in Bosnia on Thursday ordered a one-month detention for Indian businessman Pramod Mittal and two other officials who have been suspected of involvement with organised crime and abuse of office at a Bosnian coke plant, regional television reported. Mittal, younger brother of steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, heads the supervisory board and co-owns metallurgical coke producer Global Ispat Koksna Industrija Lukavac (GIKIL) in northern Bosnia, one of the country’s biggest exporters. Mittal has been held in police custody since Tuesday, along with GIKIL’s general manager, Paramesh Bhattacharyya, and supervisory board member Razib Dash. Prosecutor Camil Serhatlic told Reuters that Mittal and the other two executives invoked their right to remain silent during the questioning in the town of Tuzla, and that the prosecution asked the Tuzla cantonal court for their detention.  Regional television in Bosnia’s Bosniak-Croat Federation reported that the court then ordered a one-month detention for the trio. Neither the men nor their lawyers were immediately reachable for comment. A spokeswoman for GIKIL told Reuters she was not officially notified about the court’s order, which occurred during evening hours on Thursday. Police said they seized documentation, computers and cell phones during a raid at GIKIL on Tuesday.  GIKIL union members said on Thursday the plant’s operation was not interrupted. GIKIL, with around 1,000 employees in the town of Lukavac, is jointly run by Dubai-based Global Steel Holdings Ltd (GSH) and local government-owned KHK since 2003. Last year, Bosnian police briefly detained GIKIL’s then-general manager over environmental negligence. He fled Bosnia just before the indictment against him was confirmed in early in 2019, the prosecutors said.

Apple will intake 2,200 Intel workers along with equipment, intellectual property and leases. Notably, Intel had cancelled plans for 5G modems after Apple settled its 2-year-long dispute with Qualcomm.",Engadget,"The rumors were (mostly) true -- Apple is buying the ""majority"" of Intel's smartphone modem business for $1 billion.  The deal will see Apple take on 2,200 Intel workers as well as equipment, intellectual property and leases.  Apple expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 so long as regulators approve the handover.The arrangement still gives Intel the ability to develop modems for computers, Internet of Things devices and self-driving cars.  It's not completely out of the cellular chipset business, then, it's just scaling back.  This will let the chip designer focus on 5G in spaces where it ""most closely aligns"" with what its customers want.  Its phone modems weren't that popular beyond Apple, to put it another way, and this gives it a chance to refocus.Apple wasn't shy about its plans for the acquisition.  The move would fuel its ""growing cellular technologies group"" and help ""expedite"" the creation of future products that stand out from the pack.  The tech giant has repeatedly hinted at designing its own cellular hardware to obtain more control over its fate, and it has been aggressively recruiting staff to make that happen.Intel might not have had much choice but to sell.  When Apple and Qualcomm settled their patent dispute and signed a multi-year chipset deal, that effectively negated the need for Intel modems in Apple devices.  It's no coincidence that Intel cancelled plans for 5G phone modems within hours of the patent truce becoming public.  The company either had to persuade Android device makers to embrace its modems (a difficult prospect given Qualcomm's dominance) or halt much of its work.This doesn't mean that you'll see a legion of iPhones and iPads with Apple-badged Intel modems.  This is more about acquiring talent and ideas.  Think of it as you might Apple's purchase of PA Semiconductor -- it's a long-term bet that the newly-acquired knowhow will translate to not just higher performance, but greater independence.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/25/apple-buys-intel-smartphone-modem-business/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

379,Fake US presidential seal used during Trump's speech,"A fake US presidential seal was used during President Donald Trump's speech at an event in Washington DC on Tuesday. The image included a two-headed eagle resembling that in the Russian coat of arms. The eagle in the image had golf clubs in its left talons, instead of arrows, and cash in its right talons, instead of an olive branch.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials on Thursday were baffled as to why a doctored presidential seal - including an eagle clutching golf clubs in its talons instead of arrows - was projected on stage at an event at which U.S. President Donald Trump spoke. The seal was displayed on Tuesday at Turning Point USA’s student summit, where Trump gave a raucous 80-minute speech and was greeted warmly by the youthful audience. The image included a two-headed eagle, instead of just one head, which closely resembles the bird on the Russian coat of arms. The eagle is holding golf clubs in its left talons, instead of the traditional seal’s clutch of arrows, and cash in its right talons, instead of an olive branch. The actual seal says “E Pluribus Unum,” which means “from many one” in Latin, on the banner above the bird’s head. The altered seal said, “45 es un títere,” which in Spanish means “45 is a puppet.” Trump is the 45th president of the United States. In addition, the shield on the bird’s chest has hammer-and-sickle symbols on it.   There were suspicions at the White House that the organizers had found the doctored image online and mistakenly used it. “We never saw the seal in question before it appeared in the video,” said a White House official. “The White House had no knowledge of it.” Officials referred questions to Turning Point USA, which could not immediately be reached for comment. The political non-profit group was founded to organize conservative students on college campuses by Charlie Kirk, an outspoken supporter of Trump. It maintains a controversial Professor Watchlist of college professors it deems too liberal. As a political non-profit, the group may raise and spend unlimited sums of money and engage in educational efforts around politics, but it is prohibited from using its resources to campaign for a candidate for elected office.

The US removed Turkey from the F-35 programme over Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence system.",Reuters,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday Turkey would turn elsewhere for fighter jets if the United States will not sell it the F-35 jets, adding that a U.S. decision to cut Ankara from the program would not deter it from meeting its needs.  The United States said last week it was removing NATO ally Turkey from the F-35 program, as long threatened, after Ankara purchased and received delivery of Russian S-400 missile defenses that Washington sees as a threat. Washington has also threatened sanctions on Turkey, though Ankara has dismissed the warnings. It has instead put its trust in sympathetic comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said that Turkey was treated “unfairly”. Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday he does not blame Turkey for buying the Russian air defense system, but did not say when he would decide on imposing sanctions on Turkey for doing business with the Russian military, as required by a 2017 U.S. law. “We’re looking at the whole Turkey situation,” Trump said. “It’s a tough situation ... I don’t blame Turkey because there are a lot of circumstances.” Erdogan, speaking publicly about the strained U.S. ties for the first time in 11 days, said he hoped U.S. officials would be “reasonable” on the question of sanctions, adding that Turkey may also reconsider its purchase of advanced Boeing (BA.N) aircraft from the United States. “Are you not giving us the F-35s? Okay, then excuse us but we will once again have to take measures on that matter as well and we will turn elsewhere,” Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party. “Even if we’re not getting F-35s, we are buying 100 advanced Boeing aircrafts, the agreement is signed... At the moment, one of the Boeing planes has arrived and we are making the payments, we are good customers,” he said. “But, if things continue like this, we will have to reconsider this.” Russia’s Rostec state conglomerate said Russia would be ready to supply its SU-35 jets to Turkey if Ankara requested them. But, Turkish officials said on Thursday there were no talks with Moscow on alternatives to the F-35 jets for now. Ties between Ankara and Washington have been strained over a host of issues. Turkey has also been infuriated with U.S. support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, a main U.S. ally in the region that Ankara sees as a terrorist organization.  Ankara has warned that it would launch a military operation in northern Syria to wipe out the YPG if it could not agree with Washington on the planned safe zone in the region, saying it had run “out of patience.” However, Erdogan said on Friday that Turkey is determined to destroy the “terror corridor” east of the Euphrates river in Syria no matter how talks on the safe zone conclude, as Ankara ramped up its threats of an offensive.

""I'd like a chance to go, not do propaganda but speak the truth to the Iranian people about how their leadership has harmed Iran,"" he added.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday he was willing to go to Iran for talks amid tensions between Tehran and Washington, but also called on Japan, Britain and other nations to join a maritime force to guard oil tankers sailing through the Strait of Hormuz. Asked if he would be willing to go to Tehran, Pompeo said in an interview with Bloomberg TV: “Sure. If that’s the call, I’d happily go there... I would welcome the chance to speak directly to the Iranian people.” Tensions between Iran and the United States have ratcheted up since last year, when President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Iranian nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, saying it was not strong enough. Washington also reimposed sanctions on Tehran.    Trump and Iranian leaders have both publicly said talks were possible, but the prospect for dialogue appeared to recede on Wednesday when the top military adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tehran would not negotiate with Washington under any circumstances. The relationship between the two countries has come under increased strain over the past three months following attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz off the coast of Iran. In a separate interview broadcast by Fox News, Pompeo said that Washington had already asked Japan, France, Germany, South Korea, Australia and other nations to join a planned maritime security initiative in the Middle East. “Every country that has an interest in ensuring that those waterways are open and crude oil and other products can flow through the Strait of Hormuz needs to participate,” Pompeo said.  A senior diplomat in Japan, Washington’s key Asian ally, told Reuters that Pompeo had talked with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by telephone on Friday, but that Japan was not in a position to decide if or how it could join any maritime force until the United Sates provided a blueprint of how such an operation would work. “We don’t know where they want to lead,” he said, asking not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media.      Pompeo’s comments came after Iran on Wednesday tested what appeared to be a medium-range ballistic missile that traveled about 1,000 km (620 miles), said a U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The test did not pose a threat to shipping or any U.S. personnel in the region, the official said. (The story is refiled to fix typo in paragraph five.)

382,Regulators clear Mahindra's GA8 planes to fly again after crash,"Aviation regulators in Australia, New Zealand and the European Union have lifted orders grounding the single-engine GA8 planes, made by Mahindra Aerospace. Nine Swedes were killed when a GA8, dubbed the Airvan 8, crashed during a skydiving trip in northern Sweden on July 14. There are 228 GA8 planes worldwide, 63 of which are registered in Australia.",Reuters,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Aviation regulators in Australia, New Zealand and the European Union have lifted orders grounding GippsAero GA8 planes after initial results of an inquiry into a crash in Sweden this month that killed nine people, the regulators said on their websites. Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) said the precautionary suspension was triggered by initial information that the plane had broken up in flight. However, it had since received information that there was no evidence of a potential unsafe condition associated with the aircraft, it added. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said CASA had informed it that an inspection of the crashed plane showed it appeared to have been exposed to aerodynamic loads beyond certification levels. In a statement, Graeme Harris, the director civil aviation in New Zealand, said travelers, operators and pilots of the country’s 21 affected aircraft could now be assured that concerns expressed after the accident had been tackled. “We will continue to monitor the investigation into the GA8 accident and will take appropriate action should any related safety issues become apparent,” he added. The single-engine GA8 is made in Australia by Mahindra Aerospace, a unit of India’s Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (MAHM.NS), and 63 of the 228 planes worldwide are registered in Australia, CASA says. Nine Swedes were killed when a GA8, dubbed the Airvan 8, crashed during a skydiving trip near the city of Umea in northern Sweden on July 14. The GA8 is typically used for skydiving, tourism, air patrols, medical evacuations and humanitarian missions in remote locations, Mahindra Aerospace says on its website. In an emailed statement, Keith Douglas, the chief executive of its GippsAero unit, said the company was grateful for customers’ support and would act if any related safety issues emerged.

389,26 of 28 Cong Cabinet Ministers in MP are my friends: BJP MLA,"BJP MLA Sanjay Satyendra Pathak on Thursday refuted rumours of joining Congress saying, though he is friends with 26 of the 28 Congress ministers in the Madhya Pradesh cabinet, BJP will continue being his home. Rumours of BJP leaders joining Congress started after two BJP MLAs voted along with Congress on an amendment bill in the State Assembly on Wednesday.",The New Indian Express,"BHOPAL: Mining baron-turned-richest MLA of Madhya Pradesh, the BJP legislator Sanjay Satyendra Pathak put to rest on Thursday speculations about the possibility of him joining Congress.""26 out of 28 present Congress ministers in MP are my friends, but BJP will continue to be my home,"" said Pathak.Speculations have been rife about his crossover to his old party Congress, in the wake of two other saffron party MLAs, Narayan Tripathi and Sharad Kol voting along with the ruling party and ally legislators on an amendment bill in the Vidhan Sabha on Wednesday evening.The four-time BJP legislator from Vijayraghogarh constituency of Katni district, who owns assets worth Rs 216 crores-plus said, “Everyone knows that my father Satyendra Pathak was not only a Congress MLA in 1993 and 1998, but also a cabinet minister in the erstwhile Digvijaya Singh government in MP, besides holding key organizational positions in the MP Congress unit. I keep on meeting present Congress MLAs and ministers, as many of the young ones have been my childhood and young day friends. At least 26 out of the 28 cabinet ministers of the present Congress government share personal bonding with me,” said Pathak on Thursday.“I certainly have a Congress family background, owing to which there are often rumours about me joining the Congress. But let me assure you, my home now is the BJP, where I’m going to stay. Since 26 out of 28 ministers of present Congress government are known to me, hence they keep on making offers to me to return to Congress fold. But for me BJP will continue to be my home,” said Pathak.Importantly, just like his ex-MP minister father Satyendra Pathak, the present BJP MLA Sanjay Pathak won from father’s pocket-borough Vijayraghogarh in 2008 and 2013 as Congress candidate but quit the grand old party to join the BJP in 2014.He was re-elected in the by-election thereafter as BJP candidate and also won from the same seat on BJP ticket for the fourth time in 2018.He was also a minister of state in the former Shivraj Singh Chouhan government and was among the Congressmen who joined the BJP during the Chouhan government, just like Narayan Tripathi (Maihar) and Sharad Kol (Beohari seat) – both of whom voted with Congress MLAs in the Vidhan Sabha on Wednesday evening.Pathak, however, had a word of advice for his former party, the Congress, on the issue of voting on the criminal procedure code (MP Amendment Bill) on Wednesday evening.“When the BJP and Congress, both were in favour of passing the bill unanimously with a voice vote, the Congress shouldn’t have backed the BSP MLA Sanjiv Singh’s demand for division of votes on the passage of the bill,” said Pathak.On Thursday, Pathak’s visit to State Secretariat in Bhopal to meet a minister of Congress government triggered speculations about him having met Chief Minister Kamal Nath, but he denied a meeting with the CM.Since the Wednesday’s evening development in the Vidhan Sabha, speculations about Sanjay Pathak and two other BJP MLAs, Sudesh Rai (Sehore) and Dinesh Rai ‘Munmun’ (Seoni) – both independent MLAs between 2013 and 2018, but having won the 2018 polls as BJP MLAs – joining the Congress are doing rounds of political circles in MP.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jul/26/26-out-of-28-congress-ministers-in-mp-are-my-friends-but-bjp-will-continue-to-be-my-home-sanjay-2009427.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Forty nine self-styled 'guardians' and 'conscience keepers' of the nation and of democratic values have once again expressed selective concern and demonstrated a clear political bias and motive,"" the letter by 62 personalities reads.It terms the letter on lynching incidents a ""document of selective outrage"" that comes across as an attempt to ""foist a FALSE NARRATIVE with the intention of denigrating the democratic ethos and norms of our collective functioning as a nation and people.""""It is aimed at tarnishing India's international standing and to negatively portray Prime Minister Modi's untiring efforts to effectuate governance on the foundations of positive nationalism and humanism which is the core of INDIANNESS,"" the letter read.""The signatories to the 'open letter' have, in the past, kept silent when tribals and the marginalised have become victims of Naxal terror, they have kept silent when separatists have issued dictates to burn schools in Kashmir, they have kept silent when the demand for dismembering India, for making pieces of her -Tukde Tukde - were made, they kept silent when slogans chanted by terrorists and terror groups were echoed in some leading university campuses in the country,"" it added.The new letter also includes names of Grammy Award winner instrumentalist Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, filmmakers Madhur Bhandarkar, Vivek Agnihotri and Ashok Pandit, actor Pallavi Joshi, folk artist Malini Awasthi, actor Manoj Joshi and film personality Biswajit Chatterjee among others.Altogether, they have said that for the 49 celebrities, who earlier wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, ""it seems the freedom, unity and integrity of India can be bartered away in the name of freedom of speech and expression.""""But for us, the unity and integrity of India, her freedom is sacrosanct and anyone who questions these, who works to dilute or destroy these, who conspires to disturb these need to be resisted.

402,US resumes use of death penalty after 16 years,The US Justice Department is set to resume the use of death penalty after 16 years. The department has immediately scheduled executions of five death row federal inmates. There are currently 62 federal inmates on death row. US President Donald Trump has called for increasing the use of the death penalty for drug traffickers and mass shooters.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday reinstated a two-decades-long dormant policy allowing the federal government’s use of capital punishment and immediately scheduled the executions for five death row federal inmates. “Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people’s representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,” Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.   “The Justice Department upholds the rule of law - and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.” The last federal execution took place in 2003. Since then, protracted litigation over the drugs historically used in lethal injection executions prevented the government from continuing the practice, according to Justice Department officials. U.S. President Donald Trump has called for increasing the use of the death penalty for drug traffickers and mass shooters, a request the department has since laid the groundwork to carry out. Early in the Trump administration, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the Federal Bureau of Prisons to examine what steps might be required to resume the use of the death penalty, a Justice Department official said. In March 2018, Sessions also called on federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty when bringing cases against drug dealers and traffickers as part of a strategy to help combat the opioid crisis. Most recently in May, the department’s Office of Legal Counsel took steps to make it easier for states to carry out executions by declaring that the Food and Drug Administration lacked the power to regulate lethal injection drugs. The Senate Judiciary Committee’s ranking Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, said Thursday’s announcement was wrong. “The federal government should be leading the effort to end this brutal and often cruel punishment, not advocating for its return. It’s time we evolve and put this terrible practice behind us,” she said in a statement. U.S. public support for the death penalty has declined since the 1990s, according to opinion polls, and all European Union nations have abolished it.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres believes the practice should not happen anywhere, spokesman Farhan Haq said. “All the countries that continue to impose the death penalty on the population are flying in the face of what the U.N. believes is the principled position to end this sort of penalty once and for all,” Haq told reporters. There are also deep divisions on the U.S. Supreme Court over the death penalty and how it is implemented. Some liberal justices have said that capital punishment as currently employed in the United States may run afoul of the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. They have also raised questions over lethal injection.  But the conservative-majority court, with two justices appointed by Trump, has given little indication of being willing to rule the death penalty unconstitutional. There are currently 62 federal inmates on death row, including Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who planted a deadly bomb at the Boston Marathon in 2013. Of those 62, 41.9 percent are black, 43.6 percent are white, 11.3 percent are Latino, and Asians and Native Americans each make up 1.6 percent of the federal death row population, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Nearly half of all federal death sentences are from Texas, Virginia and Missouri. “We see really deep geographical and racial bias in the death penalty,” said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the Capital Punishment Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, who added that the Justice Department’s move to bring back executions is out of step with the views of most Americans. The Justice Department said it has scheduled executions for five federal inmates who have been convicted of horrific murders and sex crimes, with more planned in the future. All five will be executed by lethal injection using a single drug: pentobarbital. Since 2010, 14 states have switched to using pentobarbital to carry out more than 200 executions, after they were unable to obtain the chemicals needed to execute people using a drug  cocktail. The federal inmates include Daniel Lewis Lee, a white supremacist who was convicted in Arkansas for murdering a family of three, including an 8-year-old girl.  Another is Lezmond Mitchell, a Native American who was found guilty by a jury in Arizona of stabbing a 63-year-old grandmother and forcing her young granddaughter to sit next to her lifeless body on a car journey before slitting the girl’s throat. The other three inmates who will be executed are Wesley Ira Purkey, who raped and murdered a teenaged girl; Alfred Bourgeois, who sexually molested and killed his young daughter; and Dustin Lee Honken, who shot and killed five people. Lee will be the first one to be executed, with the date set for Dec. 9, 2019. Morris Moon, an attorney for Lee, said in a statement that the trial judge, lead prosecutor and family members of the victims all oppose executing his client, and that unreliable and faulty evidence including hair later proven not to have come from Lee were used against him. “Given the problems that undermine the fairness and reliability of Danny Lee’s conviction and death sentence, the Government should not move forward with his execution,” Moon said. The Justice Department said all five executions will take place at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana.  “Each of these inmates has exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies,” the department added.

423,Change in Team India coach may affect team: BCCI official,"A BCCI official has said that Team India head coach Ravi Shastri and captain Virat Kohli complement each other well and it would be unfair to change half of a team that has been successful. ""A change in coach may prove to disturb the equation that exists, which allows the players to have the mental space to excel,"" he added.",India.com,"Even as the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) invited applications for the position of head coach and support staff of the Indian team, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials believe that it is important that Ravi Shastri continues as the head coach as that will help Virat Kohli evolve further as captain.Shastri took over the reins as head coach of Team India after Anil Kumble’s infamous departure in 2017. Kumble’s working style and his methods were not liked by skipper Kohli which ended the partnership pre-maturely. Since then, Shastri took the command of the proceedings and helped the team in attaining the numero uno spot in Tests. He also shares a good rapport with most of the players and known for his man-management skills.A senior BCCI official said that it was important to continue with Shastri and Kohli as the two heads in the process of transition as the team looks to back youngsters with an eye on the 2020 World T20 as well as the 2023 ODI World Cup.“Nothing permanent with a long term effect should happen at this stage of transition. Shastri and Kohli complement each other well and it would be unfair to change half of a team that has been successful,” the BCCI official was quoted by IANS.The official added that it was important to maintain continuity as a change in coach could mean that the players would have to adapt to his ways from the beginning and the equation that already exists in the Indian dressing room would go for a toss.“A change in coach may prove to disturb the equation that exists which allows the players to have the mental space to excel. If a change is made at this stage, then it would be a change of strategy and planning for the next 5 years. It would be unfair to take such a decision at a stage when the stakeholders are not the ones deciding,” the official explained.The BCCI invited applications for the positions of head coach, batting coach, bowling coach, fielding coach, physio, strength and conditioning coach and administrative manager for the Indian team on July 16. Shastri and his team will get an automatic entry into the recruitment process.The current coaching staff were handed a 45-day extension after their tenure ended with the World Cup.

495,"England once used 4 wicketkeepers in a Test, no one took a catch","During a Test against New Zealand from July 24-29, 1986, England fielded four different wicketkeepers. Designated wicketkeeper Bruce French got injured while batting and got to keep only on the fourth day for one ball. Bill Athey, Bobby Parks and retired cricketer Bob Taylor, who was doing PR work at the stadium, also kept but no one registered a catch.",Cricket Country,"On July 25, 1986, England fielded four wicketkeepers at various times, owing to an injury to the original man Bruce French. Two of the substitutes included Bob Taylor — the legend who was already two years into his retirement and Bobby Parks — the Hampshire cricketer who never donned a Test cap again. Karthik Parimal revisits the Test that will be remembered for this unique statistic.Having retired from international cricket two years ago, Bob Taylor was savouring the sight of the English players carve up a New Zealand attack that, apart from Richard Hadlee, looked frail and ready to disintegrate. On the first day, from the fine confines of a stand at the majestic Lord’s, he saw Martyn Moxon and David Gower score a stoic 74 and 62 respectively, while simultaneously performing his duties as a host for the match’s sponsor Cornhill. The next morning, he applauded Hadlee’s 26th five-wicket haul when the latter had Phil Edmonds caught by Martin Crowe in the slip cordon.At 258 for 6, England were in a fix when Bruce French, the wicketkeeper, walked out to consolidate. In his 12th delivery, he turned away from a Hadlee bouncer that eventually struck him on the back of the helmet. He collapsed on the floor and it had immediately become evident that the blow wasn’t a mild one. When the helmet came off, blood trickled out from the cut and it was later made known that three stitches were required to cover the wound up.England’s innings resumed, Hadlee picked up his sixth wicket, and the final total on the board was 307. The Kiwis had staged a fine comeback, although Wisden rightly noted that “two different games were taking place — one when Hadlee was bowling and the other when he was out of the attack.”When New Zealand’s first innings commenced, French was in no shape to take the field. In fact, his participation in the rest of the first Cornhill Test was under a shadow. One expected Bobby Parks, the Hampshire cricketer, to don the ’keeper’s gloves, but he was not the first name that popped into the management’s heads. Instead, the less proficient Bill Athey took his place behind the stumps, but it was only for 2 overs.A frantic search for Taylor, England’s retired wicketkeeper, was on in the meanwhile. Having convinced him that he was the man for the moment, England then asked for New Zealand skipper Jeremy Coney’s consent to make the switch, and the latter duly obliged.So, at 45, Taylor came out of his retirement to keep wickets for his country one last time. Although he had to borrow a kit, his wicketkeeping gloves were, incredibly, in his car. Although no catches or stumping opportunities came his way, Taylor was undoubtedly flawless behind the stumps. Not once there was a hint of untidiness in the way he collected each delivery. The English camp would have preferred he carried on, but the right thing was eventually done as Parks was called upon to take over from where Taylor had left.In all, four wicketkeepers were used during the course of the innings, the first such instance in the history of cricket, and one that is yet to be repeated.Despite all the commotion behind the wickets, New Zealand trudged along nicely, riding on Crowe’s century and Bruce Edgar’s 83. For England, Graham Dilley and Edmonds were amongst the scalps, but none of them could be attributed to the ‘keeper for he had received no opportunity to effect a dismissal. He worked the whole of the third day and, on the fourth morning, French resumed, but for just one ball, since Dilley took his fourth wicket to pull the curtains on New Zealand’s innings at 342.In their second outing, England galloped to 295 for 6 and the innings was declared when French was the next batsman in. Gooch amassed 183, a knock that took over seven hours to etch and seized away the Man-of-the-Match award from Hadlee. In reply, New Zealand batted for 15 overs and stumps were called when the scorecard read 41 for 2. The target was 261 and, due to lack of time, the match duly ended in a turgid draw.Brief scores:England 307 (Martyn Moxon 74, David Gower 62; Richard Hadlee 6 for 80) and 295 for 6 declared (Graham Gooch 183; Evan Gray 3 for 83) drew with New Zealand 342 (Martin Crowe 106, Bruce Edgar 83; Graham Dilley 4 for 82, Phil Edmonds 4 for 97) and 41 for 2.(Karthik Parimal, a Correspondent with CricketCountry, is a cricket aficionado and a worshipper of the game.

""It's a loaded question, one I cannot answer in short,"" he added.",Times Now,"Abhay Deol is not just a stellar performer but also has a great sense of humour. While the actor posts his photos on Instagram, every now and then, he also puts out something that is enough to tickle the funny bone of his followers. He did something similar earlier today when he posted a meme on Instagram that was shared on social media by someone and was centered around his career trajectory.

The meme was a two-column photo. While one section had the photo of Abhay with his name written on top, the other column was empty with the words ‘Ab-nahi-hay’ marked on it.

The actor posted the meme on Instagram with the caption, “Found this online. Illustrates very well a question I get asked by the people and the press all the time. “Why do we not see you more often on the big screen?” It’s a loaded question, one I cannot answer in short. Maybe one day I will write a book about it. But then, I’ve already raked up enough trouble over the years, a book might land too many punches! But for all of you who want more let me tell you that I have 3 films in post production and I’m starting 2 more.

497,"WhatsApp Pay to roll out this year in India, confirms Global Head","Facebook-owned WhatsApp's payments service WhatsApp Pay will be rolling out later this year in India, the platform's Global Head Will Cathcart confirmed. Facebook has been beta-testing the payments service in India with about 10 lakh users, the full roll-out of which was stuck over regulatory issues. The RBI had said it didn't comply with the data localisation norms of India.",The Financial Express,"WhatsApp, which has over 400 million users of its messaging service in India, plans to roll out its much-awaited payments service in the country later this year, more than a year after it began testing the offering here. The Facebook-owned company has been testing its payments service in the country since last year with about a million users, but could not launch full-fledged services as it has been awaiting regulatory approvals.Speaking at an event here on Thursday, WhatsApp Global Head Will Cathcart said the company’s vision is to make sending money as easy as sending messages on the platform. “We built payments based on the UPI standard, partnered with banks here in India… We believe that if we did this right, it will accelerate financial inclusion and bring more people in India’s fast-growing digital economy. We can’t wait to provide the service to more of our users all across India later this year,” he said.Cathcart, however, did not clarify whether the company has received a go-ahead from the regulator and policy makers on the planned launch.WhatsApp’s service, which would compete against the likes of Paytm, PhonePe and Google Pay, is yet to be rolled out nationally in India. The company, which has over 1.5 billion users globally, is looking at rolling out payments service in other markets as well.WhatsApp’s ambitious payment services’ blueprint in India has been caught in a bind over concerns around authentication and its data storage practices. In the past, its home-grown rivals have alleged that WhatsApp’s payment platform has security risks for consumers and is not in compliance with the guidelines.In October last year, WhatsApp had said it had developed a system to store payments-related data in India as part of compliance with the regulator Reserve Bank of India’s policy on storing such data locally. In May this year, WhatsApp had told the Supreme Court that its trial run was likely to be completed by July, and that it will not launch payments services in India without fully complying with the central bank norms.RBI, last month, had clarified that all data related to payments, including those processed abroad, must be stored only in India. Also, in case the payment processing is done abroad, the data should be deleted from the systems there and brought back to India within 24 hours, it had stated.Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, during his address at the event, said “…400 million Indians are using WhatsApp, out of the base of 1.5 billion” and that he expects the local number to rise to a billion-plus in the next three years. In 2017, the company had said its India user base was at over 200 million. However, it hasn’t provided an official update to that number since then. “And I can assure you in the next three years, it will be a billion plus from India,” he said.WhatsApp is partnering with the Women Transforming India (WTI) Awards 2019, flagship initiative of Niti Aayog and will provide support amounting to USD 100,000 for the WTI winners.The WTI Awards, which Niti Aayog organises in partnership with the United Nations, recognises stories of exceptional achievements by women who are breaking the glass ceiling and challenging stereotypes through businesses, enterprises, and initiatives aimed at solving key societal challenges.“Small businesses are the backbone of a strong economy and I am proud of the role WhatsApp can play in helping build the next generation of India’s women entrepreneurs,” Cathcart said, pointing out the importance of investing in building digital skills.He said the company will pilot enhanced WhatsApp training modules with startups.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

Speaking to a daily about embracing fatherhood, the comedian said, “I just want to take care of my wife and be by her side for now. We are obviously very excited as it’s our first kid but my mother is the most excited. She has been waiting for this moment for years now. We are just praying for Ginni and the baby’s health.”Talking about preparing for fatherhood, he said, “There is no prep because we don’t know if it would be a boy or girl. It’s a happy time for the family and everybody is looking forward to welcome the new member. I am dubbing for a film for children. So, once the baby grows up, it will pay off.” Fans are quite excited about this new phase in Kapil’s life. Kapil and Ginni tied the knot in December last year in a lavish ceremony.  Kapil also made a comeback with his show post his marriage with Ginni and it has been raking in high ratings ever since the first episode.

WeWork declined to comment. WeWork will host an analyst day for Wall Street banks on July 31 as part of preparations for its IPO, Reuters reported last week. WeWork is also looking to raise $5 billion to $6 billion through a bond offering before the IPO, the source added, requesting anonymity because the matter is private. This is more than it had previously been looking to raise. The debt offering could provide comfort to those investing in the IPO who might be concerned that the cash burn at WeWork is so great it will need to raise more money after the initial offering, which would dilute their shareholdings. “That’s a very known psychology by underwriters and IPO investors, and (that fear), that’s something people try to guard against,” said Adam Troso, head of real estate corporate advisory at Greenhill & Co in New York.  WeWork was recently valued at $47 billion in a private fundraising round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. However, the money-losing company has faced questions about the sustainability of its business model, which is based on short-term revenue agreements and long-term loan liabilities. The losses at WeWork’s parent company narrowed slightly in the first quarter of 2019 to $264 million as revenue continues to double annually.

He claims that the girls approached him to expose the 23-year-old and all this has happened in last six months which also includes the World Cup campaign.In some of the chats, Imam-ul-Haq could be seen mentioning the girls as ‘baby’ and giving her information about his whereabouts. In other chats, the cricketer is fighting with the girl in an attempt to break up with her and the Twitter user claims that he manipulated and used them. He has tweeted that he has a lot of pictorial and video content in this matter and will only post if the girls agree to it.The screenshots of the fourth girl are not available but she approached one of the other three girls on Instagram to let her know that Imam-ul-Haq cheats and the pictures of the chat have also been leaked. While Imam has certainly earned fame with his batting since making his international debut, this matter is likely to put him in trouble.Moreover, it also remains to be seen if the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) takes any action over the same. If the board decides to act based on these screenshots and tweets, the left-hander might have to face some tough time in the near future.Tweet 1:Tweet 2:Tweet 3:Tweet 4:Tweet 5:Tweet 6:",https://www.crictracker.com/imam-ul-haq-in-metoo-controversy-as-a-twitter-user-exposes-his-chats-with-girls/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

558,Priti Patel becomes Britain's 1st Indian-origin Home Secretary,"Priti Patel on Wednesday took charge as Britain's first Indian-origin Home Secretary in the newly unveiled Boris Johnson-led Cabinet. The 47-year-old has replaced Pakistani-origin Sajid Javid, who has been moved to the Treasury department as the first ethnic minority Chancellor of the Exchequer. Patel previously served as Secretary of State for International Development, but was forced to resign in 2017.",The Financial Express,"Priti Patel, an ardent Brexiteer who was among the most vocal critics of Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, took charge as Britain’s first Indian-origin home secretary as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s top team on Thursday.She replaces Pakistani-origin Sajid Javid, who moves to the Treasury department as the first ethnic minority Chancellor of the Exchequer.“I will do everything in my power to keep our country safe, our people secure, and also to fight the scourge of crime that we see on our streets. I look forward to the challenges that now lie ahead,” Patel said, in reference to her new job at the helm of the UK Home Office.Patel had been a prominent member of the “Back Boris” campaign for the Conservative Party leadership and was widely tipped for the plum post in the prime minister’s frontline team.“It is important that the cabinet should represent modern Britain as well as a modern Conservative Party,” she said, hours before her appointment was announced on Wednesday.A long-standing Eurosceptic, Patel had steered the “Vote Leave” campaign in the lead-up to the June, 2016 referendum in favour of Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU).The 47-year-old was first elected as a Conservative MP for Witham in Essex in 2010 and gained prominence in the then David Cameron-led Tory government as his Indian Diaspora Champion.She went on to be appointed to junior ministerial posts, treasury minister in 2014 and then employment minister after the 2015 general election, before May promoted her to the position of secretary of state in the Department for International Development (DfID) in 2016, until she was forced to quit the post in 2017.“With Boris Johnson leading the Conservative Party and as prime minister, the United Kingdom will have a leader who believes in Britain, will implement a new vision for the future of the country and a roadmap to move forward and thrive as a self-governing nation that re-establishes our ties with our friends and allies around the world such as India,” Patel told PTI after Johnson secured a landslide victory in the Tory leadership contest earlier this week.“He is committed to securing new and improved trading relationship with our friends in India and ensuring that the values we share — the rule of law, democracy, and dynamic entrepreneurial spirit — should be at the heart of one of our most important partners on the global stage,” Patel, who has been a champion of India-UK ties ever since her time as Indian Diaspora Champion, said.The Gujarati-origin politician, who is a prominent guest at all major Indian diaspora events in the UK, is seen as an avid supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the UK.As a member of the UK Parliament’s influential Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), she was part of the team that recently released its damning report warning that the UK was falling behind in the race to engage with India at the end of a lengthy Global Britain and India parliamentary inquiry.“Our report calls for the government to look again at the relationship between the UK and India,” Patel said, in reference to the “Building Bridges: Reawakening UK-India ties” report released last month to mark the first-ever India Day in the UK Parliament.“This should be a special relationship based upon the living bridge between our two great countries and a partnership we should be nurturing. The report covers many of the missed opportunities where the UK should be proactively and bilaterally enhancing our ties. We are soon to have a new PM in the UK, which will provide a welcome change in how we engage with India’s re-elected PM Modi,” she said at the time.Patel once again returns as the seniormost British Indian member of the UK cabinet, having been forced to resign in November, 2017 as International Development secretary amid a scandal over allegedly failing to disclose meetings with officials in Israel without informing the UK Foreign Office.She had maintained that it was a private visit and Johnson, then the UK foreign secretary, spoke out to back her.Describing Patel as a “good friend” with whom he worked closely together for Global Britain, he had said it was “quite right that she meets with people and organisations overseas”.But Patel was effectively sacked by May, forcing her to the Parliament backbenches, from where she continued to voice her criticism of May’s Brexit plan.She was among the rebel Tory MPs who consistently voted against the former prime minister’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU as a “bad deal for Britain”, which ultimately sealed May’s term at the top post.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

She underwent surgery in 2013 to repair the slipped disks on her lower back at a hospital. She said University Medicine Faculty's Forensic Medicine department found a nine-centimetre-long metal item in her lower back.,Times Now,"Denizli, Turkey: A woman is able to stick a magnet to her back after surgeons allegedly left a metal object inside her six years ago. Since the operation, the woman has attempted to prove it by sticking a magnet on her back.Sevgi Sulleri underwent surgery in June 2013 to repair the slipped disks on her lower back at a private hospital in Denizli. The operation which was supposed to give her relief from the back pain worsened the situation.Sulleri started having difficulties in standing for a long time. She was not even able to take care of her children due to the pain.""I couldn't take proper care of my children due to the pain. I moved to my mother's house and she started taking care of me,"" she told local media.When she went to the same hospital, they conducted an X-ray and told her that the pain was due to the stitches.However, when she watched a TV report about patients who have surgical items left accidentally inside them on the operation table. This is when Sulleri started to question some bizarre happenings with her since the operation.""When I was passing through the metal detectors, even though I didn't have any metal object on me, they were beeping. I came back one day home, took a magnet and put it on my back. I realised the magnet stood there,"" she added.""I was confused. Then I went back to the hospital where I had the surgery. I told my doctor that I had a metal item in my back and he admitted it was true.""The woman visited the University Medicine Faculty's Forensic Medicine department for another examination where she found out that there was a metal item in her lower back. The doctors prepared a report for her case as she is seeking justice through legal procedures.

Later she didn't have contact with me. I didn't conduct the surgery.

575,WC loss difficult to digest as we didn't make many mistakes: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli has said that 2019 World Cup semi-final defeat is very difficult to digest as Team India didn't make many mistakes to be knocked out. He added that acceptance becomes difficult as New Zealand outplayed them. ""The worst setbacks have not only motivated me but also improved me as a person,"" he further said about the defeat.",CricTracker,"Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni had given India a ray of hope with their century partnership in the semi-final against New Zealand. But with both of them getting out with the target only a few runs away, India’s dream of winning the World Cup shattered. The wonderful campaign ended when nobody saw it coming and there were some grim faces in the Indian dressing room. Even Virat Kohli was left distraught after the loss but he credited the opposition for outplaying the Men in Blue.The journey has once again begun now with India set to tour West Indies for the 3 T20Is, as many ODIs and a couple of Test matches. But the loss is still stinging some of the players and of course, the fans. However, the Indian captain Kohli feels that the team should be proud of itself for the way they played throughout the tournament.AdvertisementIndia topped the points table in the league stage and not many had given New Zealand a chance to beat them. But the BlackCaps, like they always do, punched above their weight and stunningly defended 239 runs in the crunch game.“What we have spoken to the team is that you should be proud of the way you have played and must never forget that. The moment you start taking credit away from what you’ve done, you start putting unnecessary pressure on yourself. The important thing is to be humble about what you do, but at the same time, don’t beat yourself up to the extent that you lose your admiration. That balance is very important,” Virat Kohli said while speaking to the Times of India.However, even the 30-year-old admitted that it hurt after India were knocked out of the tournament after playing so well throughout the World Cup. he was of the opinion that the team believed in achieving special things for the country but New Zealand outplayed them and it was a tough pill to swallow.“When your belief is right up there and everyone’s playing so well, and suddenly, you know, you’ve been outplayed. It’s very difficult to digest because you know you didn’t make many mistakes to be knocked out. When you make mistakes, you can point them out and take ownership of that, but when you have been outplayed, then the acceptance becomes difficult. You wake up and think you didn’t do much wrong, but we are still out,” Kohli further added.",https://www.crictracker.com/virat-kohli-opens-up-on-his-feelings-after-losing-the-world-cup-semi-final/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani had introduced the bill in the Rajya Sabha.,PTI,"New Delhi, Jul 24 (PTI) The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
passed a bill entailing amendments to the POCSO Act by
including death penalty for aggravated sexual assault on
children, besides providing stringent punishments for other
crimes against minors.The bill would now be send to the Lok Sabha for approval.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences
(Amendment) Bill, 2019 also provides for fines and
imprisonment to curb child pornography.While, replying to the debate, Union Women and Child
Development Minister Smriti Irani said the government is
setting up 1,023 fast track courts, which would specially deal
withe POCSO related cases.""Recognising that justice delayed is justice denied ,the
government has sanctioned 1023 fast track courts, particularly
to be made for dispensing cases which were pending under
POCSO, she added.The minister also spoke on the growing number of such
cases and lauded the support from members cutting across
party lines.""What we touch today is just a tip of the iceberg as many
cases are swept under the carpets,"" she said while referring
to the AITC member Derek O' Brien comments that ""many cases
are not spoken about as the perpetrator happens to be known to
the victim and happens to be a part of the victim's family.""
During the debate on the bill in the upper house, Brien
had recalled his childhood trauma of being molested in a bus.The government also took note of pending cases in various
high courts and said that 1.66 lakh cases relating to sexual
assaults were pending across the country at several stages.""The government reached out to each state and 18 states
has consented to set up this court,"" said Irani.""We have ensured that an expenditure of Rs 767 crore of

now given so that these fast track courts are established
within the limited time frame of 2019-2021,"" Irani said adding
that it reflects the priority of the government.  Besides, the government would also supervise the process
and have meeting with the Registrar General of every high
court to supervise the progress made in setting up such
courts.""We are also going to ensure that from every quarter from
the Registrar General of every high court, we look at the
progress made including the utilisation of funds and these
report would be shared with the Ministry of Law & Justice, MHA

(NCPCR) and the state governments have been asked to appoint a
senior nodal police officer for their state level Commission
for Protection of Child Rights.""Now this same has been complied by all state
governments,"" Irani said adding the data of victims is also
being refined as per their genders to give better support and
rehabilitation process.Besides, the government would also monitor the pendency
of such cases at local police level at the investigation level
as it has to be completed within a time frame.A National data base of sexual offenders has also been
launched by MHA last year and contains data of 6.20 lakh
sexual offenders in the country. The data helps when such
person goes for employment and the institution sends their
information for police verification.The government is also training the officials in forensic
science for investigation in such sexual assault cases.When a member sought to know the description of
penetrative sexual assault, the minister while apologising for
""being a bit crude"" said in some cases objects have been
inserted in children.Over the death penalty, she said that it was just a
option given under the amendments to the bill.""The punishment now goes to 20 years till the entire life
and death as deemed fit by the court, given that the court
wisely uses these kind of descriptive punishments,"" Irani said
adding ""We can rely on the wisdom of the courts to use death
penalty in rare of the rarest case.""
Over the specific time line, she said that entire trial
has to be completed within one year and investigation has to
be completed within two months from filing of FIR.The bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday by
Irani.While participating in the debate Vandan Chavan of NCP
said that there is a need for child friendly courts and
identity of the victim should not be revealed.Rajaram of BSP said that the law needs a stricter
implementation and said that mastermind of the crime should
also be equally punished along with the main offenders.Shushil Kr Gupta of AAP, Vijaysai Reddy YSRCP, Binoy

Centre had imposed duty on newsprint, uncoated paper used for newspapers and lightweight coated paper for magazines.",The Financial Express,"Rejecting demands for rollback of import duty on the paper used for printing newspapers, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said 10 per cent customs duty on imported newsprint was a move to provide a level playing field for domestic manufacturers. Replying to the debate on Finance Bill 2019, which contained the tax proposal, in the Rajya Sabha, she said domestic newsprint manufacturers were finding it difficult to find buyers because the same was being imported.“Basic Customs Duty on newsprint has been increased to provide a level playing field to domestic manufacturers. There is a capacity in this country to produce newsprint. But unfortunately, they are not able to get buyers because most of the newsprint is imported,” she said.In the last few months, there has been a drastic fall in price overseas from USD 700 per tonne to USD 500 per tonne, she said, adding that kind of fall in global newsprint prices has affected the Indian manufacturers so badly that they are not able to find takers for their product.“So if we are talking of Make in India but allowing indirectly to import, it does not make sense at all. I am sure the member appreciate this point that when we are trying to make Indian industry survive this kind of onslaught, this is inevitable,” she said.Sitharaman was responding to YSR-Congress leader V Vijayasai Reddy, who during the debate stated that the duty would adversely impact small newspapers at a time when advertising revenue was also depleting. “You cannot allow fall in international price adversely affecting when we have capacities. If we did not have capacities, I can fully understand. I want members to please appreciate,” the minister said.“I also want to say newsprint attracted basic customs duty even before 2009. We are not the first ones to put it here,” she added.Earlier this month, the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) asked the government to withdraw the 10 per cent customs duty imposed on newsprint, the uncoated paper used for printing of newspapers, and lightweight coated papers used for magazines. “Publishers of newspapers and magazines are already reeling under severe financial pressure due to many factors like lower advertisement revenues, higher costs and digital onslaught from technological giants. Small and medium newspapers will go into deeper losses and many of them will be forced to close down,” it had said.India’s newsprint consumption is around 2.5 million tonnes per annum while the domestic industry’s manufacturing capacity is only 1 million tonnes.

605,"US fines FB $5bn, Zuckerberg to lose sole control on privacy decisions","Facebook will pay a record $5 billion fine to settle a government probe into its privacy practices, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said today. Under the settlement, Facebook's board will create an independent privacy committee that removes ""unfettered control by CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions affecting user privacy"". The investigation relates to Cambridge Analytica scandal and other privacy breaches.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to resolve a government probe into its privacy practices and will boost safeguards on user data, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the social media company said on Wednesday. After the stock market closed, Facebook disclosed as a part of its earnings report that the FTC told it last month that the commission had opened a separate antitrust investigation of the company. The FTC, which early in the day issued a statement and held a press conference about the privacy settlement, did not mention an antitrust probe. The FTC probe that resulted in the $5 billion settlement uncovered a wide range of privacy issues. It was triggered last year by allegations that Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree by inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The consultancy’s clients included President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign.  The FTC voted 3-2 to adopt the settlement, which the three Republican commissioners called the settlement “a complete home run” that exceeded any possible court award. Both Democratic commissioners said it did not go far enough or require a large enough fine. The settlement requires court approval. Republican FTC Chairman Joe Simons stressed the FTC’s limited authority and desire to avoid a long court fight. “Would it have been nice to get more, to get $10 billion, instead of $5 billion for example, to get greater restrictions on how Facebook collects uses and shares data?” he asked at a press conference. “We did not have those options. We cannot impose such things by our own fiat.” Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra complained that the penalty provided “blanket immunity” for Facebook executives “and no real restraints on Facebook’s business model” and does “not fix the core problems that led to these violations” or limit Facebook’s ability to collect data. Facebook confirmed it would pay the $5 billion fine and said the settlement would provide “a comprehensive new framework for protecting people’s privacy.” Its shares closed about 1% higher. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Facebook agreed to pay an additional $100 million to settle allegations that it misled investors about the seriousness of its misuse of users’ data. Under the settlement, Facebook’s board will create an independent privacy committee that removes “unfettered control by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions affecting user privacy.” Facebook also agreed to exercise greater oversight over third-party apps, and said it was ending access to friend data for Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp.  The Republican FTC majority said the settlement “significantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg’s power — something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished.” Under the deal, Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives must sign quarterly certifications attesting to privacy practices. The FTC said a false certification could result in civil and criminal penalties.    Facebook also is barred from asking for email passwords to other services when consumers sign up. It is barred from using telephone numbers for advertising if they are obtained in a security feature like two-factor authentication. The company must also get user consent to use facial recognition data.  Facebook said it may find additional problems as it initiates a review of its systems and warned it will take longer to roll out updates. In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said” “we’re bringing our privacy controls more in line with our financial controls.” He added that when features are added or modified, “we’ll have to document any risks and the steps we’re taking to mitigate them.” The FTC also said that Cambridge Analytica’s former CEO Alexander Nix and former app developer Aleksandr Kogan had agreed to a settlement restricting how they conduct business. Several lawmakers criticized the settlement. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called it “a fig leaf” that offers “no accountability for top executives.” “By relying on a monetary fine to deter Facebook, the FTC has failed to heed history’s lessons. Facebook has already written this penalty down as a one-time-cost in return for the extraordinary profits reaped from a decade of data misuse,” said Blumenthal, a Democrat. Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the deal, saying it “does nothing to hold executives accountable. It utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way.” Facebook confirmed that marketing vice president Michel Protti had been nominated to be chief privacy officer for product but under the settlement he must be approved by the new board committee overseeing privacy. Other legal issues loom. On Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. The department did not specify Facebook or any other company but cited concerns raised about “search, social media, and some retail services online.” Leaders in those areas include Google parent Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook and possibly Apple Inc.  The Democrats on the FTC complained that the $5 billion penalty may be less than Facebook’s gains from violating users’ privacy. “Until we address Facebook’s core financial incentives for risking our personal privacy and national security, we will not be able to prevent these problems from happening again,” Chopra said. The other Democratic commissioner, Rebecca Slaughter, said the FTC should have taken Facebook and Zuckerberg to court.

Saeed’s arrest came just ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Imran Khan and was widely seen as a move by the Islamabad government to smoothe the way before a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. The United States has offered a reward of $10 million for information leading to the conviction of Saeed, who has been arrested and released several times over the past decade. On Wednesday, an anti-terrorism court in Gujranwala, near the eastern city of Lahore, remanded Saeed to custody for 14 days while counter-terrorism officials complete investigations, the lawyer, Imran Fazal, said. U.S. officials have long pressured Pakistan to try Saeed, who is designated a terrorist by the United States and the United Nations. He is the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or the Army of the Pure, a militant group blamed by the United States and India for the attacks that killed more than 160 people. He has denied any involvement and said his network, which spans 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services, has no ties to militant groups.

In Budget 2019-20, she had announced the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 25% for firms with up to â‚¹400 crore annual turnover, covering 99.3% companies. She said, ""Hardly any are left behind...We shall cover them sooner.""",Times Now,"New Delhi: It is welcome news that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is likely to bring down the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent for all companies. In her maiden budget, FM Sitharaman chose to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent from 30 per cent for companies with a turnover of up to Rs 400 crore, mentioning that this would cover 99.3 per cent of enterprises.In her reply to the discussion on the appropriation and finance bills in the Rajya Sabha, Sitharaman said: “We brought it down in order that now 99.3 per cent of all industries are covered by the 25 per cent rate. Therefore, hardly any are left behind… We shall cover them sooner.”The finance minister mentioned that this was a pledge that had been given in the maiden budget of the first Narendra Modi government in 2014 and it had to be honoured. In February 2015, the then finance minister Arun Jaitley, in his second budget, had announced lowering of the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent from 30 per cent in a phased manner over the next four years.Sitharaman went on to add that the commitment that corporate tax rate would be brought down has been kept. She pointed out that the budget tax proposals aimed at redistribution of funds to bring more equitable development. Parliament on Tuesday approved the Narendra Modi-2.0 government’s debut budget.Justifying the tax hike on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre each, the finance minister said inflation is fairly benign and the move would not create any considerable burden on prices. The proposals, including increasing the surcharge on the super-rich and levy of a tax on high-value cash withdrawals were basically aimed at creating the new India and curbing tax evasion as well as black money, the finance minister explained.“So, if you were to raise more taxes, more collection is only going to result in more re-distribution of funds thereby bringing far more equitable development,” Sitharaman mentioned.On the levy of two per cent TDS (tax deducted at source) if aggregate cash withdrawal from one or more accounts exceeds Rs 1 crore, Sitharaman said this will not be over and above the tax liability of the individual or the entity and can be set off when returns are filed.The total TDS paid on cash withdrawal beyond Rs 1 crore will be adjusted against the total tax dues of the taxpayer and would not be constituted as income in the hands of the taxpayer. This provision would come into effect from September 1, 2019. Many analysts say the finance ministry imposed the levy in an earnest attempt to crack down on tax evasion and check the generation of black money.Sitharaman also clarified that the report on Direct Tax Code would be submitted on July 31 and the Centre was keen to lower tax compliance burden on taxpayers.",https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/economy/article/all-companies-may-come-under-25-tax-bracket-soon-hints-fm-sitharaman/458276?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Luckystar also sought pending rental dues for April and May from Jet.",The Financial Express,"The owner of Jet Airways headquarters in Mumbai has moved NCLT, asking for the removal of Jet Airways’ Resolution Professional from the premises of HQ Siroya House, according to some media reports. Since the airline has not paid dues after the month of March, the license for space occupancy has been terminated, Luckystar Property Holdings, the legal owner of the premises, Siroya, told the Mumbai bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The license was terminated early in June as Jet Airways defaulted on payments for April and May, the media reports said. Jet Airways had temporarily suspended its operation on April 17. Grant Thornton’s Ashish Chhawchharia was appointed the RP for Jet Airways’ IBC proceedings. The legal counsel of Luckystar alleged that Chhawchharia took possession of the property as if it belonged to the grounded airline. Janak Dwarkadas, senior counsel of Luckystar property, also argued that the Resolution Professional does not possess any right on the property which is not owned by debtor Jet Airways but by someone else, the media reports said. On RP’s part, it had cited the NCLT order, which granted a moratorium on Jet’s assets after the company was admitted into the insolvency proceedings late in June. Citing law, Dwarkadas added that a property’s possession belongs to a licensor and the licensee has only juridical possession till the time mentioned in any agreement. The Mumbai bench of NCLT has adjourned the matter to August 8. Naresh Goyal-founded Jet Airways was moved to NCLT after the consortium of lenders led by The State Bank of India dragged the beleaguered airline for insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

638,Russia expressed deep regret for airspace intrusion: South Korea,"A Russian official has expressed ""deep regret"" after one of the country's military aircraft intruded into South Korean airspace, South Korea's presidential office said. The Russian official added that the intrusion was not intentional and blamed a device malfunction for the incident. The Russian military aircraft had entered airspace over an island claimed by both South Korea and Japan.",Reuters,"MOSCOW/SEOUL (Reuters) - Russia’s embassy in Seoul on Wednesday said that Moscow had not apologised for an alleged airspace violation the previous day, after South Korea said that a Russian attache had expressed “deep regret” and blamed malfunctioning equipment. A Russian military aircraft entered airspace near a group of islets claimed by both South Korea and Japan on Tuesday, during a long-range joint air patrol with Chinese jets, according to South Korea and Japan, which both scrambled fighter jets in response. South Korean warplanes fired flares and hundreds of warning shots near the Russian aircraft, and the incident triggered a round of diplomatic protests by countries in the region.  An unidentified Russian military attache in Seoul told South Korean officials on Tuesday that the plane appeared to have “entered an unplanned area due to a device malfunction”, said Yoon Do-han, South Korea’s presidential press secretary. “Russia has conveyed its deep regret over the incident and said its defence ministry would immediately launch an investigation and take all necessary steps,” Yoon said. “The officer said such a situation would have never occurred if it followed the initially planned route.” Hours later, Russia’s embassy in Seoul said there had been no apology.  “The Russian side did not make an official apology,” the embassy in Seoul said, adding it had noted many inaccuracies in the comments by South Korea, Interfax reported. The incident comes at a delicate time for a region that has for years been overshadowed by hostility between the United States and North Korea and has recently seen a flare-up in tension between South Korea and Japan. Russia’s public statements on the issue have not mentioned any technical problems, nor has Russia announced any investigation or acknowledged a violation of South Korean airspace. Yoon said in a later briefing that after the attache admitted a possible mistake and expressed regret, which was taken as Moscow’s official position, Russia “altered” its account by sending a document stating that it did not violate any airspace. Russia also accused South Korean fighter jets of threatening the safety of Russian aircraft by interfering with their flight and failing to communicate, Yoon said.  Seoul’s defence ministry said Russia was “distorting the truth” and it had evidence to support its claim.  Russia’s Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request to clarify the conflicting accounts.  “The document says that they might take a responsive measure if similar flights by the South Korean Air Force recur,” Yoon said.  An official at the defence ministry earlier told reporters it believed the intrusion could not have resulted from a system error.  He did not elaborate, but another official told Reuters that the two countries plan to hold working-level talks on Thursday in Seoul to clarify what happened. While troops and naval ships from Russia and China have taken part in joint war games before, they have not conducted such air patrols in the Asia-Pacific region together, according to Russia’s Ministry of Defence.  China’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that China and Russia did not enter the airspace of any other country during their joint patrols on Tuesday. South Korea and Japan scrambled fighter jets because both claim sovereignty over the disputed islets, called Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan.  The two U.S. allies are mired in a deepening political and trade dispute, which fanned concerns that it might undercut three-way security cooperation to fend off North Korea’s nuclear threats.  The incident also coincided with the visit of U.S. national security adviser John Bolton to South Korea.  Bolton and his counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, discussed the suspected airspace breach during a meeting on Wednesday and vowed close consultations in case of more such incidents, South Korea’s presidential Blue House said in a statement.

641,29-yr-old postpones $4.5 mn lunch with Buffett due to kidney stones,"Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun postponed his $4.57 million charity lunch with Warren Buffett after falling ill with kidney stones. The 29-year-old, who founded Tron cryptocurrency, denied reports that he was involved in illegal fundraising and money laundering. Sun added a report by a Chinese publication stating he had been barred from leaving the country was ""completely false"".",Reuters,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun postponed his $4.57 million charity lunch with Warren Buffett after falling ill with kidney stones, according to a statement from a foundation he backs. Sun had been scheduled to dine with Buffett on July 25 at the Michelin-starred Quince restaurant in San Francisco after he won an auction to benefit Glide, a charity in the city.  Sun’s Tron Foundation said all parties have agreed to reschedule the lunch. Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), has long been a skeptic of cryptocurrency. He once called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” and at Berkshire’s annual meeting in May likened wagering on bitcoin to betting on zero or double-zero on a Las Vegasroulette wheel. Sun had said that he hoped dining with Buffett would “bridge the gap between institutional and traditional investors and the realm of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.”    Buffett has raised about $34.2 million for Glide, a charity that serves the poor, homeless and those battling substance abuse, in 20 annual auctions since 2000. Glide said on Tuesday it has received Sun’s entire donation. Sun on Tuesday denied a Chinese media report suggesting he engaged in improper activities in China. He wrote on his Weibo social media account that rumors circulating online about illegal fundraising and about money laundering were untrue, and that Singapore-based Tron complied with local laws there. Later on Wednesday, he said a report by Chinese financial magazine Caixin, stating he had been barred from foreign travel by Chinese authorities, was “completely false”. Tron launched its TRX token in 2017, raising about $70 million in an initial coin offering, and acquired San Francisco-based BitTorrent for $120 million last year. It has said its goal is to establish a decentralized internet. Tron’s cryptocurrency was down 11.2% on Tuesday afternoon, according to the website CoinMarketCap.com, giving it a value of about $1.68 billion.

675,Fintech startup Zeta gets funding from Sodexo at $300M valuation,"Bengaluru-based fintech startup Zeta has raised reportedly about $60 million in a Series C funding round at a valuation of around $300 million from French food services and facilities management company Sodexo. This marked the startup's first-ever external funding. Zeta has been funded by Co-founders Bhavin Turakhia and Ramki Gaddipati, who have collectively invested $40 million to date.",TechCrunch,"Startups looking to expand the reach of financial services continue to receive a nod from investors. Zeta, a fintech firm that runs a full stack neo-banking platform and offers enterprise payments solutions, said today its valuation reached $300 million in its maiden outside funding.Sodexo  BRS funded Zeta’s Series C round to take a minority stake in the company. Zeta  executives declined to reveal the size of the funding, but a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch the amount was less than $60 million.This is the first time Zeta — or its CEO and co-founder Bhavin Turakhia — has raised money from an outside party, he told TechCrunch in an interview.Turakhia, 39, has co-founded a number of web companies over the years, which he sold for $160 million in 2014, and team collaboration and productivity app Flock. Flock too has not raised any outside capital to date.Zeta operates in Asia and Latin America and counts as its potential clients companies and banks looking to bring retail and corporate fintech products. Its full stack cloud-native neo-banking platform supports issuance of credit, debit and prepaid products. Its enterprise solutions features support for TnE cards, P-cards, expense management, salary disbursement and corporate gifting.The firm has already amassed over 2 million users, and three different banks and financial institutions, including Sodexo, that use Zeta’s platform, and more than 14,000 corporate clients, including Amazon . Multiple banks in India are using Zeta’s corporate gifting service.The new capital will be used to expand the company’s business in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and Southeast Asia, Turakhia and Ramki Gaddipati, the startup’s CTO and co-founder, told TechCrunch in an interview. It has already signed contracts with many partners to facilitate the expansion in the next six months.The firm, which today employs about 450 people, also plans to grow its team and set up offices in many more places across the globe.“There hasn’t been many zero to one innovations in the banking ecosystem in the last 20 years,” said Turakhia. “If you look at the banking space, it has been dominated by licensed software from legacy organizations. Many of these companies still provide most of the stacks that run most of the payment systems around the world for banks and non-banks.”So like a growing number of companies, Zeta is betting that it is a pivotal time to disrupt this. “That was the genesis of starting Zeta, building a new and innovative technology stack that enables interesting use cases for banks and other bank-line financial institutions that want to issue credit, debit, or prepaid products and provide their customers with enhanced functionalities,” he said.And that opportunity is what led Turakhia to seek outside capital, he said. “In the next five to seven years, I want to make Zeta 20 to 30 times bigger than any exit I have ever had,” he said.Additionally, Zeta also saw value that Sodexo, which operates globally, could bring to its platform.In a statement, Aurelien Sonet, CEO, BRS at Sodexo, said, “Sodexo has been a strategic partner of Zeta since 2017. This investment will enable the Sodexo group to benefit from Zeta’s comprehensive suite of solutions and offer a seamless payment experience to our consumers. Zeta and Sodexo are already working together on deploying Zeta’s platform across several Sodexo subsidiaries across different regions.”",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/zeta-300m-sodexo/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

710,I am the happiest person in the world: Karnataka CM after govt falls,"Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, while he was on his way to submit resignation to Governor Vajubhai Vala, told reporters that he is ""totally relieved now"". ""I am the happiest person in the world now,"" he added. Kumaraswamy resigned shortly after the ruling Congress-JD(S) coalition lost the confidence vote by a margin of six votes in the 225-member state assembly.",The News Minute,"After days of drama, closed-door negotiations and unsuccessful attempts to pacify rebelling MLAs, Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy submitted his resignation to the Governor, about an hour after he lost the Trust Vote in the Assembly. With this, the 13-month-old JD(S)-Congress government in the state has officially come to end.""I hereby tender my resignation to the post of Chief Minister of Karnataka along with my Cabinet and request you to kindly accept the same. I take this opportunity to extend my grateful thanks for the cooperation given to me and my colleagues during my tenure,"" Kumaraswamy said in his letter. The Governor accepted his resignation and asked him to continue as caretaker CM until further notice. Kumaraswamy’s resignation comes after the coalition lost the Trust Vote moved by the former CM himself in the state Assembly. Kumaraswamy managed to get just 99 votes, versus 105 against him. The coalition's multiple efforts to stall the Trust Vote and bring back the rebel MLAs to their fold ended in the embarassing defeat on the floor of the House on Tuesday evening. With the rebel MLAs showing no signs of returning to the coalition and the Speaker unable to delay the trust vote any further, Tuesday evening saw Kumaraswamy going over to the Raj Bhavan around 8.30 pm and giving in his resignation.While the Congress and JD(S) had formed a sudden coalition in May 2018 and snatched away BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa's dream of becoming CM again, a year later, things have come a full circle, as Yeddyurappa and the BJP have clearly aided much of the rebellion, though they continue to deny any involvement.The politics in Karnataka, which has been unravelling since July 6, has seen all ministers in Kumaraswamy’s cabinet resign to make way for rebelling MLAs, but to no avail. Attempts by Congress’ troubleshooter and former minister DK Shivakumar to reach out to the MLAs, who were camped in a Mumbai hotel, also failed, with the leader even being detained by the police. The end of the road, however, came when more MLAs tendered their resignations and the Supreme Court allowing the rebelling legislators to sit out of the Assembly proceedings. The crisis for the coalition began on July 6 when 12 Congress and JD(S) MLAs submitted their resignations to the Speaker’s office. Just days before that Congress MLA Anand Singh had also tendered his resignation. The disgruntled MLAs accused Kumaraswamy of inefficiency and not taking into confidence the requests put forth by his fellow legislators.Though the coalition has accused the BJP of orchestrating the rebellion and provided proof to support their allegations, the dissent within the coalition, that had been brewing for months, has eventually lead to its collapse. With the fall of the Kumaraswamy government, the floor is now open for BS Yeddyurappa to stake claim. Alternatively, he can wait for bye-elections to be completed and then make a move to form the next government. Karnataka remains a state that has seen only four stable governments that completed its term. ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hd-kumaraswamy-resigns-chief-minister-karnataka-after-losing-trust-vote-105987?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

We are with you,"" Digvijaya tweeted. Since Rahul Gandhi's resignation on July 3, 2019, taking responsibility for the party's drubbing in the Lok Sabha Elections, the party is without a chief.  Elections in two states - Haryana and Maharashtra - are scheduled this year, while two states are set to go to polls in the early months next year.  However, the party seems to be in disarray with no clarity on when the new leadership will be elected. While Rahul Gandhi has asserted that a non-Gandhi should be the next chief, several senior leaders have stressed that a non-Gandhi at the helm will lead to split in the party. Recently, Natwar Singh endorsed ) Priyanka Gandhi’s name for the post saying that the party will split within 24 hours if a non-Gandhi is elected as its chief.Earlier, Mani Shankar Aiyar had said that a ‘non-Gandhi’ can be party chief, but the Gandhi family must remain active within the organisation.As for Priyanka Gandhi, her recent standoff with the Uttar Pradesh government stirred memories of July 1977 when Indira Gandhi emerged as the messiah of the oppressed class when she visited Bihar's Belchi village in the aftermath of a bloody massacre where 11 Dalits were killed. Priyanka seems to be heading towards a similar path, however, whether she'll be able to bring the grand old party alive, remains to be seen.

""I am willing to order food from a hotel, eat and continue,"" Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar said. Eventually, the Assembly was adjourned at 11:30 pm.",The News Minute,"It seemed that the JD(S)-Congress MLAs were out of ideas to delay the trust vote in the Karnataka Assembly session on Monday until Opposition Leader BS Yeddyurappa inadvertently offered a new lease. It was past 10.30 pm and there seemed no end in sight for the session that had begun at 11 am. Any chance of decorum and sensible debate had almost flown out the window when Yeddyurappa raised a crucial question: “Honourable Speaker, can we adjourn for dinner and reconvene? We are willing to wait as long as possible for the trust vote to happen today (Monday) at any cost.”The legislators of the JDS(S)-Congress coalition wasted no time jumping on the excuse. They weren't just hungry. They were hangry. “Yes, yes. Let’s adjourn for dinner and go home. We are all very hungry,” Congress and JD(S) MLAs, who were already in the well of the House, began yelling.A visibly miffed Speaker sat with his head in its hands. Yeddyurappa munched on cashews nuts to satiate his appetite. The Karnataka Assembly session on Monday, which had convened to debate and vote on the motion of confidence, had dragged on for way too long. The deciding trust vote that could make or break the coalition would have to wait another day — dinnertime beckoned, the MLAs argued. But food wasn't a good enough reason to satisfy everyone. Unwilling to budge, BJP MLA from Tumkur, JC Madhuswamy, stood up and yelled, “It's OK honourable Speaker, we are willing to stay here till midnight, with or without food.” Silence fell upon the House as Madhuswamy’s statement swept across the room. 'Without food' was not an option that the hungry legislators seemed willing to entertain. Chaos fueled by hanger soon erupted in the house. Intervening on behalf of the MLAs creating a ruckus, Large Scale Industries Minister KJ George said, ""Let's adjourn for dinner and reconvene tomorrow (Tuesday). We are all hungry and we can go home, sleep and start fresh in the morning. A lot of our MLAs still have to speak. We can’t finish this today.""Leaders of the ruling coalition had been playing a game of one-upmanship with the Opposition – Who will win in the game of delaying the trust vote? The MLAs of the coalition have waxed lyrical about the opposition’s greed for power and their alleged involvement in the horsetrading of MLAs for the last five days. Each and every legislator, who spoke in the Assembly has said the same thing, over and over again, albeit in different words -- The BJP's involvement in the horse-trading of MLAs and the party's hand in crippling democracy and assaulting the Constitution. The issue had reached its peak on Monday. From the Opposition and the Speaker to the marshals guarding the doors of the Assembly, everyone wanted the issue to be put to rest. “When can we go home? Is this ever going to end? We are hungry, too,” a marshal said. The delaying tactic was getting under the Speaker’s skin. The clock struck 11 pm and yet he refused to budge.""I am willing to order food from a hotel, eat and continue,” Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar said as he ordered decorum in the house. Another bout of sloganeering and shouting began with Congress and JD(S) MLAs shouting. ""We are hungry, adjourn the house so we can reconvene tomorrow.""It became apparent that the coalition’s MLAs had irritated the Speaker beyond words when Periyapatna MLA Shivalinge Gowda said, “I am diabetic. I don’t have the energy to continue. Please let us go home. Yeddyurappa sir, you are diabetic, too. Please let us adjourn.” Soon, toffees and chocolates were distributed for those who had diabetes and the chaos continued.Holding his head in his hand, a defeated Speaker finally caved to pressure. The sambar rice he had ordered for the MLAs had arrived and a mad rush for dinner ensued. The Assembly was adjourned at 11.30 pm. MLAs, journalists, marshals and bureaucrats, who were still at Vidhana Soudha, began rushing out, hoping for a meal, when one of the marshals announced, “The food is over.”",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/were-hungry-karnataka-mlas-latest-excuse-delay-trust-vote-105946?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

But...Who had started this?"" ""For the last 70 years, we (Muslims) have been hearing either 'go to kabristan (grave)' or 'go to Pakistan'. Who is responsible for it?"" he asked.",Times Now,"Kairana: Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Monday shocked yet again with his communal and divisive comment. The Rampur MP reiterated that Muslims were paying a price for choosing to stay in India after partition in 1947.While commenting on Kairana MLA Nahid Hasan’s appeal to Muslims to boycott the shopkeepers who support the BJP, Khan said: ""It is a sad thing that such a situation arose. But who is responsible for it? Who had started this? We (Muslims) stayed back, our ancestors stayed back in India.”""For the last 70 years, we have been hearing either 'go to kabristan (grave)' or 'go to Pakistan'. Who is responsible for it?"" asked Samajwadi MP and former Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan. The Samajwadi Party leader, who has been declared a 'land mafia' by the Yogi Adityanath government, added that prominent leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had appealed to Muslims to stay back but today, the community is being dealt with badly.""Bapu, Maulana Azad, Sardar Patel, Nehru ji asked us to stay back. The Muslims who were about to leave the country stayed back. Bapu had assured us that this nation is as much ours as it is anyone else's. But what is the treatment being meted out? We are told our place is either in the grave or in Pakistan,"" Khan said.Responding to Azam Khan’s statements, BJP leader Jagdambika Pal said: ""If the conditions were bad (in India), Azam Khan would not have been an MP. And he is just not an MP, he was a minister before this. It is possible only in India that he can run a private university.""""The condition in Pakistan is not a secret...Azam Khan is being able to speak freely because India ensures the freedom of speech and expression. I feel the way India has given security to its minorities, even the neighbouring countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh, or even Indonesia, and the South East nations do not give such kind of freedom,"" added Pal.Earlier today, Samajwadi Party MLA from Kairana in Uttar Pradesh's Shamli district, Nahid Hasan, was booked for purportedly asking people to not buy products from shops being run BJP supporters.The SP MLA has been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation to cause riot), 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief).",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/video-azam-khan-shocks-again-says-muslims-forced-to-choose-between-kabristan-ya-pakistan/457656?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
798,AI research lab OpenAI raises $1 billion from Microsoft,"San Francisco-based AI research lab OpenAI has raised $1 billion from Microsoft. ""Our ambition is to democratise AI, while always keeping AI safety front and centre, so everyone can benefit,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. OpenAI was Co-founded by Elon Musk in 2015, who left its board and daily operations in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla.",TechCrunch,"Microsoft  is making a $1 billion bet on OpenAI,  the company formed by notable founders including Elon Musk and Sam Altman  three years ago with the aim of doing research and development work to steer the growth of artificial intelligence toward the “friendlier” end of the spectrum, in order to help mitigate what Musk sees as a potential existential threat from AI if it isn’t developed responsibly while it grows in capability.On Monday, Microsoft and OpenAI announced a multiyear “exclusive computing partnership” that will include the two companies building new AI supercomputing technologies for Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, and OpenAI will also port its existing services to work on Azure . Microsoft will also now be “OpenAI’s preferred partner” when it comes to the commercialization of new AI technologies it develops in the future.All the talk of “exclusivity” and “preference” in this announcement is particularly interesting because one of OpenAI’s founding principles was to “freely collaborate” among other AI researchers, and make both its work and patents available to others. But there are some caveats, including that there is OpenAI Inc. the nonprofit organization, and its for-profit corporate subsidiary OpenAI LP, and that its current charter includes a provision that out of “safety and security concerns” it may reduce its public publishing of its work as it moves forward.The goal of this partnership for Microsoft seems to be to provide it an edge in building out a broad-scale Azure AI platform, and ensure its supercomputing technologies are involved in the development of artificial general intelligence. OpenAI benefits because Microsoft will be party to its principles around developing advances in AGI safely and with humanity’s interest in mind — and there’s the $1 billion, too.This $1 billion isn’t a lump-sum up-front investment — instead, it’s a total amount that can be delivered anytime over the next decade, in installments that correspond with funding efforts on OpenAI’s side that feed back into Microsoft’s own AI ambitions, as detailed by The New York Times.While the exact breakdown of the nature of the investment wasn’t made public, an account apparently belonging to CTO Greg Brockman  on HackerNews said that it was “a cash investment.”Update (11:30am PT): long after the press releases hit the wire at 6am this morning, OpenAI contacted us with a bit more detail about the announcement. Here is the statement we received from OpenAI co-founder and CTO Greg Brockman: “It’s a cash investment into OpenAI LP. It uses a standard capital commitment structure, to be called as we need it. We plan to spend it in less than five years, and possibly much sooner.”At its launch, OpenAI noted that it had $1 billion committed from Musk, Altman and co-founder Brockman, as well as Reid Hoffman,  Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services  (this makes the Azure angle here particularly interesting), Infosys and YC Research, though it did not anticipate spending that much in the ensuing few years.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
799,"OYO Founder to get $2-billion loan from Japan's Nomura, Mizuho","OYO Founder, 25-year-old Ritesh Agarwal, is receiving a $2-billion loan from three Japanese lenders including Nomura, Mizuho and an unknown bank, to purchase the Gurugram-based budget hospitality startup's shares. Agarwal is purchasing a $1.5-billion stake from early OYO investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia India. He will be investing the rest $500 million in the startup.",Entrackr,"It is as reported. Three Japan-based banks – Nomura, Mizuho, and one unidentified bank – are funding Ritesh Agarwal’s $2 billion loan, out of which $1.5 billion will be used for buyback of Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Lightspeed’s shares and $500 million for primary investment purposes.Nomura and Mizuho are the principal lenders in this deal.The money will go into the freshly formed Cayman-based RA Hospitality Holdings, devised specifically to facilitate this primary and secondary $2 billion transaction on behalf of Agarwal. It is not clear if there is any other stakeholder in this entity.As far as the loan is concerned, just as The Ken had reported, the financing has been done with Agarwal’s current 9% stake in OYO as collateral and the repayment is expected in three years,  right around the time when the India-headquartered hospitality chain plans to go IPO.With this transaction that marks the firm’s valuation at $10 billion, Agarwal’s stake is slated to increase to 30- 40%. At the time of IPO, the expected valuation of the firm is $18 billion, and that would entail Agarwal’s stake being worth at least $4.8 billion, which will then enable him to repay the loan with interest.Nomura, Mizuho have faith in the firm’s growth and are certain around the repayment as the international expansion is certain to add to the firm’s value. Case in point, both are also investing in OYO’s equity shares directly. Nomura has plans to invest $50 million in OYO by purchasing a part of SoftBank’s stake in the firm and this is the first investment the Bank directly makes in the Indian startup ecosystem. The financial company is looking to invest $500 million in equities of high growth companies in APAC, and it will do this via capital commitments from its proprietary books.Nomura’s direct investment in OYO through SoftBank’s shares is important, not only this provides a nominal exit to SoftBank – whose stake in OYO cannot go over 49.9% – and hence an opportunity to buy some shares again, in case the debt repayment faces any glitches; but it is also important because it strengthens the speculation that SoftBank is one of the major guiding forces behind this entire deal.Nomura and SoftBank have anyway been known to have worked together across history at several points. The financial company co-advised Yahoo-SoftBank deal along with Goldman Sachs. It was also the leading underwriter for 500 billion Yen bond sale by SoftBank in April. SoftBank’s mobile unit’s IPO last December was also supervised by Nomura. This leaves no doubt around the strong synergies between SoftBank and Nomura, and leaves no doubt around who is orchestrating the OYO-Agarwal deal from behind the curtains. In fact, Nomura is also going to play a “fee-generating role” in OYO’s IPO as per an ET report.Importantly, the 49.9% clause set after the recent $1 billion fund infusion by SoftBank in OYO to protect the firm’s image as an independent firm in the market and not lead to a potential direct takeover by SoftBank in the firm with another 20% stake acquisition. This clause can only be changed with the permission of Agarwal, Greenoaks, Lightspeed, and Sequoia. With Agarwal purchasing the partial stakes of all these investors for $1.5 billion and him being magnificently indebted to Nomura, Mizuho (read: SoftBank), there is no real entity stopping Masayoshi Son from controlling the operations and decisions to be taken for the Gurugram headquartered company.",https://entrackr.com/2019/07/nomura-mizuho-ritesh-agarwal-debt/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Despite call for withdrawal by experts, Facebook said a “technical error” was behind the problem in group chat. Facebook sent notification to parents, saying it has disabled the group chats in cases where the flaw was detected.“We recently notified some parents of Messenger Kids account users about a technical error that we detected affecting a small number of group chats,” a Facebook spokesperson was quoted as saying. “We turned off the affected chats and provided parents with additional resources on Messenger Kids and online safety,” the company added.Messenger Kids is a video chat and messaging app designed for kids to communicate with family and close friends that parents or caregivers approve.

The court sentenced the couple to two years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a â‚¹10,000 penalty on each of them. The mother had approached police in 2015, accusing her elder son in the case.",The News Minute,"In a rare judgement, a court in Telangana's Rangareddy district convicted a man and his wife for throwing his mother out of her house and threatening and insulting her. The  Nineteenth Metropolitan Magistrate’s Court found the couple guilty and sentenced them to two years of rigorous imprisonment and a penalty of Rs 10,000 each. Prema Kumari, a resident of Neredmet in Secunderabad, had approached the police in 2015, stating that her elder son, Amit and his wife, Lavanya, had illegally taken possession of her house and kicked her out. Prema's husband had died in 2013.In 2015, Amit and Lavanya had shifted from their home to Musheerabad, to Prema's house in Neredmet, and allegedly locked her out.“My elder son has threatened to kill me if I ask about the house. He claims that it is his property and abused me in very vulgar language. My life has been threatened and my elder son Amit would be responsible for it,” Prema's complaint reportedly stated.The police had registered a case under Sections 341 (Wrongful restraint), 471 (Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 506 (Criminal intimidation) and 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC and arrested the couple and filed a chargesheet.Delivering the verdict, the court said that Prema, who was living with her other children, could now return to her home.While the Supreme Court has stated in the past that abusive adult children can be evicted by parents from their own home, there are also laws which ensure the safety of the parents.The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 states that it was enacted ""to provide for more effective provisions for the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens, guaranteed and recognized under the Constitution and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.""Read: Abused, abandoned, neglected: A law protects senior citizens in India, but not many know of it",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/son-and-wife-throw-out-mother-her-house-hyderabad-get-2-year-jail-term-105930?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
831,TN man transfused with HIV+ blood as baby compensated after 20 years,A Chennai court has directed a hospital to pay a compensation of â‚¹20 lakh to a man who was infected with HIV-positive blood via transfusion as a toddler in 1999. The court also ordered the government to provide employment to the 21-year-old man. It further observed that the loss and physical and mental injury caused to the family is irretrievable.,The News Minute,"In a case of justice awfully delayed for a family from Tamil Nadu, a civil court in Chennai has directed the Institute Of Child Health and Hospital for Children in Chennai to pay a sum of Rs 20 lakh to a man who was infected with HIV positive blood as a toddler. The court has also ordered the government to provide employment to the 21-year-old to enable him to live the rest of his life with dignity.In 1999, the couple, who worked as daily wage labourers, admitted their nine-month-old son to the hospital, popularly known as the Egmore Children’s Hospital, following complaints of diarrhea and vomiting. The couple was told that their son needed a blood transfusion as well as surgery since his intestines were intertwined. The court found that since the couple were not able to comprehend the medical issues explained by the doctor, they requested the doctors to do what they thought was the best to save him from pain. While the blood transfusion was unsuccessful prior to the surgery, it was possible for the doctors to transfuse the blood after surgery. However, just two days after the surgery, the toddler fell ill again and was taken to the hospital. Blood tests soon revealed that the child was HIV positive, despite no close relatives or parents being infected.The government hospital had claimed that Sriram* 'could have contracted the disease due to inadequate treatment taken in a private hospital.' Judge Thenmozhe of the XVII Additional City Civil Court said that no proof was forthcoming from the government to substantiate this claim. “When this court puts specific question to the Egmore Children’s Hospital, it has been stated that no surgery was conducted on victim in a private hospital and no blood was transfused to him in any private hospital. His parents are poor coolies and the mother has specifically stated that she has not taken any treatment in a private hospital for her son. The Egmore Children’s Hospital who is equipped with a government machinery with several facilities ought to have verified the allegations in their written statement.” observed the judge. The court also noted that the loss and physical and mental injury caused to the family is irretrievable. ""The knowledgeable and skilled person from the hospital breached duty of care and protection. Hospital failed to convey the risk accompanying in the blood transfusion and negligently contaminated blood which is hazard to life and health passed to petitioner's son's tender body and made his body as carriage for life threatening virus,” observed the court.While the government hospital argued that it had already paid Rs 50,000 to Sriram's family, the civil court said that that this was merely towards medical expenses and cannot be considered as compensation for the negligence on the part of the [hospital] employees.Elaborating on the social and emotional costs, the court deemed Rs 9 lakh for mental agony, Rs 3 lakh for medical expenses, Rs 2 lakh for pain and suffering, Rs 2 lakh for loss of family life, Rs 1 lakh for loss of job opportunities, Rs 1 lakh for travel expenses and extra nourishment, Rs 2 lakh for loss of social status— a total of Rs 20 lakh.*Name changed",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/chennai-man-transfused-hiv-blood-baby-compensated-20-years-later-105929?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
833,I like Pakistani reporters much better than US reporters: Trump,"During his meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in the White House, US President Donald Trump asked a reporter if he is from Pakistan. He further said, ""I want a couple of Pakistani reporters. I like them much better than our [US] reporters."" The US President has in the past called his country's media ""fake"" and ""dishonest"".",The White House,"Oval Office12:13 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  It’s my great honor to have the very popular and, by the way, great athlete — one of the greatest — but very popular Prime Minister of Pakistan.We have many things to discuss: military and terrorism and trade.  And I think we’re going to spend a lot of time talking about trade because we do very little trade with Pakistan compared to what we could be doing and should be doing when our countries really get along perfectly.  And I think we’re having that start.  We’re going to have that start.But there’s tremendous upside with respect to trade.  One of the things we’re going to be discussing too is hostages; perhaps the polio vaccine, because Pakistan is one of the countries, and we’ll talk about that as to, you know, what your feeling is on that.  But we have a situation in Pakistan where we want to talk about the polio, or the possible polio vaccine.And I think we’re going to have great meetings.  We’re going to be spending a long time together.  We have our representatives meeting right after we’re finished.  And we just came out, Mr. Prime Minister, with tremendous economic numbers for the United States — the best we’ve ever had.  We’ve got the best economy we’ve ever had.  And I think we can shift some of that over to Pakistan.  We should be doing tremendous business together.  So, I look forward to it.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Inshallah.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And it is an honor to have you with us.  Thank you very much.Q    And, Prime Minister Khan, can you speak (inaudible) —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Well, I’ve been looking forward to this meeting since I assumed office as Prime Minister of Pakistan.  I mean, the United States is vital for Pakistan.  We have links which have gone back since Pakistan became independent.  You know, we’ve been fighting wars together: first Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan was a frontline state, allied to the U.S.  And then again the War on Terror, which was after 9/11.So I look forward to my conversation with you, Mr. President.Q    Mr. President, Pakistan has been your ally for 14 years into the Afghan War.  So, first terrorism, first economy disaster, and all that.  And, still, we — we were taken to the court with all the accusations that Pakistan is now responsible to (inaudible).Now, when India has — India and U.S. has developed an alliance in the region.  How do, you know, you plan to foresight about the Pak-U.S. relationship — how they can be strengthened when your preference is India?  Number one.And secondly, you know, after your campaign, what kind of promises — if you are elected again, what kind of promises you are going to fulfill?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  That’s a big question.  (Laughter.)  That could go on for hours — that answer.I will say that we have a very good relationship with India.  I know that your relationship is strained a little bit.  Maybe a lot.  But we will be talking about India; a very big part of our conversation today.  And I think maybe if we can help intercede and do whatever we have to do.  But I think it’s something that can be brought back together.And we’ll also be talking about Afghanistan.  We’ve reduced our number of troops there by quite a bit.  We are continuing to reduce troops in Afghanistan.  We’re working with Pakistan and others on getting an agreement signed, as you know.  And we’ll see what happens.But we will be talking about India and Afghanistan very much so.Q    The Washington Post is reporting today that Huawei had a relationship with North Korea to build their commercial wireless network.  Have you been briefed on that?  Do you have concerns?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I know all about it.  I know all about Huawei.  I know all about 5G.  And we’re working on it, and we have companies that are now getting very, very strong in that department.  And we’re going to have 5G.  We’re going to have the best 5G in the world, just like we have everything else.Our Silicone [sic] — Silicon Valley cannot be competed with.  There’s nobody that can compete with Silicon Valley for the brainpower or for what we do.And nobody was focused on 5G but now they are.  And we have great companies going into 5G.  Even if they don’t want to, a lot of them were very happy doing what they were doing.  But now they’re going — at my request, they’re going into 5G.  So we don’t need — we don’t need anything from anybody.Q    Do you have any additional concerns with North Korea?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Say it?  What?Q    The Post is reporting about Huawei’s relationship with North Korea.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’ll have to find out.  Our relationship with North Korea has been very good.  We’ve really established a good relationship with Kim Jong Un.  I have personally.  There’s no rocket testing.  There’s no missile testing.  We’re getting our remains back.  We got our hostages back.And we have a very, very good relationship, the two of us, and that’s very important.  There’s been no nuclear testing.  And what they’re doing with 5G will be, you know — we will have to see.  I’ll have to — I’ll find out.Q    This is (inaudible) from (inaudible) News TV Pakistan.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Say it again.Q    This is (inaudible) from (inaudible) News TV Pakistan.  Lindsey Graham, when he met Imran Khan, he says you both are kind of same personalities.  You are the President who fulfill all your promises with the campaign.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I do.  I do.Q    And the same Imran Khan; he’s also fulfilling all his promises.  So how do you see this meeting?  Like, same kind of person?  Straight to point?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think we’re going to have a great meeting today.  I know that it’s an important meeting.  I consider this a very important meeting because I think we haven’t met the potential of either country.  I think the potential with Pakistan and likewise, the opposite way, I think we have not even come close to meeting it.  There is tremendous potential between our country and Pakistan.I think Pakistan is going to help us out to extricate ourselves.  We’re like policemen.  We’re not fighting the war.  If we wanted to fight a war in Afghanistan and win it, I could win that war in a week.  I just don’t want to kill 10 million people.  Does that make sense to you?  I don’t want to kill 10 million people.I have plans on Afghanistan that, if I wanted to win that war, Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the Earth.  It would be gone.  It would be over in — literally, in 10 days.  And I don’t want to do — I don’t want to go that route.So we’re working with Pakistan and others to extricate ourselves.  Nor do we want to be policemen, because basically we’re policemen right now.  And we’re not supposed to be policemen.  We’ve been there — we’ve been there for 19 years, in Afghanistan.  It’s ridiculous.  And I think Pakistan helps us with that because we don’t want to stay as policemen.  But if we wanted to, we could win that war.  I have a plan that would win that war in a very short period of time.  You understand that better than anybody.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Mm-hmm.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ve been in there not fighting to win, just fighting to — they’re building gas stations; they’re rebuilding schools.  The United States, we shouldn’t be doing that.  That’s for them to do.But what we did and what our leadership got us into was ridiculous.  But we will — I think we’ll have some very good answers on Afghanistan, very quickly.Q    Mr. President, Jerry Nadler says the Mueller report lays out evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors.Q    (Inaudible.)PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, go ahead.  You go ahead.  Go ahead.Q    Does that concern you about Wednesday?Q    This is (inaudible) from GTV Network Pakistan.  The Pakistani army has fought war against terror.  And it has fought and protected and gave sacrifices in protecting Pakistan-Afghanistan border, as well.  But Pakistan’s sincerity was always doubted.  Coalition support fund was suspended by U.S. Defense Department.  So, at this time, the Pakistani economy is facing great trouble.  Are you going to restore any package for Pakistan?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  So we are going to — that’s right — we were paying $1.3 billion to Pakistan as aid, for many years.  The problem was Pakistan — this is before you — Pakistan was not doing anything for us.  They were really, I think, subversive.  They were going against us.  And this is something we’ll be ta- — I ended that about a year and a half ago, the $1.3 billion.And I tell you what: To be honest, I think we have a better relationship with Pakistan right now than we did when we were paying that money.  But all of that can come back, depending on what we work out.We’re working out things that are very important.  We have a very — I consider this very important.  We’re working out things that are very, very important.  And I think, at the end of this, at the end of a very short time, we’re going to have a very great relationship with Pakistan.  And we should.  It’s a great country.  It’s a great — they’re great people.  I have many friends from Pakistan.  Living in New York, I have a lot of Pakistani friends — I will tell you that.  And they’re great people: smart, tough.  They are tough.  There’s no question about that.  They’re like him; they’re tough.  (Laughter.)Q    Mr. President, are you worried about Wednesday?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I’m not going to be watching.  Probably.  Maybe I’ll see a little bit of it.  I’m not going to be watching Mueller because you can’t take all those bites out of the apple.We had no collusion, no obstruction.  We had no nothing.  We had a total “no collusion” finding.  The Democrats were devastated by it.  They went crazy.  They’ve gone off the deep end.  They’re not doing anything.  They’re not doing healthcare.  They’re not going infrastructure.They’re not lowering drug prices.  I’m lowering drug prices.  First time in 53 years that drug prices went down last year.  Fifty-three years.  And I’m doing that without the help of Congress, which makes it much tougher to do.  Because if they worked with us, I could get drug prices down in half.  But the Democrats don’t seem to care about drug prices.  All they care about is a phony investigation where the report was written — it said “no collusion” — the report was written, and the Attorney General, based on the report, was easily able to find there was no obstruction.  There’s no nothing.  They’re wasting their time.And Robert Mueller, I know he’s conflicted — he had a lot — there’s a lot of conflicts that he’s got, including the fact that his best friend is Comey.  But he’s got conflicts with me, too.  He’s got big conflicts with me.  As you know, he wanted the job of the FBI Director.  He didn’t get it.  And we had a business relationship where I said, “No.”  And I would say that he wasn’t happy.  Then, all of a sudden, he gets this position.  But you know what?  He still ruled — and I respect him for it — he still ruled “no collusion, no obstruction.”And this thing should’ve ended a long time ago.  This has been going on for two and a half years.  And we’re never going to allow this to happen to another President again because most of them wouldn’t be able to take it.On top of everything else, we have the strongest economy.  We were just discussing this with the Prime Minister.  We have the strongest economy that the United States has ever had.  We have the highest stock market.  Yesterday, literally, the highest stock market we’ve ever had on Friday — Thursday.We’ve broken the record, I think, 109 times for highest stock market.  But on, I believe, Thursday of last week we hit the all-time highest in the history of our country.Our country is doing phenomenally well.  Unemployment is the lowest in 51 years, soon to be the lowest in history if it keeps going this way in a short period of time.  Black, Hispanic, Asian unemployment — the lowest in history.  Women — the lowest in 72 years.Nobody has ever done what we’ve done.  Nobody has done in two and a half years what we’ve done: the biggest tax cuts in history; the biggest regulation cuts in history.  So many things for healthcare.  We got rid of the individual mandate which was the worst part of Obamacare.  Going to end up — if we end up winning the House back, we keep the presidency, we should keep the Senate.  We should keep the presidency, I would think easy, when you have the strongest economy in the history of our country.  And somebody is going to run against that particular President even though, in this case, it’s me.  In theory, I have a big advantage.  I don’t know.  I’m going to have to ask you.  But, in theory, I have a big advantage.So a lot of great things are happening.  But the Democrats, they don’t want to talk about that.  They want to stay off the economy subject.  And what they’re doing is just hearing after hearing after hearing.  It’s nonsense.  Okay?  They tried an impeachment vote, and they got slaughtered last week.  They got absolutely slaughtered.  It was the most ridiculous — I didn’t even know they were going to do it.And I’ll tell you, just in finishing: I have a lot of respect for the Democrats because most of them voted against impeachment last week.  And I have a lot of respect for those Democrats that did that because they’re doing the right thing for the country.  No collusion, no obstruction.Okay.  Anybody else?Q    Mr. President, on the debt talks — sir, on the debt talks, can you tell us if there is a deal soon?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, we’re talking about it.  Secretary Mnuchin is talking about it.  We’re having very good talks with the Speaker of the House — with Nancy Pelosi.  We’re having very good talks with Chuck Schumer and, of course, with Mitch McConnell and Kevin.  We are — Kevin McCarthy.We are, I think, doing very well on debt, if you look at debt limit, however you want to define that.  But we’re doing very well on that, and, I think, we’re doing pretty well on our budget.Very important that we take care of our military.
Our military was depleted, and in the last two and a half years, we’ve un-depleted it, okay?  To put it mildly.  We have made it stronger than ever before.  We need another big year.  So we had $700 billion, we had then $716 billion, and this year we’re going to be asking for a number slightly larger than that.
We’re putting our military back into a shape that it’s never been in before: new.  The best missiles in the world.  The best equipment in the world.  The best military equipment of all.  We’re building submarines — the finest.  Nobody can even think about competing with what we’re building.  We’re building, as you know, new submarines.We have a new aircraft carrier coming online.  It’s the largest ship in the world.  It’s so large that maybe I could even land a plane on top of it, okay?  But it’s a big — it’s a big one.  President Gerald Ford.  It’s a phenomenal — it’s a phenomenal ship.So what we’re doing — what we’re doing is incredible things for our country.And, you know, just about — just about — and I might say this about the military equipment: It’s all made in the USA — everything.  A hundred percent.  It’s all made in the USA.  And, you know, it’s one of the reasons our job numbers probably are so good — the lowest unemployment.Yeah.  Go ahead.Q    Mr. President, will you be visiting Pakistan?  As you’ve described, Pakistan is a great country.  So he will be definitely extending you an invitation.  So will you be visiting Pakistan?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I can’t say that yet because, so far, he has not extended me an invitation.  (Laughter.)  And after today’s meeting, maybe he won’t.  But I have a feeling he might.  Yes, I’d love to go Pakistan at the right time.Q    On Pakistan, Mr. President —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, please.Q    Bahzad Saleemi, here from Pakistani News Channel (inaudible).  Is there any exact date or timeframe of U.S. troops withdrawal under consideration under your administration?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you talking about from Afghanistan?Q    Yes.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, we have already withdrawn quite a few.  And we’re doing it very slowly and very safely.  And we’re working with Pakistan and with — as you know, we’re negotiating with the Taliban.  And we are doing, I think, very well in that regard.Again, it’s something that we could do — we could go one of two ways: We could do a number the likes of which they’ve never seen before, and win it very quickly.  I don’t want to do that.  I don’t want to do that because you’re talking about millions of people, and I don’t want to do that.And we’re working with Pakistan on getting a solution.  And I think — I think it’s being worked very well, wouldn’t you say so, Mr. Prime Minister?Q    Will there still be troops there on Election Day?  Will there still be troops there on Election Day in Afghanistan — U.S. troops?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I don’t know.  We’re moving a lot of them out.  And —Q    Do you want them to be gone by then?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And we’ve done what we’re supposed to do.  We’ve been there for 19 years, and we’ve acted as policemen, not soldiers.  And, again, if we wanted to be soldiers, it would be over in 10 days.  One week to 10 days, if we wanted to.But I have not chosen that.  Why are we — why would we kill millions of people?  It wouldn’t be fair.  In terms of humanity, it wouldn’t be fair.  So we’re doing very well, and I think that Pakistan is going to be a big help.Q    What role do you see for India and Afghanistan?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Say it?Q    What role do you see for India and Afghanistan?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, same question to you.  What — does India has a role to bring peace in Afghanistan?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  You see, this is the closest we’ve been to a peace deal in Afghanistan.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  And there is no military solution in Afghanistan.  There is no military solution because, as Mr. President says, if you go all-out military, there will be millions and millions of people who will die.So there is only one solution.  And I feel — and I think we will discuss this — it’s the closest we have been to a peace deal.  And we hope that in the coming days we will be able to urge the Taliban to speak to the Afghan government and come to a settlement — a political solution.PRESIDENT TRUMP:   And what the Prime Minister —Q    (Inaudible).PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Excuse me.  What the Prime Minister just said is a very big story.  And it’s 100 percent true.  We’re — we’ve made a lot of progress over the last couple of weeks, and Pakistan has helped us with that progress.But a lot of great things are happening.  A lot of things are happening for the United States, and I think a lot of great things are going to be happening for Pakistan too, under your leadership.  I really feel that.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Thank you.  Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Okay?Q    Mr. President, on Iran, are we closer to negotiations or to armed conflict?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think Iran doesn’t know where they are.  I’ve been watching and reading a lot of reports.  And right now, they’re a very mixed up country.  They don’t know whether they’re coming or going.  They have tremendous problems economically.  Their country is in turmoil.  They’re having demonstrations all over Iran.  They’re inflation rate is at 75 percent.  They have a lot of problems.So whatever it is, it is.  I’m just going to sit back and wait.  Let’s see what happens.  But I will say —Q    What can you tell us about the CIA assets?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — they are doing very poorly as a country, and we’ll see what happens.We did, actually — because they said no — and, you know, it’s a religious country, or religious leaders, but they lie a lot.  We did shoot down — unfortunately, we had to shoot down a drone.  The drone came down.  You know how it — how it came down with a new technology that’s actually quite amazing.  But we took down one of their drones.  Instead of saying, “Yeah, that happened,” they lied.  They say it didn’t happen.So we have — there’s a lot of proof.  It’s called “take a look at it on the ocean floor.”  Just go down there — take your scuba gear and go down there in the — one of you would do that, I know.  But we took down a drone.I think very importantly — I read a report today about CIA; that’s totally a false story.  That’s another lie.  They put out propaganda.  They put out lies.  I don’t think Pakistan would ever do a thing like that, right?  Pakistan —PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Definitely not.PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Pakistan never lies.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Definitely not.PRESIDENT TRUMP:   But Iran does, unfortunately.  So let’s see what happens with Iran.  We are ready for the absolute worst.  And we’re ready for sense, too.  But we are very geared up.  And if they — they are really the number-one state of terror in the world.  Now, I have to say, they’ve pulled back because their money is running very low.  The deal that President Obama made was a disaster because it was such a short term.  It didn’t cover ballistic missiles.  And they couldn’t see the important sites.  Under this you couldn’t inspect the important sites.  There were many things wrong.And, of course, they gave 150 billion dollars plus 1.8 billion in green — green, beautiful cash.  That’s called many plane loads of cash.  I think Pakistan would like to have some of that cash.  But they gave $1.8 billion in cash, which is unthinkable.And instead of being respectful and thankful — which, frankly, they should have been to the United States and to President Obama for making that ridiculous deal — instead of being respectful, they put their finger up in the air — this finger, the thumb — they put their finger up in the air and they disrespected the United States.  They shouldn’t have done that.  That was a big mistake.One of the best things I’ve done is terminate that ridiculous deal.  If they want to make a deal, it’s — frankly, it’s getting harder for me to want to make a deal with Iran because they behave very badly.  They’re saying bad things.And I’ll tell you, it could go either way very easily.  Very easily.  And I’m okay either way it goes.Q    Mr. President (inaudible) —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.  You’re from Pakistan?Q    Yeah, I’m from Pakistan.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I want a couple of Pakistani reporters.  I like them.  I like them much better than our reporters.Q    (Inaudible) News.  (Inaudible.)  Question is: What do you think Pakistan could (inaudible) in 18 years?  And you have so much hope now that (inaudible).  What are those things that Pakistan could do right now?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You mean what they didn’t do to end the war?Q    (Inaudible) 18 years they could do now.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I don’t think Pakistan — look, I don’t think Pakistan respected the United States.  I don’t think Pakistan respected its presidents.  And I think Pakistan could have done a lot.  I think Pakistan can do tremendous amount against — with respect to Afghanistan.  They didn’t do it and I don’t’ blame them because they were dealing with the wrong President.  Who knows?  But I think Pakistan could have done — they’re helping us a lot now.I think they could have helped us a lot in the past.  But it doesn’t matter.  We have a new leader; he’s doing to be a great leader of Pakistan.  And we have a new leader here.  Sort of new; I’m two and half years now — getting to be three years, can you believe it?  You’re going to find time flies.But, no, I think Pakistan could have done a lot but they chose not to.  And that’s because they did not respect U.S. leadership.Q    Is Pakistan doing enough now?  Is Pakistan doing enough now?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I’ll let you know that very quickly.  I’ll let you know.  I mean, I’m going to know soon.  It’s not going to be like a long-term thing.  I figure things out very quickly.So the question was — that’s probably the best question you’ve asked in a long time.  (Laughter.)  First time — she’s always asking, “Mueller.  Mueller.  Mueller.”  It’s been — she’s been asking this Mueller thing for three years.  It’s your best question.  So I have to focus on that because that’s such a great question.I think Pakistan is going to do a lot.  I really do. I think Pakistan is going to make a big difference.  I think Pakistan will save millions of lives in Afghanistan because I really believe that they can — they have a power that other nations don’t have with respect to Afghanistan.And I will say, as of this moment, they’re working very hard and very nicely, and we appreciate it.Q    (Inaudible) reports and video of protestors in Hong Kong — in these ongoing protests — being beaten by gangs.  And, potentially, the Hong Kong and Chinese governments are sort of looking the other way, allowing these people — protestors to be beaten.  Have you seen any of that footage?  Have you been briefed on any of that?  Do you have any —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I have.Q    — message to Beijing and China?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And, you know, I know President Xi.  We’re working on trade deals right now.  We’ll see what happens.  In the meantime, they’re paying us billions and billions of dollars of tariffs, which is fine with me.But I know that they’re working — I know that’s a very important situation for President Xi.  And, you know, you could say what you said, but you could also say that he has allowed that to go on for a long time, and, you know, it’s been relatively — I think it’s been relatively non-violent.Q    Do you believe that protestors should be allowed to protest on the streets of Hong Kong, as they’ve been doing peacefully?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, they are.  I mean, they are.  I don’t think China has stopped them.  But China could stop them if they wanted.  I think — I think that — again, I’m not involved in it very much — but I think President Xi of China has acted responsibly.  Very responsibly.  They’ve been out there protesting for a long time.I’ve never seen protests like it, where you have that many people. It likes two million people.  Those are big protests.  But I think that President — I hope that President Xi will do the right thing.  But it has been going on a long time.  There’s no question about it.Do you want to do a couple more?  Do you have anybody you want to take a question from?Q    Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President made good remarks about Pakistan and said that Pakistan can help lot to end the violence in Afghanistan — the dialogue process and reconciliation process.  So what really Pakistan can do to bring peace?  Because you are also (inaudible) by your military commander, General Bajwa and other security team.So what solution Pakistan — what strategy paper you have to push forward the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan and assurances to the U.S.?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Number one, this is the longest war that the United States has ever fought.  It’s almost 19 years.Number two, I am one of those who always believed that there was no military solution, because anyone who knows the history of Afghanistan — you just have to look back at the history — there was always going to be a political settlement at the end.And I have to compliment President Trump because he has now forced people to end the war, to have a settlement.  And that’s where I think Pakistan is playing a very important role because Pakistan has a 1,500-mile border with Afghanistan, and all the areas where the trouble is — which is the eastern side of Afghanistan.So this is a critical time.  I’m looking forward to my talks with President Trump.  We have our military leadership here because this is obviously a security situation.  And what we want is understanding between the two countries.  I can assure President Trump that whatever we will be saying will be the — we will be straight with them.  There will never be any question of any doubt on Pakistan’s intent, because apart from Afghanistan, the country that wants peace in Afghanistan more than any other country is Pakistan because we get directly affected by it.And Pakistan needs stability.  We have had 15 years of fighting this war on terror.  Over 70,000 Pakistani causalities.  Over $150 billion lost to the economy.  So we desperately want peace.  And I’m happy that President Trump has pushed this forward.  So we hope — I’m looking forward to these talks.Q    Disrupting the peace in the region, and apart from Afghanistan, there is another security threat in South Asia, and that is Kashmir dispute unresolved even by the United Nations and even by the U.S., who voted in support of that resolution in the U.N.Now, are you going to make any kind of submission and intervention, President Trump?  And the same question to Mr. President Trump —PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I will —Q    Is he going to play any role in that Kashmir, where millions have been dead?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay, he’s got it.  He’s got it.Q    Thank you.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I will be asking President Trump.  He’s — it’s the most powerful country in the world, the United States.  It can play the most important role in bringing peace in the subcontinent.  You know, there are over a — over a billion and a quarter people in the subcontinent.  They are held hostage to the issue of Kashmir.  And I feel that only the most powerful state, headed by President Trump, can bring the two countries together.From my point, I can tell you, we have tried our best.  We’ve made all overtures to India to start dialogue, resolve our differences through dialogue.  But unfortunately, we haven’t made headways as yet.  But I’m hoping that President Trump would push this process.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  So I was with — I was with Prime Minister Modi two weeks ago, and we talked about this subject.  And he actually said, “Would you like to be a mediator or arbitrator?”  I said, “Where?”  He said, “Kashmir.”  Because this has been going on for many, many years.  I was surprised at how long; it’s been going on a long —PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Seventy years.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And I think they’d like to see it resolved.  And I think you’d like to see it resolved.  And if I can help, I would love to be a mediator.  It shouldn’t be — I mean, it’s impossible to believe two incredible countries that are very, very smart, with very smart leadership, can’t solve a problem like that.  But if you want me to mediate or arbitrate, I would be willing to do that.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  President, I can tell you that, right now, you would have the prayers of over a billion people if you can mediate and resolve this issue.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It should be resolved.  So it — but he asked me the same, so I think there’s something.  So maybe we’ll speak to him or I’ll speak to him, and we’ll see if we can do something because I’ve heard so much about Kashmir.  Such a beautiful name.  It’s supposed to be such a beautiful part of the world.  But right now there’s just bombs all over the place.  They say everywhere you go, you have bombs and it’s a terrible situation.  Been going on for many years.  If I can do anything to help that, let me know.Let me give you one thing on Afghanistan, as an example.  So a lot of you don’t know this, but we dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb ever built in history.  We dropped it in Afghanistan.  We were getting ready to make many of those bombs.  This left a hole that was — it took out a lot of the tunnels and everything else.  But it left a hole in the Earth that looked like the moon; it looked like a crater from the moon.  It’s still there.  It was — nobody has ever seen anything like it.  People heard it 15 miles away.  They said, “What was that?”  It shook the Earth.  Non-nuclear — the largest ever made, by far.And they were going to make many of them.  And I said, “No, we don’t have to.  I don’t want to drop that.  I don’t want to do that.”  So many easy solutions.  That’s actually the easy solution.  And they’d come in and they’d say, “Let’s have peace.”  But you don’t have to do that.  I think we’re going to be very successful with having to go that route.  And I have tremendous confidence in the Prime Minister.All right, one or two more.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, please.Q    This is Nadeem from Voice of America.  Are you going to raise the issue of Dr. Shakil Afridi with PM Imran Khan?  And, PM, question to you regarding the freedom of the press in Pakistan: There are a lot of curbs on the freedom of press, on the media, on the journalists.  Can you comment on that?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead, please.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Pakistan press — to scorn Pakistan press as if there’s curbs on it.  Pakistan has one of the freest presses in the world.  All you have to do is — since I’ve been the Prime Minister in the last 10 months — I mean, the criticism I have received from my own press: unprecedented.So to say that there are curbs on Pakistan press is a joke.Q    Mr. Prime Minister, I —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  When you say “unprecedented,” it can’t —Q    Mr. Prime Minister —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait. There’s no way you’re treated worse than I am.  (Laughter.)PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  (Laughs.)  It’s worse than you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I mean, that can’t be.Q    Mr. Prime Minister, you are fighting — Mr. Prime Minister, you are fighting —Q    (Inaudible.)PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You’re going to have to speak because I didn’t hear your words.Q    Yeah, the question was: Are you going to raise the issue of freedom or release of Dr. Shakil Afridi?  Dr. Shakil Afridi.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Freedom of the press?Q    Dr. Shakil Afridi.Q    Dr. Shakil Afridi.  The doctor who helped —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Oh, yes.  We will do that.  We will — we’re talking about hostages.  We’re talking about hostages being held in various places.  I’ve had very good luck with hostages with North Korea, with many places.  They’ve treated us with respect, and I appreciate it.  It made a big difference.We have two or three hostages that we’re talking about.  That’s one of the gentlemen that we have heard about.  And we’ll be — we will be discussing that with many other subjects.  Yes, we will.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  And President Trump —Q    (Inaudible.)PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Just a minute.  Trump, we will be giving you a good news about the two hostages (inaudible).PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Good.  Thank you.Q    On your tweets this morning — why are you escalating the feud with the four congresswomen?  The racial tensions —Q    On North Korea, sir — on North Korea, sir —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’ll tell you in a second.Go ahead.  Ask again.Q    On your tweets — why are you escalating your feud with the four congresswomen and racial tensions in so doing?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think they’re very bad for our country.  I really think they must hate our country.  I think the four congressmen we’re talking about — the congresswomen, what they’ve said about Israel, what they’ve said about our country, when they talk about “disgusting people,” when they talk the way they talk; when the one mentioned that “brown people should speak for brown people,” and “Muslim people should speak for Muslim people,” and you hear all this — it’s not what our country is all about.No, I think they’re very bad for our country.  I think they’re very bad for the Democrat Party.  I think you see that.  And they’re pulling the Democrats way left.  Nobody knows how to handle them.  I feel they’re easy to handle.  To me, they’re easy to handle because they’re just out there.  They’re very bad for our country.  Absolutely.Q    Are you stoking racial tensions?  But are you stoking racial tensions in so doing?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I don’t think — no, no, no racial tension.  No, no, there’s no racial tension.Look, I had my best numbers recently, and it’s because of the economy and what I’ve done for the African American.  When you look at — the African Americans are doing better than they’ve ever done in our country.  They’re — we’re creating numbers — look at the poverty numbers.  Look at so many different — look at the unemployment numbers.  The best they’ve ever had.No, we have fantastic relationships with the African American community.  I think you’ll see that.  Certainly, you’re going to see that in 2020, I believe.Q    Mr. President, even your critics — even your critics say that you’re going to win the 2020 election.  And you’re obviously very confident about that.  Same thing, Imran Kahn.  Sir, you are also heading up a big war against corruption in Pakistan.  So can you just give us a little comment on that?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think he’s going to win.  And I think what’s going to happen — of course, he’s got a little ways to wait — (laughter) — but I’ll go over — I’m going to campaign for you.  I’m going to help him win his campaign.Q    Mr. President, I’m (inaudible) representing Associated Press of Pakistan.  Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that Pakistan is looking for trade and economic relationships and investment in Pakistan.  Are you willing to do that?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.Q    Because many experts say that economic prosperity is the best antidote to extremism and militancy.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree.  And I think that’s very true.  And that’s actually a very good question.  The answer is yes.  I see great trade with Pakistan.  And I’m not — I’m not talking about a little bit more.  I’m talking about — we could go 10 and even 20 times what we’re doing right now.You know, Pakistan is a big country.  It’s actually a very big country, and they have tremendous product.  They make great product.  They make tremendous — I’ve bought from Pakistan over the years when I was in the private sector.  They make incredible product.  They’re brilliant people.  They’re hardworking people.I think we’re going to have a fantastic trade relationship.  I don’t mean we’ll increase it by 20 percent.  I mean, I think we can quadruple it.  I think it could go — I mean, literally, it sounds crazy — you could go 10 times more.  You could go 20 times more.  Because what we do right now is not much, and we should do a lot.So I think that’s going to be — and I also do agree that that has so much to do with great peace.  Having a great trading relationship has so much to do with peace and extremism, in this case.  I think it can have a — so I expect that we will, within a very short period of time, start having very significant trade with Pakistan.Q    Sir, are there any lower working-level talks with North Korea scheduled at this point since you met with Kim Jong Un at the DMZ?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, we just have a very good relationship, and probably they would like to meet.  And we’ll see what happens.  There was a little correspondence recently — very positive correspondence — with North Korea.Q    Between you or your staff?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Again, there’s no nuclear testing.  There’s no missile testing.  There’s no nothing.  I think we will — yeah, at a certain point.Q    What’s the roadmap to working-level talks, sir?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  When they’re ready — when they’re ready, we’ll be meeting.Q    They’re not ready yet, sir?Q    One question, please?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead.Q    One question, please.  (Inaudible) from (inaudible) Pakistan.  Did you raise the case for Dr. Afridi?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Well, there will be things discussed.  So, you know, that would be for afterwards.Q    Mr. President, on Puerto Rico?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll be — we’ll be discussing it.Q    A question on India.  Pakistan — one of the (inaudible) Pakistan (inaudible) where India (inaudible) a non-state actors to destabilize them.  And the people from there are going to Europe and other places.  And they’re getting refused.  They’re getting asylum in India, which is actually an indication that India is helping those non-state actors to infiltrate in Pakistan and create that.  One of the guy Pakistan is holding — which was the (inaudible) network.  So you do you think that the U.S. will be playing a role in stopping India to, you know, destabilizing the region?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think I can very well.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi.  And I think we’re going to have a phenomenal relationship with the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  I do think that it’s a two-way street.  You know, you say India is coming in and destabilizing Pakistan, but India is saying that Pakistan is coming in and destabilizing.  So there’s a lot of room right there where we can meet.  I think we can meet.You had a question on Puerto Rico?Q    Should the governor of Puerto Rico step down right now?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Did he step down?Q    Should he.  Should he.  He says he’s not going to because he’s not going to run for reelection.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He’s a terrible governor.  I think you have an even worse mayor of San Juan.  She’s horrible.  I think she’s horrible.  I watched her — my people did nothing but complain about her when we helped them with their hurricane problem.  The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, is a horror show.  She’s incompetent.  Grossly incompetent.  At the same time, the governor is not good.So the United States Congress — you won’t believe this; please close your ears because this would be — gave Puerto Rico $92 billion last year for hurricane relief.  No, they haven’t gotten the money, all of it, but they’ve got a lot of it, but they’re scheduled to get.  The Congress of the United States handed them $92 billion.  And that $92 billion is in the hands of incompetent people and very corrupt people.But the governor has done a terrible job.  And the mayor of San Juan has — she’s horrible.  I think she’s just terrible.  She’s so bad for her people.  And I think the government of the United States — they have to be careful.I’m the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico because we did a great job in Puerto Rico.  They don’t like to give me the credit for it, but we did a great job.  I have many Puerto Rican friends.  I have a real understanding of Puerto Rico.  I’ve had jobs in Puerto Rico.I had — I think the most successful — I owned the Miss Universe contests and pageants, and we had them in Puerto Rico twice.  And I’ll tell you, we had tremendous successes.  In fact, they said literally 100 percent — this never happens — almost — I think it was close to 100 — but 100 percent of the island itself was watching.  They liked those pageants.Now, I’ve had a great relationship with Puerto Rico.  I’m the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico.  But Congress has given them $92 billion.  Pakistan would like some of that, right?  Ninety-two, not 1.3 — because Pakistan was getting 1.3.  Ninety-two billion dollars, and the money is squandered and wasted and stolen.And I’ll tell you what: The senators are not happy about it, and Congress is not happy about it.  Because you really do — you have incompetent — totally grossly, incompetent leadership at the top of Puerto Rico.  The people of Puerto Rico are great.  And the people of Puerto Rico like me, and they should because nobody has given them what I give them.  But the leadership is corrupt and incompetent.Thank you very much, everybody.END12:55 P.M.

835,Relations with Pak improved after we ended $1.3 billion aid: Trump,"During his meeting with Pakistan PM Imran Khan, US President Donald Trump said relations between the two countries improved after the US ended the $1.3 billion aid that it had been giving to Pakistan. ""We were paying $1.3 billion...Pakistan was not doing anything for us,"" Trump added. US ended the aid after Pakistan failed to combat terrorism on its soil.",The White House,"Oval Office12:13 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  It’s my great honor to have the very popular and, by the way, great athlete — one of the greatest — but very popular Prime Minister of Pakistan.We have many things to discuss: military and terrorism and trade.  And I think we’re going to spend a lot of time talking about trade because we do very little trade with Pakistan compared to what we could be doing and should be doing when our countries really get along perfectly.  And I think we’re having that start.  We’re going to have that start.But there’s tremendous upside with respect to trade.  One of the things we’re going to be discussing too is hostages; perhaps the polio vaccine, because Pakistan is one of the countries, and we’ll talk about that as to, you know, what your feeling is on that.  But we have a situation in Pakistan where we want to talk about the polio, or the possible polio vaccine.And I think we’re going to have great meetings.  We’re going to be spending a long time together.  We have our representatives meeting right after we’re finished.  And we just came out, Mr. Prime Minister, with tremendous economic numbers for the United States — the best we’ve ever had.  We’ve got the best economy we’ve ever had.  And I think we can shift some of that over to Pakistan.  We should be doing tremendous business together.  So, I look forward to it.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Inshallah.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And it is an honor to have you with us.  Thank you very much.Q    And, Prime Minister Khan, can you speak (inaudible) —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Well, I’ve been looking forward to this meeting since I assumed office as Prime Minister of Pakistan.  I mean, the United States is vital for Pakistan.  We have links which have gone back since Pakistan became independent.  You know, we’ve been fighting wars together: first Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan was a frontline state, allied to the U.S.  And then again the War on Terror, which was after 9/11.So I look forward to my conversation with you, Mr. President.Q    Mr. President, Pakistan has been your ally for 14 years into the Afghan War.  So, first terrorism, first economy disaster, and all that.  And, still, we — we were taken to the court with all the accusations that Pakistan is now responsible to (inaudible).Now, when India has — India and U.S. has developed an alliance in the region.  How do, you know, you plan to foresight about the Pak-U.S. relationship — how they can be strengthened when your preference is India?  Number one.And secondly, you know, after your campaign, what kind of promises — if you are elected again, what kind of promises you are going to fulfill?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  That’s a big question.  (Laughter.)  That could go on for hours — that answer.I will say that we have a very good relationship with India.  I know that your relationship is strained a little bit.  Maybe a lot.  But we will be talking about India; a very big part of our conversation today.  And I think maybe if we can help intercede and do whatever we have to do.  But I think it’s something that can be brought back together.And we’ll also be talking about Afghanistan.  We’ve reduced our number of troops there by quite a bit.  We are continuing to reduce troops in Afghanistan.  We’re working with Pakistan and others on getting an agreement signed, as you know.  And we’ll see what happens.But we will be talking about India and Afghanistan very much so.Q    The Washington Post is reporting today that Huawei had a relationship with North Korea to build their commercial wireless network.  Have you been briefed on that?  Do you have concerns?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I know all about it.  I know all about Huawei.  I know all about 5G.  And we’re working on it, and we have companies that are now getting very, very strong in that department.  And we’re going to have 5G.  We’re going to have the best 5G in the world, just like we have everything else.Our Silicone [sic] — Silicon Valley cannot be competed with.  There’s nobody that can compete with Silicon Valley for the brainpower or for what we do.And nobody was focused on 5G but now they are.  And we have great companies going into 5G.  Even if they don’t want to, a lot of them were very happy doing what they were doing.  But now they’re going — at my request, they’re going into 5G.  So we don’t need — we don’t need anything from anybody.Q    Do you have any additional concerns with North Korea?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Say it?  What?Q    The Post is reporting about Huawei’s relationship with North Korea.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’ll have to find out.  Our relationship with North Korea has been very good.  We’ve really established a good relationship with Kim Jong Un.  I have personally.  There’s no rocket testing.  There’s no missile testing.  We’re getting our remains back.  We got our hostages back.And we have a very, very good relationship, the two of us, and that’s very important.  There’s been no nuclear testing.  And what they’re doing with 5G will be, you know — we will have to see.  I’ll have to — I’ll find out.Q    This is (inaudible) from (inaudible) News TV Pakistan.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Say it again.Q    This is (inaudible) from (inaudible) News TV Pakistan.  Lindsey Graham, when he met Imran Khan, he says you both are kind of same personalities.  You are the President who fulfill all your promises with the campaign.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I do.  I do.Q    And the same Imran Khan; he’s also fulfilling all his promises.  So how do you see this meeting?  Like, same kind of person?  Straight to point?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think we’re going to have a great meeting today.  I know that it’s an important meeting.  I consider this a very important meeting because I think we haven’t met the potential of either country.  I think the potential with Pakistan and likewise, the opposite way, I think we have not even come close to meeting it.  There is tremendous potential between our country and Pakistan.I think Pakistan is going to help us out to extricate ourselves.  We’re like policemen.  We’re not fighting the war.  If we wanted to fight a war in Afghanistan and win it, I could win that war in a week.  I just don’t want to kill 10 million people.  Does that make sense to you?  I don’t want to kill 10 million people.I have plans on Afghanistan that, if I wanted to win that war, Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the Earth.  It would be gone.  It would be over in — literally, in 10 days.  And I don’t want to do — I don’t want to go that route.So we’re working with Pakistan and others to extricate ourselves.  Nor do we want to be policemen, because basically we’re policemen right now.  And we’re not supposed to be policemen.  We’ve been there — we’ve been there for 19 years, in Afghanistan.  It’s ridiculous.  And I think Pakistan helps us with that because we don’t want to stay as policemen.  But if we wanted to, we could win that war.  I have a plan that would win that war in a very short period of time.  You understand that better than anybody.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Mm-hmm.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ve been in there not fighting to win, just fighting to — they’re building gas stations; they’re rebuilding schools.  The United States, we shouldn’t be doing that.  That’s for them to do.But what we did and what our leadership got us into was ridiculous.  But we will — I think we’ll have some very good answers on Afghanistan, very quickly.Q    Mr. President, Jerry Nadler says the Mueller report lays out evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors.Q    (Inaudible.)PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, go ahead.  You go ahead.  Go ahead.Q    Does that concern you about Wednesday?Q    This is (inaudible) from GTV Network Pakistan.  The Pakistani army has fought war against terror.  And it has fought and protected and gave sacrifices in protecting Pakistan-Afghanistan border, as well.  But Pakistan’s sincerity was always doubted.  Coalition support fund was suspended by U.S. Defense Department.  So, at this time, the Pakistani economy is facing great trouble.  Are you going to restore any package for Pakistan?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  So we are going to — that’s right — we were paying $1.3 billion to Pakistan as aid, for many years.  The problem was Pakistan — this is before you — Pakistan was not doing anything for us.  They were really, I think, subversive.  They were going against us.  And this is something we’ll be ta- — I ended that about a year and a half ago, the $1.3 billion.And I tell you what: To be honest, I think we have a better relationship with Pakistan right now than we did when we were paying that money.  But all of that can come back, depending on what we work out.We’re working out things that are very important.  We have a very — I consider this very important.  We’re working out things that are very, very important.  And I think, at the end of this, at the end of a very short time, we’re going to have a very great relationship with Pakistan.  And we should.  It’s a great country.  It’s a great — they’re great people.  I have many friends from Pakistan.  Living in New York, I have a lot of Pakistani friends — I will tell you that.  And they’re great people: smart, tough.  They are tough.  There’s no question about that.  They’re like him; they’re tough.  (Laughter.)Q    Mr. President, are you worried about Wednesday?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I’m not going to be watching.  Probably.  Maybe I’ll see a little bit of it.  I’m not going to be watching Mueller because you can’t take all those bites out of the apple.We had no collusion, no obstruction.  We had no nothing.  We had a total “no collusion” finding.  The Democrats were devastated by it.  They went crazy.  They’ve gone off the deep end.  They’re not doing anything.  They’re not doing healthcare.  They’re not going infrastructure.They’re not lowering drug prices.  I’m lowering drug prices.  First time in 53 years that drug prices went down last year.  Fifty-three years.  And I’m doing that without the help of Congress, which makes it much tougher to do.  Because if they worked with us, I could get drug prices down in half.  But the Democrats don’t seem to care about drug prices.  All they care about is a phony investigation where the report was written — it said “no collusion” — the report was written, and the Attorney General, based on the report, was easily able to find there was no obstruction.  There’s no nothing.  They’re wasting their time.And Robert Mueller, I know he’s conflicted — he had a lot — there’s a lot of conflicts that he’s got, including the fact that his best friend is Comey.  But he’s got conflicts with me, too.  He’s got big conflicts with me.  As you know, he wanted the job of the FBI Director.  He didn’t get it.  And we had a business relationship where I said, “No.”  And I would say that he wasn’t happy.  Then, all of a sudden, he gets this position.  But you know what?  He still ruled — and I respect him for it — he still ruled “no collusion, no obstruction.”And this thing should’ve ended a long time ago.  This has been going on for two and a half years.  And we’re never going to allow this to happen to another President again because most of them wouldn’t be able to take it.On top of everything else, we have the strongest economy.  We were just discussing this with the Prime Minister.  We have the strongest economy that the United States has ever had.  We have the highest stock market.  Yesterday, literally, the highest stock market we’ve ever had on Friday — Thursday.We’ve broken the record, I think, 109 times for highest stock market.  But on, I believe, Thursday of last week we hit the all-time highest in the history of our country.Our country is doing phenomenally well.  Unemployment is the lowest in 51 years, soon to be the lowest in history if it keeps going this way in a short period of time.  Black, Hispanic, Asian unemployment — the lowest in history.  Women — the lowest in 72 years.Nobody has ever done what we’ve done.  Nobody has done in two and a half years what we’ve done: the biggest tax cuts in history; the biggest regulation cuts in history.  So many things for healthcare.  We got rid of the individual mandate which was the worst part of Obamacare.  Going to end up — if we end up winning the House back, we keep the presidency, we should keep the Senate.  We should keep the presidency, I would think easy, when you have the strongest economy in the history of our country.  And somebody is going to run against that particular President even though, in this case, it’s me.  In theory, I have a big advantage.  I don’t know.  I’m going to have to ask you.  But, in theory, I have a big advantage.So a lot of great things are happening.  But the Democrats, they don’t want to talk about that.  They want to stay off the economy subject.  And what they’re doing is just hearing after hearing after hearing.  It’s nonsense.  Okay?  They tried an impeachment vote, and they got slaughtered last week.  They got absolutely slaughtered.  It was the most ridiculous — I didn’t even know they were going to do it.And I’ll tell you, just in finishing: I have a lot of respect for the Democrats because most of them voted against impeachment last week.  And I have a lot of respect for those Democrats that did that because they’re doing the right thing for the country.  No collusion, no obstruction.Okay.  Anybody else?Q    Mr. President, on the debt talks — sir, on the debt talks, can you tell us if there is a deal soon?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, we’re talking about it.  Secretary Mnuchin is talking about it.  We’re having very good talks with the Speaker of the House — with Nancy Pelosi.  We’re having very good talks with Chuck Schumer and, of course, with Mitch McConnell and Kevin.  We are — Kevin McCarthy.We are, I think, doing very well on debt, if you look at debt limit, however you want to define that.  But we’re doing very well on that, and, I think, we’re doing pretty well on our budget.Very important that we take care of our military.
Our military was depleted, and in the last two and a half years, we’ve un-depleted it, okay?  To put it mildly.  We have made it stronger than ever before.  We need another big year.  So we had $700 billion, we had then $716 billion, and this year we’re going to be asking for a number slightly larger than that.
We’re putting our military back into a shape that it’s never been in before: new.  The best missiles in the world.  The best equipment in the world.  The best military equipment of all.  We’re building submarines — the finest.  Nobody can even think about competing with what we’re building.  We’re building, as you know, new submarines.We have a new aircraft carrier coming online.  It’s the largest ship in the world.  It’s so large that maybe I could even land a plane on top of it, okay?  But it’s a big — it’s a big one.  President Gerald Ford.  It’s a phenomenal — it’s a phenomenal ship.So what we’re doing — what we’re doing is incredible things for our country.And, you know, just about — just about — and I might say this about the military equipment: It’s all made in the USA — everything.  A hundred percent.  It’s all made in the USA.  And, you know, it’s one of the reasons our job numbers probably are so good — the lowest unemployment.Yeah.  Go ahead.Q    Mr. President, will you be visiting Pakistan?  As you’ve described, Pakistan is a great country.  So he will be definitely extending you an invitation.  So will you be visiting Pakistan?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I can’t say that yet because, so far, he has not extended me an invitation.  (Laughter.)  And after today’s meeting, maybe he won’t.  But I have a feeling he might.  Yes, I’d love to go Pakistan at the right time.Q    On Pakistan, Mr. President —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, please.Q    Bahzad Saleemi, here from Pakistani News Channel (inaudible).  Is there any exact date or timeframe of U.S. troops withdrawal under consideration under your administration?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you talking about from Afghanistan?Q    Yes.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, we have already withdrawn quite a few.  And we’re doing it very slowly and very safely.  And we’re working with Pakistan and with — as you know, we’re negotiating with the Taliban.  And we are doing, I think, very well in that regard.Again, it’s something that we could do — we could go one of two ways: We could do a number the likes of which they’ve never seen before, and win it very quickly.  I don’t want to do that.  I don’t want to do that because you’re talking about millions of people, and I don’t want to do that.And we’re working with Pakistan on getting a solution.  And I think — I think it’s being worked very well, wouldn’t you say so, Mr. Prime Minister?Q    Will there still be troops there on Election Day?  Will there still be troops there on Election Day in Afghanistan — U.S. troops?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I don’t know.  We’re moving a lot of them out.  And —Q    Do you want them to be gone by then?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And we’ve done what we’re supposed to do.  We’ve been there for 19 years, and we’ve acted as policemen, not soldiers.  And, again, if we wanted to be soldiers, it would be over in 10 days.  One week to 10 days, if we wanted to.But I have not chosen that.  Why are we — why would we kill millions of people?  It wouldn’t be fair.  In terms of humanity, it wouldn’t be fair.  So we’re doing very well, and I think that Pakistan is going to be a big help.Q    What role do you see for India and Afghanistan?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Say it?Q    What role do you see for India and Afghanistan?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, same question to you.  What — does India has a role to bring peace in Afghanistan?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  You see, this is the closest we’ve been to a peace deal in Afghanistan.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  And there is no military solution in Afghanistan.  There is no military solution because, as Mr. President says, if you go all-out military, there will be millions and millions of people who will die.So there is only one solution.  And I feel — and I think we will discuss this — it’s the closest we have been to a peace deal.  And we hope that in the coming days we will be able to urge the Taliban to speak to the Afghan government and come to a settlement — a political solution.PRESIDENT TRUMP:   And what the Prime Minister —Q    (Inaudible).PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Excuse me.  What the Prime Minister just said is a very big story.  And it’s 100 percent true.  We’re — we’ve made a lot of progress over the last couple of weeks, and Pakistan has helped us with that progress.But a lot of great things are happening.  A lot of things are happening for the United States, and I think a lot of great things are going to be happening for Pakistan too, under your leadership.  I really feel that.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Thank you.  Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Okay?Q    Mr. President, on Iran, are we closer to negotiations or to armed conflict?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think Iran doesn’t know where they are.  I’ve been watching and reading a lot of reports.  And right now, they’re a very mixed up country.  They don’t know whether they’re coming or going.  They have tremendous problems economically.  Their country is in turmoil.  They’re having demonstrations all over Iran.  They’re inflation rate is at 75 percent.  They have a lot of problems.So whatever it is, it is.  I’m just going to sit back and wait.  Let’s see what happens.  But I will say —Q    What can you tell us about the CIA assets?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — they are doing very poorly as a country, and we’ll see what happens.We did, actually — because they said no — and, you know, it’s a religious country, or religious leaders, but they lie a lot.  We did shoot down — unfortunately, we had to shoot down a drone.  The drone came down.  You know how it — how it came down with a new technology that’s actually quite amazing.  But we took down one of their drones.  Instead of saying, “Yeah, that happened,” they lied.  They say it didn’t happen.So we have — there’s a lot of proof.  It’s called “take a look at it on the ocean floor.”  Just go down there — take your scuba gear and go down there in the — one of you would do that, I know.  But we took down a drone.I think very importantly — I read a report today about CIA; that’s totally a false story.  That’s another lie.  They put out propaganda.  They put out lies.  I don’t think Pakistan would ever do a thing like that, right?  Pakistan —PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Definitely not.PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Pakistan never lies.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Definitely not.PRESIDENT TRUMP:   But Iran does, unfortunately.  So let’s see what happens with Iran.  We are ready for the absolute worst.  And we’re ready for sense, too.  But we are very geared up.  And if they — they are really the number-one state of terror in the world.  Now, I have to say, they’ve pulled back because their money is running very low.  The deal that President Obama made was a disaster because it was such a short term.  It didn’t cover ballistic missiles.  And they couldn’t see the important sites.  Under this you couldn’t inspect the important sites.  There were many things wrong.And, of course, they gave 150 billion dollars plus 1.8 billion in green — green, beautiful cash.  That’s called many plane loads of cash.  I think Pakistan would like to have some of that cash.  But they gave $1.8 billion in cash, which is unthinkable.And instead of being respectful and thankful — which, frankly, they should have been to the United States and to President Obama for making that ridiculous deal — instead of being respectful, they put their finger up in the air — this finger, the thumb — they put their finger up in the air and they disrespected the United States.  They shouldn’t have done that.  That was a big mistake.One of the best things I’ve done is terminate that ridiculous deal.  If they want to make a deal, it’s — frankly, it’s getting harder for me to want to make a deal with Iran because they behave very badly.  They’re saying bad things.And I’ll tell you, it could go either way very easily.  Very easily.  And I’m okay either way it goes.Q    Mr. President (inaudible) —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.  You’re from Pakistan?Q    Yeah, I’m from Pakistan.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I want a couple of Pakistani reporters.  I like them.  I like them much better than our reporters.Q    (Inaudible) News.  (Inaudible.)  Question is: What do you think Pakistan could (inaudible) in 18 years?  And you have so much hope now that (inaudible).  What are those things that Pakistan could do right now?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You mean what they didn’t do to end the war?Q    (Inaudible) 18 years they could do now.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I don’t think Pakistan — look, I don’t think Pakistan respected the United States.  I don’t think Pakistan respected its presidents.  And I think Pakistan could have done a lot.  I think Pakistan can do tremendous amount against — with respect to Afghanistan.  They didn’t do it and I don’t’ blame them because they were dealing with the wrong President.  Who knows?  But I think Pakistan could have done — they’re helping us a lot now.I think they could have helped us a lot in the past.  But it doesn’t matter.  We have a new leader; he’s doing to be a great leader of Pakistan.  And we have a new leader here.  Sort of new; I’m two and half years now — getting to be three years, can you believe it?  You’re going to find time flies.But, no, I think Pakistan could have done a lot but they chose not to.  And that’s because they did not respect U.S. leadership.Q    Is Pakistan doing enough now?  Is Pakistan doing enough now?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I’ll let you know that very quickly.  I’ll let you know.  I mean, I’m going to know soon.  It’s not going to be like a long-term thing.  I figure things out very quickly.So the question was — that’s probably the best question you’ve asked in a long time.  (Laughter.)  First time — she’s always asking, “Mueller.  Mueller.  Mueller.”  It’s been — she’s been asking this Mueller thing for three years.  It’s your best question.  So I have to focus on that because that’s such a great question.I think Pakistan is going to do a lot.  I really do. I think Pakistan is going to make a big difference.  I think Pakistan will save millions of lives in Afghanistan because I really believe that they can — they have a power that other nations don’t have with respect to Afghanistan.And I will say, as of this moment, they’re working very hard and very nicely, and we appreciate it.Q    (Inaudible) reports and video of protestors in Hong Kong — in these ongoing protests — being beaten by gangs.  And, potentially, the Hong Kong and Chinese governments are sort of looking the other way, allowing these people — protestors to be beaten.  Have you seen any of that footage?  Have you been briefed on any of that?  Do you have any —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I have.Q    — message to Beijing and China?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And, you know, I know President Xi.  We’re working on trade deals right now.  We’ll see what happens.  In the meantime, they’re paying us billions and billions of dollars of tariffs, which is fine with me.But I know that they’re working — I know that’s a very important situation for President Xi.  And, you know, you could say what you said, but you could also say that he has allowed that to go on for a long time, and, you know, it’s been relatively — I think it’s been relatively non-violent.Q    Do you believe that protestors should be allowed to protest on the streets of Hong Kong, as they’ve been doing peacefully?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, they are.  I mean, they are.  I don’t think China has stopped them.  But China could stop them if they wanted.  I think — I think that — again, I’m not involved in it very much — but I think President Xi of China has acted responsibly.  Very responsibly.  They’ve been out there protesting for a long time.I’ve never seen protests like it, where you have that many people. It likes two million people.  Those are big protests.  But I think that President — I hope that President Xi will do the right thing.  But it has been going on a long time.  There’s no question about it.Do you want to do a couple more?  Do you have anybody you want to take a question from?Q    Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President made good remarks about Pakistan and said that Pakistan can help lot to end the violence in Afghanistan — the dialogue process and reconciliation process.  So what really Pakistan can do to bring peace?  Because you are also (inaudible) by your military commander, General Bajwa and other security team.So what solution Pakistan — what strategy paper you have to push forward the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan and assurances to the U.S.?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Number one, this is the longest war that the United States has ever fought.  It’s almost 19 years.Number two, I am one of those who always believed that there was no military solution, because anyone who knows the history of Afghanistan — you just have to look back at the history — there was always going to be a political settlement at the end.And I have to compliment President Trump because he has now forced people to end the war, to have a settlement.  And that’s where I think Pakistan is playing a very important role because Pakistan has a 1,500-mile border with Afghanistan, and all the areas where the trouble is — which is the eastern side of Afghanistan.So this is a critical time.  I’m looking forward to my talks with President Trump.  We have our military leadership here because this is obviously a security situation.  And what we want is understanding between the two countries.  I can assure President Trump that whatever we will be saying will be the — we will be straight with them.  There will never be any question of any doubt on Pakistan’s intent, because apart from Afghanistan, the country that wants peace in Afghanistan more than any other country is Pakistan because we get directly affected by it.And Pakistan needs stability.  We have had 15 years of fighting this war on terror.  Over 70,000 Pakistani causalities.  Over $150 billion lost to the economy.  So we desperately want peace.  And I’m happy that President Trump has pushed this forward.  So we hope — I’m looking forward to these talks.Q    Disrupting the peace in the region, and apart from Afghanistan, there is another security threat in South Asia, and that is Kashmir dispute unresolved even by the United Nations and even by the U.S., who voted in support of that resolution in the U.N.Now, are you going to make any kind of submission and intervention, President Trump?  And the same question to Mr. President Trump —PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I will —Q    Is he going to play any role in that Kashmir, where millions have been dead?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay, he’s got it.  He’s got it.Q    Thank you.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I will be asking President Trump.  He’s — it’s the most powerful country in the world, the United States.  It can play the most important role in bringing peace in the subcontinent.  You know, there are over a — over a billion and a quarter people in the subcontinent.  They are held hostage to the issue of Kashmir.  And I feel that only the most powerful state, headed by President Trump, can bring the two countries together.From my point, I can tell you, we have tried our best.  We’ve made all overtures to India to start dialogue, resolve our differences through dialogue.  But unfortunately, we haven’t made headways as yet.  But I’m hoping that President Trump would push this process.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  So I was with — I was with Prime Minister Modi two weeks ago, and we talked about this subject.  And he actually said, “Would you like to be a mediator or arbitrator?”  I said, “Where?”  He said, “Kashmir.”  Because this has been going on for many, many years.  I was surprised at how long; it’s been going on a long —PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Seventy years.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And I think they’d like to see it resolved.  And I think you’d like to see it resolved.  And if I can help, I would love to be a mediator.  It shouldn’t be — I mean, it’s impossible to believe two incredible countries that are very, very smart, with very smart leadership, can’t solve a problem like that.  But if you want me to mediate or arbitrate, I would be willing to do that.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  President, I can tell you that, right now, you would have the prayers of over a billion people if you can mediate and resolve this issue.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It should be resolved.  So it — but he asked me the same, so I think there’s something.  So maybe we’ll speak to him or I’ll speak to him, and we’ll see if we can do something because I’ve heard so much about Kashmir.  Such a beautiful name.  It’s supposed to be such a beautiful part of the world.  But right now there’s just bombs all over the place.  They say everywhere you go, you have bombs and it’s a terrible situation.  Been going on for many years.  If I can do anything to help that, let me know.Let me give you one thing on Afghanistan, as an example.  So a lot of you don’t know this, but we dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb ever built in history.  We dropped it in Afghanistan.  We were getting ready to make many of those bombs.  This left a hole that was — it took out a lot of the tunnels and everything else.  But it left a hole in the Earth that looked like the moon; it looked like a crater from the moon.  It’s still there.  It was — nobody has ever seen anything like it.  People heard it 15 miles away.  They said, “What was that?”  It shook the Earth.  Non-nuclear — the largest ever made, by far.And they were going to make many of them.  And I said, “No, we don’t have to.  I don’t want to drop that.  I don’t want to do that.”  So many easy solutions.  That’s actually the easy solution.  And they’d come in and they’d say, “Let’s have peace.”  But you don’t have to do that.  I think we’re going to be very successful with having to go that route.  And I have tremendous confidence in the Prime Minister.All right, one or two more.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, please.Q    This is Nadeem from Voice of America.  Are you going to raise the issue of Dr. Shakil Afridi with PM Imran Khan?  And, PM, question to you regarding the freedom of the press in Pakistan: There are a lot of curbs on the freedom of press, on the media, on the journalists.  Can you comment on that?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead, please.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Pakistan press — to scorn Pakistan press as if there’s curbs on it.  Pakistan has one of the freest presses in the world.  All you have to do is — since I’ve been the Prime Minister in the last 10 months — I mean, the criticism I have received from my own press: unprecedented.So to say that there are curbs on Pakistan press is a joke.Q    Mr. Prime Minister, I —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  When you say “unprecedented,” it can’t —Q    Mr. Prime Minister —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait. There’s no way you’re treated worse than I am.  (Laughter.)PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  (Laughs.)  It’s worse than you.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I mean, that can’t be.Q    Mr. Prime Minister, you are fighting — Mr. Prime Minister, you are fighting —Q    (Inaudible.)PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You’re going to have to speak because I didn’t hear your words.Q    Yeah, the question was: Are you going to raise the issue of freedom or release of Dr. Shakil Afridi?  Dr. Shakil Afridi.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Freedom of the press?Q    Dr. Shakil Afridi.Q    Dr. Shakil Afridi.  The doctor who helped —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Oh, yes.  We will do that.  We will — we’re talking about hostages.  We’re talking about hostages being held in various places.  I’ve had very good luck with hostages with North Korea, with many places.  They’ve treated us with respect, and I appreciate it.  It made a big difference.We have two or three hostages that we’re talking about.  That’s one of the gentlemen that we have heard about.  And we’ll be — we will be discussing that with many other subjects.  Yes, we will.PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  And President Trump —Q    (Inaudible.)PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Just a minute.  Trump, we will be giving you a good news about the two hostages (inaudible).PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Good.  Thank you.Q    On your tweets this morning — why are you escalating the feud with the four congresswomen?  The racial tensions —Q    On North Korea, sir — on North Korea, sir —PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’ll tell you in a second.Go ahead.  Ask again.Q    On your tweets — why are you escalating your feud with the four congresswomen and racial tensions in so doing?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think they’re very bad for our country.  I really think they must hate our country.  I think the four congressmen we’re talking about — the congresswomen, what they’ve said about Israel, what they’ve said about our country, when they talk about “disgusting people,” when they talk the way they talk; when the one mentioned that “brown people should speak for brown people,” and “Muslim people should speak for Muslim people,” and you hear all this — it’s not what our country is all about.No, I think they’re very bad for our country.  I think they’re very bad for the Democrat Party.  I think you see that.  And they’re pulling the Democrats way left.  Nobody knows how to handle them.  I feel they’re easy to handle.  To me, they’re easy to handle because they’re just out there.  They’re very bad for our country.  Absolutely.Q    Are you stoking racial tensions?  But are you stoking racial tensions in so doing?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I don’t think — no, no, no racial tension.  No, no, there’s no racial tension.Look, I had my best numbers recently, and it’s because of the economy and what I’ve done for the African American.  When you look at — the African Americans are doing better than they’ve ever done in our country.  They’re — we’re creating numbers — look at the poverty numbers.  Look at so many different — look at the unemployment numbers.  The best they’ve ever had.No, we have fantastic relationships with the African American community.  I think you’ll see that.  Certainly, you’re going to see that in 2020, I believe.Q    Mr. President, even your critics — even your critics say that you’re going to win the 2020 election.  And you’re obviously very confident about that.  Same thing, Imran Kahn.  Sir, you are also heading up a big war against corruption in Pakistan.  So can you just give us a little comment on that?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think he’s going to win.  And I think what’s going to happen — of course, he’s got a little ways to wait — (laughter) — but I’ll go over — I’m going to campaign for you.  I’m going to help him win his campaign.Q    Mr. President, I’m (inaudible) representing Associated Press of Pakistan.  Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that Pakistan is looking for trade and economic relationships and investment in Pakistan.  Are you willing to do that?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.Q    Because many experts say that economic prosperity is the best antidote to extremism and militancy.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree.  And I think that’s very true.  And that’s actually a very good question.  The answer is yes.  I see great trade with Pakistan.  And I’m not — I’m not talking about a little bit more.  I’m talking about — we could go 10 and even 20 times what we’re doing right now.You know, Pakistan is a big country.  It’s actually a very big country, and they have tremendous product.  They make great product.  They make tremendous — I’ve bought from Pakistan over the years when I was in the private sector.  They make incredible product.  They’re brilliant people.  They’re hardworking people.I think we’re going to have a fantastic trade relationship.  I don’t mean we’ll increase it by 20 percent.  I mean, I think we can quadruple it.  I think it could go — I mean, literally, it sounds crazy — you could go 10 times more.  You could go 20 times more.  Because what we do right now is not much, and we should do a lot.So I think that’s going to be — and I also do agree that that has so much to do with great peace.  Having a great trading relationship has so much to do with peace and extremism, in this case.  I think it can have a — so I expect that we will, within a very short period of time, start having very significant trade with Pakistan.Q    Sir, are there any lower working-level talks with North Korea scheduled at this point since you met with Kim Jong Un at the DMZ?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, we just have a very good relationship, and probably they would like to meet.  And we’ll see what happens.  There was a little correspondence recently — very positive correspondence — with North Korea.Q    Between you or your staff?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Again, there’s no nuclear testing.  There’s no missile testing.  There’s no nothing.  I think we will — yeah, at a certain point.Q    What’s the roadmap to working-level talks, sir?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  When they’re ready — when they’re ready, we’ll be meeting.Q    They’re not ready yet, sir?Q    One question, please?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead.Q    One question, please.  (Inaudible) from (inaudible) Pakistan.  Did you raise the case for Dr. Afridi?PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Well, there will be things discussed.  So, you know, that would be for afterwards.Q    Mr. President, on Puerto Rico?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll be — we’ll be discussing it.Q    A question on India.  Pakistan — one of the (inaudible) Pakistan (inaudible) where India (inaudible) a non-state actors to destabilize them.  And the people from there are going to Europe and other places.  And they’re getting refused.  They’re getting asylum in India, which is actually an indication that India is helping those non-state actors to infiltrate in Pakistan and create that.  One of the guy Pakistan is holding — which was the (inaudible) network.  So you do you think that the U.S. will be playing a role in stopping India to, you know, destabilizing the region?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think I can very well.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi.  And I think we’re going to have a phenomenal relationship with the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  I do think that it’s a two-way street.  You know, you say India is coming in and destabilizing Pakistan, but India is saying that Pakistan is coming in and destabilizing.  So there’s a lot of room right there where we can meet.  I think we can meet.You had a question on Puerto Rico?Q    Should the governor of Puerto Rico step down right now?PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Did he step down?Q    Should he.  Should he.  He says he’s not going to because he’s not going to run for reelection.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He’s a terrible governor.  I think you have an even worse mayor of San Juan.  She’s horrible.  I think she’s horrible.  I watched her — my people did nothing but complain about her when we helped them with their hurricane problem.  The mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, is a horror show.  She’s incompetent.  Grossly incompetent.  At the same time, the governor is not good.So the United States Congress — you won’t believe this; please close your ears because this would be — gave Puerto Rico $92 billion last year for hurricane relief.  No, they haven’t gotten the money, all of it, but they’ve got a lot of it, but they’re scheduled to get.  The Congress of the United States handed them $92 billion.  And that $92 billion is in the hands of incompetent people and very corrupt people.But the governor has done a terrible job.  And the mayor of San Juan has — she’s horrible.  I think she’s just terrible.  She’s so bad for her people.  And I think the government of the United States — they have to be careful.I’m the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico because we did a great job in Puerto Rico.  They don’t like to give me the credit for it, but we did a great job.  I have many Puerto Rican friends.  I have a real understanding of Puerto Rico.  I’ve had jobs in Puerto Rico.I had — I think the most successful — I owned the Miss Universe contests and pageants, and we had them in Puerto Rico twice.  And I’ll tell you, we had tremendous successes.  In fact, they said literally 100 percent — this never happens — almost — I think it was close to 100 — but 100 percent of the island itself was watching.  They liked those pageants.Now, I’ve had a great relationship with Puerto Rico.  I’m the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico.  But Congress has given them $92 billion.  Pakistan would like some of that, right?  Ninety-two, not 1.3 — because Pakistan was getting 1.3.  Ninety-two billion dollars, and the money is squandered and wasted and stolen.And I’ll tell you what: The senators are not happy about it, and Congress is not happy about it.  Because you really do — you have incompetent — totally grossly, incompetent leadership at the top of Puerto Rico.  The people of Puerto Rico are great.  And the people of Puerto Rico like me, and they should because nobody has given them what I give them.  But the leadership is corrupt and incompetent.Thank you very much, everybody.END12:55 P.M.

After being in arrears (0-2), he brought out the best in a crunch situation to outwit favourites Sathiyan.A particular rally in the fourth game which brought a winning point to Desai must have been really demoralising for Sathiyan.Equally important was the win by Surat boy in the next which kept lingering until he sealed it 17-15.

The pair had, in the semifinals, beaten Singapore duo of Goi Rui Xuan and Wong Xin Ru in straight games, while Sreeja and Mousumi defeated the third Indian pair of Sutirtha Mukherjee and Ayhika Mukherjee, also by a 3-0 verdict.The domination of our paddlers at the championships could be gauged from the fact that all finals today featured only the Indians, making it more of a national event than an international one.

Their pod achieved the top speed of 463.49 kmph (288 mph), highest among any team to run in the finals. TUM beat out three other finalist competitors - Delft Hyperloop, EPFL Hyperloop, and Swissloop.",TechCrunch,"SpaceX  hosted its fourth annual SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition finals on Sunday at the test tube it built outside its Hawthorne HQ. We were on site for the competition, and watched as Team TUM, from the Technical University of Munich,  took home the win thanks to achieving the top speed overall of any team to run in the finals.TUM (formerly known as team WARR Hyperloop in past competitions) is a repeat winner, and achieved a top speed of 288 mph in this year’s finals. That’s the fastest overall for a Hyperloop pod thus far — it beat its own record from last year of 284 mph set during the third SpaceX student run-off. It wasn’t without incident, however — near the end of its run, there was a spark and some debris appeared to fly off the craft, but it still survived the run mostly intact and satisfied SpaceX judges to qualify for the win.TUM beat out three other finalist competitors, including Delft Hyperloop, EPFL Hyperloop and Swissloop. Delft unfortunately had a communication error that cut their run short at just around 650 feet into the just over 3/4-mile SpaceX Hyperloop test track. EPFL managed a top speed of 148 mph and Swissloop topped out at 160 mph.SpaceX Hyperloop Pod test track at its Hawthorne HQ; this is the end where student teams load in their test pod during the annual competitionSpaceX Hyperloop Pod test track at its Hawthorne HQ; this is the end where student teams load in their test pod during the annual competitionFor the teams that did get to run on Sunday, the process involved loading their pods, which are roughly the size of bobsleds but little more than engines on wheels, onto the single track, which runs the length of the interior of the Hyperloop test tube. The tube is then sealed and de-pressurized to near vacuum, which is essentially how Musk’s original Hyperloop concept envisioned the super-speed transportation method would work.All the teams gave a good showing, and the total number of student teams was actually 21, with more than 700 individuals total taking part in the competition from a variety of schools, including Cal Poly, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Indian Institute of Technology and my own alma mater, the University of Windsor (which worked with St. Clair College on their pod).Teams had to prove to their SpaceX and Boring Company staff advisors that they were ready to run in the tube in order to qualify for the finals, and spent two weeks prior to the finals on Sunday trying to do just that. Of those 21 teams, only the four finalists managed to get the green light to run in the final competition, based on advisor criteria that includes safety and survivability of their pod design. There’s a kind of “good luck” mantra at the competition of saying “Break a pod” prior to a run, but SpaceX engineers don’t actually want team pods to experience catastrophic failure inside the tube while on a run. This year, the competition was even more challenging because for the first time all pods had to use their own communication systems, and the pods must be designed to propel themselves to within 100 feet of the far end of the tube before they stop.21 teams competed this year, and they all brought their pods to display on race day, even though only four finalists actually ran their pods through the test track21 teams competed this year, and they all brought their pods to display on race day, even though only four finalists actually ran their pods through the test trackMost of the teams I spoke to that failed to qualify were dismayed, but also resolute on coming back and qualifying next year. Some did express a bit of frustration about the gap between some of the teams from smaller schools and those in the final four (which qualify repeatedly year after year). Many of the finalists have deep-pocketed corporate backers, including Airbus,  while some of the smaller schools have next to no funding — resulting in a cost delta of hundreds of thousands of dollars when it comes to the total bill for the test pods built.That said, all the teams are clearly thrilled to be able to participate, and see the competition as a chance to essentially get scored to work at one of Musk’s many high-tech ventures, including SpaceX, Tesla  and The Boring Company . For those companies, too, it seems like a no-brainer to attempt to recruit from the engineering ranks of these best-in-class technical undergrad and graduate students.EPFL Hyperloop didn’t win the competition — but they have reason to celebrate because at least some graduates will probably “win” jobs at Musk’s various companiesEPFL Hyperloop didn’t win the competition — but they have reason to celebrate because at least some graduates will probably “win” jobs at Musk’s various companies“I think the competition is fun, and inspiring and also useful technology comes out of it,” Musk said regarding the purpose of the event, before answering a final question from Boring Company President Steve Davis  about whether or not there will be another competition next year — “Oh yeah, of course,” Musk replied, to much applause from the crowd of competitors.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/21/team-tum-wins-spacex-hyperloop-pod-competition-with-record-288-mph-top-speed/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Watch archival video of the press conference.Participants included: FTC Chairman Joe Simons, CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger, and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh.Equifax Inc. has agreed to pay at least $575 million, and potentially up to $700 million, as part of a global settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and 50 U.S. states and territories, which alleged that the credit reporting company’s failure to take reasonable steps to secure its network led to a data breach in 2017 that affected approximately 147 million people.In its complaint, the FTC alleges that Equifax failed to secure the massive amount of personal information stored on its network, leading to a breach that exposed millions of names and dates of birth, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that could lead to identity theft and fraud.As part of the proposed settlement, Equifax will pay $300 million to a fund that will provide affected consumers with credit monitoring services. The fund will also compensate consumers who bought credit or identity monitoring services from Equifax and paid other out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the 2017 data breach. Equifax will add up to $125 million to the fund if the initial payment is not enough to compensate consumers for their losses. In addition, beginning in January 2020, Equifax will provide all U.S. consumers with six free credit reports each year for seven years—in addition to the one free annual credit report that Equifax and the two other nationwide credit reporting agencies currently provide.The company also has agreed to pay $175 million to 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as well as $100 million to the CFPB in civil penalties.“Companies that profit from personal information have an extra responsibility to protect and secure that data,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “Equifax failed to take basic steps that may have prevented the breach that affected approximately 147 million consumers. This settlement requires that the company take steps to improve its data security going forward, and will ensure that consumers harmed by this breach can receive help protecting themselves from identity theft and fraud.”“Today’s announcement is not the end of our efforts to make sure consumers’ sensitive personal information is safe and secure. The incident at Equifax underscores the evolving cyber security threats confronting both private and government computer systems and actions they must take to shield the personal information of consumers. Too much is at stake for the financial security of the American people to make these protections anything less than a top priority. For consumers impacted by the Equifax breach, today’s settlement will make available up to $425 million for time and money they spent to protect themselves from potential threats of identity theft or addressing incidents of identity theft as a result of the breach. We encourage consumers impacted by the breach to submit their claims in order to receive free credit monitoring or cash reimbursements,” said Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Kathleen L. Kraninger.Company’s Security FailuresThe FTC alleges that Equifax failed to patch its network after being alerted in March 2017 to a critical security vulnerability affecting its ACIS database, which handles inquiries from consumers about their personal credit data. Even though Equifax’s security team ordered that each of the company’s vulnerable systems be patched within 48 hours after receiving the alert, Equifax did not follow up to ensure the order was carried out by the responsible employees.In fact, Equifax did not discover that its ACIS database was unpatched until July 2017, when its security team detected suspicious traffic on its network. A company investigation revealed that multiple hackers were able to exploit the ACIS vulnerability to gain entry to Equifax’s network, where they accessed an unsecured file that included administrative credentials stored in plain text. These credentials allowed the hackers to gain access to vast amounts of consumers’ personally identifiable information and to operate undetected on Equifax’s network for months.The hackers targeted Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and other sensitive information, mostly from consumers who had purchased products from Equifax such as credit scores, credit monitoring, or identity theft prevention services. For example, hackers stole at least 147 million names and dates of birth, 145.5 million Social Security numbers, and 209,000 payment card numbers and expiration dates.Hackers were able to access a staggering amount of data because Equifax failed to implement basic security measures, according to the complaint. This includes failing to implement a policy to ensure that security vulnerabilities were patched; failing to segment its database servers to block access to other parts of the network once one database was breached; and failing to install robust intrusion detection protections for its legacy databases. In addition, the FTC also alleges that Equifax stored network credentials and passwords, as well as Social Security numbers and other sensitive consumer information, in plain text.Despite its failure to implement basic security measures, Equifax’s privacy policy at the time stated that it limited access to consumers’ personal information and implemented “reasonable physical, technical and procedural safeguards” to protect consumer data.The FTC alleges that Equifax violated the FTC Act’s prohibition against unfair and deceptive practices and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act’s Safeguards Rule, which requires financial institutions to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer information.Settlement RequirementsIn addition to the monetary relief to consumers, Equifax is also required to implement a comprehensive information security program requiring the company to take several measures including:The proposed settlement also requires the company to obtain third-party assessments of its information security program every two years. Under the order, the assessor must specify the evidence that supports its conclusions and conduct independent sampling, employee interviews, and document reviews. The order grants the Commission the authority to approve the assessor for each two-year assessment period. The order also requires Equifax to provide an annual update to the FTC about the status of the consumer claims process.Finally, the FTC encourages Equifax employees who believe the company is failing to adhere to its data security promises to email the FTC at equifax@ftc.gov. Consumers can find out more about the settlement at ftc.gov/Equifax.The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and proposed stipulated final order was 5-0. The FTC expects to file the complaint and proposed order today in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the named defendants are violating or are about to violate the law and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. Stipulated final orders have the force of law when approved and signed by the District Court judge.The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers.

917,Will retaliate if US imposes sanctions over Russian S-400: Turkey,"Turkey would retaliate against what it called an unacceptable threat of US sanctions over the country's purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence system, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said. ""This is not a threat or a bluff,"" he added. However, Cavusoglu further said he thinks US President Donald Trump wants to avoid such measures.",Reuters,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey would retaliate against what it called an unacceptable threat of U.S. sanctions over Ankara’s purchase of Russian S-400 missile defenses, its foreign minister said on Monday, adding he thinks President Donald Trump wants to avoid such measures.  Turkey began receiving deliveries of the surface-to-air S-400 systems earlier this month, prompting the United States to begin removing the NATO ally from its F-35 stealth fighter program over security concerns.    Washington says it is concerned that S-400 software will compromise its F-35s to the benefit of Russia. While several Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers have pressed for sanctions, Trump has equivocated in recent days. “If the United States portrays an adversarial attitude towards us, we will take retaliatory measures, as we’ve told them. This is not a threat or a bluff,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in an interview with broadcaster TGRT Haber. “We are not a country that will bow down to those who show a animosity towards Turkey,” he said, reiterating a threat of retaliation that Turkey made last month. Cavusoglu added that he did not expect the U.S. administration to take such action.  “Trump does not want to impose sanctions on Turkey and he frequently says that his administration and the previous U.S. administration is also responsible for Turkey not being able to buy Patriot systems. This is true,” Cavusoglu said.  The United States announced last week it was beginning the process of removing Turkey from the program for the F-35 stealth jets, the most advanced aircraft in the U.S. arsenal, which is used by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other partner countries.  Turkey, like some other NATO partners, was part of the manufacturing supply chain for the aircraft, producing some 900 parts and Turkish defense companies are set to lose work worth billions of dollars.  A U.S. official said it would cost some $500 million to $600 million to shift F-35 manufacturing from Turkey.  The delivery of S-400 components is ongoing, with 14 shipments of related equipment having landed in Turkey over the last nine days. Deliveries are set to continue through April 2020. Separately, Sergei Chemezov, head of Russia’s Rostec state conglomerate, said that Russia and Turkey were in talks about the possibility of jointly manufacturing some components of the  S-400 system in Turkey. “Moscow and Ankara are holding consultations in the area of the licensed production of the S-400 air defense system component parts,” Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Chemezov as saying. “Besides, Turkey is interested in the latest Russian combat modules, air defense systems of various ranges, as well as anti-tank systems. Negotiations are underway for Russia to help the Republic of Turkey in creating its national air defense and long-range missile defense systems,” he said. Chemezov added that Moscow was ready for various formats of technological cooperation, including in such high-tech areas as the aerospace industry, helicopter construction, and energy.

""The study and technological development of marijuana, hemp, and other medicinal herbs should be sped up,"" the policy document said. Thailand legalised marijuana for medical use and research last year.",Reuters,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Developing a medical cannabis industry is among top policy priorities for Thailand’s new government, according to a document released before the formal announcement. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former junta leader who heads a civilian government following March elections, is due to set out the policies for debate in the national assembly on Thursday. The policy document was released on Sunday. Developing the medical cannabis industry was a key demand of the Bhumjaithai party, one of the biggest parties in Prayuth’s 19-party coalition. “The study and technological development of marijuana, hemp, and other medicinal herbs should be sped up for the medical industry to create economic opportunity and income for the people,” the policy document said. Thailand, which had a tradition of using cannabis to relieve pain and fatigue, legalized marijuana for medical use and research last year. Bhumjaithai party leader Anutin Charnvirakul, now a deputy prime minister and health minister, said his goal was to enable all Thais to grow marijuana to make money. Anutin told local media it was important to remove hemp with a high level of cannabidiol (CBD) from the list of banned drugs for cultivation and then to free up hospitals to prescribe drugs containing the chemical compound.  Among other urgent government priorities were addressing drought, labor and economic problems. Also on the list was a study to amend a new constitution that critics say preserves the hold of the military indefinitely. This study had been a demand of another coalition partner, the Democrat Party. However, any constitutional changes would require the support of the Senate - which is entirely made up of appointees of the previous junta.

Post that, another comment which Taapsee made on Kangana needing a ‘double filter’ back in an interview was revealed by Rangoli on Twitter. Now, in a recent interview with Mumbai Mirror, Taapsee has explained everything about the spat between Kangana’s sister and her. The Game Over actor mentioned that after Rangoli made the ‘sasti copy’ comment, many of her Bollywood friends wanted to speak up. But Taapsee stopped them from doing so as she didn’t want to get into a war of words. The Manmarziyaan actress also revealed that she has also struggled to get where she is. Hence, no one can use the ‘nepotism’ card against her. (Also Read: Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli calls Taapsee Pannu a sasti copy; Anurag Kashyap calls it really desperate)Taapsee said, “Not just Anurag, a few other close friends from the industry also wanted to retort, but I stopped them because I don’t want to give her any mileage on my behalf. She can’t play the nepotism card with me because I’ve also struggled to reach where I am today. I didn’t want to engage in a word battle because I would not be able to match their language. I didn’t know there was a copyright on curly hair, which I was born with, and honest opinions. I’m not going to apologise for it. As far as being “sasti” is concerned, Kangana claims to be the highest-paid actress, so I guess I am the “sasti” version.” Kuch log Kangana ko copy kar ke he apni dukaan chalate hain, magar pls note, they never acknowledge her not even a mention of her name in praising the trailer, last I heard Taapsee ji said Kangana needs a double filter and Tapsee ji you need to stop being a sasti copy https://t.co/5eRioUxPic— Rangoli Chandel (@Rangoli_A) July 3, 2019Come on Rangoli.. this is going too far.. this is really really desperate.. I really don’t know what to say to this . Having worked with both your sister and Taapsee .. I just don’t get this ..praising the trailer means praising all aspect of it. Which includes Kangana https://t.co/tkG5KwyFHi— Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72) July 3, 2019Also, Taapsee explained about the incident where she said Kangana needs ‘double filter.’ The Badla actor said that Kangana is the one who needs a brain-to-mouth-filter. Also, she stated that she never meant it in a derogatory manner. Taapsee said, “We are both opinionated and speak our mind which is a good thing except that sometimes it lands us in trouble. I had said it in a positive manner and not meant for it to be derogatory. In fact, I have often said Kangana’s an actor I look up to, my conscience is clear. It was weird to target me, that’s why it backfired.” Taapsee had praised the trailer of Judgmentall Hai Kya, post which Rangoli called her 'sasti copy.'This is so cool!!!! Always had high expectations out of this one n this looks so worth it ! #JudgementallHaiKya https://t.co/rpZcn7LHmC— taapsee pannu (@taapsee) July 3, 2019Meanwhile, Taapsee is gearing up for two of her big films Mission Mangal and Saand Ki Aankh. While in Mission Mangal, she plays a scientist involved in ISRO’s Mars Mission, in Saand Ki Aankh she plays the role of Prakashi Tomar who is one of the oldest sharpshooters in the country. Both films’ trailers have impressed the audiences and Taapsee is excited for the same. Saand Ki Aankh is helmed by Tushar Hiranandani, while Mission Mangal is directed by Jagan Shakti. Mission Mangal will hit the screens on August 15 and Saand Ki Aankh on October 25, 2019.

927,Stokes didn't ask us to not award 6 overthrows in WC final: Dharmasena,"After a section of British media claimed that all-rounder Ben Stokes wanted umpires to not award England 6 overthrows in the 2019 World Cup final, umpire Kumar Dharmasena has said that no such request was made. Dharmasena further revealed that he apologised to New Zealand captain Kane Williamson the moment he realised he had made a mistake.",CricTracker,"It was another World Cup final for Kumar Dharmasena but this time, he hadn’t seen the best of days. The former Sri Lanka spinner, who is a top umpire in world cricket now, was slammed for awarding six runs to England after a throw from New Zealand’s Martin Guptill went for four overthrow runs after hitting the bat of a diving Ben Stokes at Lord’s on July 14. Former umpire Simon Taufel had later said that Dharmasena should have given five and not six runs to the chasing side. The extra run helped England tie the game and they went on to lift the trophy.Dharmasena, 48, is nicknamed ‘unanduwa’ which roughly means ‘hard worker’ and he has shown his worth in the official’s role in the past. He was also in charge of the final of the World Cup in 2015 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground which also featured New Zealand as the losing side. The Black Caps might find it hard to swallow to fact that Dharmasena’s presence in their finals didn’t see the end results going their way.AdvertisementEngland had needed 15 runs to win off the last over and after Stokes hit a six in the third ball, it was nine required off three. It was then when that overthrow drama took place and Stokes had come up with an apologising gesture after the ball went for four overthrows. Taufel had said that the second run shouldn’t have been added to England’s total since the batsmen (Stokes and Adil Rashid) hadn’t crossed when the fielder had released the throw.Dharmasena later regretted giving the verdict. Speaking to Sunday Island, Sri Lanka, he said: “I made a judgmental call after consulting my colleague Marais Erasmus. It was like calling a no-ball or a wide and I couldn’t consult the third umpire. I was 100 per cent sure that the batsmen had crossed. It looked as if he had almost reached the popping crease.”“I admit that I was wrong. I also admit that the rule has to change.”Dharmasena also had his own take on the rule. “If the ball hits the stumps and goes for four, then it’s fine. But the moment the ball hits the bat or the batsmen, it’s got to be a dead ball.”Meanwhile, a section of the British media had claimed that Stokes even went to the extent of asking the umpires to withdraw the four overthrow runs. Dharmasena rejected this version outright. He even had apologised to New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson the moment he realised that he had made a blunder.",https://www.crictracker.com/kumar-dharmasena-concedes-erring-in-awarding-vital-runs-to-england-denies-ben-stokes-wanted-to-withdraw-overthrow-runs/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Officials said the ship was sailing normally after the robbery.",Reuters,"SEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Pirates attacked a South Korean-flagged cargo ship in the South China Sea early on Monday, stealing thousands of dollars in cash and even the sailors’ shoes, South Korean authorities said. Two people sustained minor injuries when seven pirates boarded the CK Bluebell and made off with $13,000 and belongings including mobile phones, clothes and shoes from the 22-strong crew, officials from the oceans and fisheries ministry said.   Tougher policing has made piracy less frequent on the strategic shipping route in recent years. The dry bulk vessel CK Bluebell had set sail from its anchorage off Singapore on Saturday afternoon, heading northeast for South Korea’s port of Incheon, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data showed.  Korean officials said the ship was sailing normally after the robbery. The incident took place near the Singapore Strait, a busy sea lane that runs past Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said.  Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) said the incident did not take place in city-state’s waters. “The MPA was informed by the Korea Coast Guard that it took place in the South China Sea near Anambas Islands,” a spokesman said.   This month, China’s Ministry of Transport raised its security recommendation for Chinese vessels in the nearby Malacca Strait, between the Malay peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

Iranian state television published images it said showed the CIA officers who were in touch with the suspected spies. There was no immediate comment on the Iranian allegations by the CIA or U.S. officials.    Iran announced in June that it had broken up an alleged CIA spy ring but it was unclear whether Monday’s announcement was linked to the same case.  The announcement comes after three months of spiraling confrontation between Iran and the West that began when new tighter U.S. sanctions took effect in May.  Last week Iran captured a British tanker after Britain’s Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker on July 4. In a statement read on state television, the Ministry of Intelligence said 17 spies were arrested during the Iranian calendar year that ended in March 2019.  “The identified spies were employed in sensitive and vital private sector centers in the economic, nuclear, infrastructure, military and cyber areas... where they collected classified information,” read the ministry statement.

949,Muralitharan picked up 800th Test wicket on career's last ball,"Former Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, the only player in Test cricket history to take 800 wickets, picked up his 800th wicket on the final ball of his Test career. Muralitharan dismissed India's Pragyan Ojha as his 800th Test wicket on July 22, 2010. Notably, Muralitharan is the fastest to pick 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 Test wickets.",Cricket Country,"Muttiah Muralitharan, born April 17, 1972, is without doubt the greatest cricketer produced by Sri Lanka. Arunabha Sengupta looks back at the career of the man who picked up wickets in amounts and rates that were almost preposterous.Through the nineties and the noughties Sri Lanka, that pearl drop suspended in the glistening Indian Ocean, was the enchanted isle of cricket. And Muttiah Muralitharan was Milton’s chimera, lurking amongst the rifted rocks of the emerald island, luring batsmen into the entrance of hell.He was a freak of nature — a chaos, a contradiction and a prodigy rolled into a phenomenon. ‘An impossibility that never entered before into the heart of man to conceive.’He was impossible to fathom, physically and through measurement. Who ever heard of a wrist-spinner who bowled off-breaks! But then nobody heard of a bowler whose wrists could perform remarkable feats of contortion — touching the forearm with the little finger, and rotating the metacarpals through a full 360 degrees. Nobody heard of 67 five-fors and 22 ten-fors in Test cricket. Nobody ever heard of a legend of his stature, targeted throughout his career by umpires and ex-cricketers for his ‘illegal’ action. Yet, he endured all with that omnipresent smile of his.It required all possible commitment, application and elements of greatness to convert a nation at the bottom of the cricketing ladder, an irrefutable minnow, into a top team of the world in less than a decade. It required something magical to achieve that. Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Sanath Jayasuriya, Chaminda Vaas, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene — all of them provided the commitment, application and several varying elements of greatness. Finally, Murali performed the alchemy, the conjuring trick, converting absurd to actuality.There were brilliant soldiers in the Sri Lankan cause, but it was on the shoulders of this Colossus that the side was carried across the borderline between decent and struggling to the frontiers of supremacy.If that seems an exaggeration, please consider the numbers: When it comes to Murali, the wildest eulogies often fall way short of the parameters of greatness.*Murali played another Test and captured 5 more wickets for Rest of the WorldThe table will demonstrate that the other Sri Lankan bowlers did improve with time, but only marginally, following the rates and rationales of reason. It was Murali’s 795 wickets (he got 5 more for Rest of the World) at 22.67 and a logic-defying strike rate of 54.9 that hauled the team by the scruff of the neck and made it world-class.The early daysWhile studying in St. Anthony’s College, Kandy, Murali bowled fast and batted in the middle-order. Those who have enjoyed his brief forays at the wicket down the years will be wistfully wondering of the thrills and spills of his youthful years with the willow. The cricket world will be forever indebted to school coach Sunil Fernando who advised him to switch to off-spin at the age of 14.The early years were somewhat frustrating for the young man. Murali was included in the Sri Lanka A side to tour England in 1991, but returned without a wicket to show for his efforts.It was Murali’s lifelong bitter-sweet connection with Australia that played a part in kick-starting his career. When Australia visited the island in 1992-93, the local boy was chosen to play for Sri Lanka Board President’s XI against the tourists at Kandy. Murali picked up just one wicket for 79 runs, but a batsman of the stature of Allan Border failed to read him. Two weeks down the line, the boy from Kandy was bowling against Australia in the second Test at the Premadasa Stadium. He did not take too many wickets, but the world did get an indication of the eventual turn of events. In Australia’s second innings, he pitched two feet outside the off-stump. Tom Moody, batting on 54, shouldered arms to find his leg-stump pegged back.From his early days, Murali was a prodigious turner of the ball. His supple wrists had a great deal of say in what had until then been a finger-spinner’s craft. Confidence levels rose with each match and in his seventh outing, against South Africa at Moratuwa, he picked up 5 wickets in the innings for the first time. And when he bowled Sri Lanka to a win in Napier with five scalps on a wicket tailor-made for seamers, his powers were apparent to all. Duleep Mendis maintained that he could turn square on concrete, and few doubted it.Hair-raising stuffBy the time he visited Australia in 1995-96, he was a force to reckon with — 78 wickets from 21 Tests at 30.73 — brimming with promise to extend his figures into the realms of folklore. And now suddenly arrived the moment when controversy raised its hairy head, and threatened to stop his career — at what would have been a tenth of his haul of wickets.In the second Test match, the Boxing Day encounter at Melbourne, Arjuna Ranatunga gambled by sending Australia in on a fine pitch. And soon, umpire Darrell Hair called Muralitharan seven times in three overs for throwing. This strong minded, often inflexible, official — whose obstinacy would create the murkiest cricketing history a decade down the line — made his judgment call from the bowler’s end. In the stands sat Ian Meckiff, who retired after being called in Brisbane in 1963. So affected was this old Australian bowler that he left the stands and made for home. Ranatunga made Murali switch ends and he bowled until tea on the second day, and Steve Dunne had little problems with his action. And now, Hair told the Sri Lankans he was ready to call him from square-leg.The tourists were outraged. Things did not help when the Australian Board vetoed their request of a conversation with Hair to find where the problem lay. Ten days later, during a World Series Cup match, Ross Emerson called Murali for throwing.Had the spinner been born on the other side of Palk Strait, he might have been taken off the team and sent to camps to rectify his action. Whether he would have continued his international career is a curiously difficult question. But, captain Ranatunga and the Sri Lankan Board stood solidly behind him. Murali agreed to go through a biomechanical analysis at the University of Western Australia and at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The results convinced ICC that his naturally bent elbow created the ‘optical illusion of throwing’The unbelievable success storyControversy about his action dogged him right through his career. But, in the latter half of the nineties, Murali blossomed into an off-spinner the like of whom the world had never seen before. In 1996, he was a key member of the Lankan team that lifted the World Cup at Lahore, defeating the side with which they seldom saw eye to eye — Australia. In 1997, Murali became the first Sri Lankan bowler to capture 100 Test wickets. Yes, the first bowler from the island to capture 100 wickets. It will be worthwhile to pause here and look back at his final tally of 800 to realise the enormity of the feat in the context of Lankan cricket.In January 1998, Murali scripted his first 10-wicket haul in Test cricket. And later that year, in the one-off Test against England at The Oval, he established himself as an all-time great. Large bright eyes following the flight of the ball in earnest delight, the broad smile perpetually flashing as he ran in over after over, the spinner picked up 16 wickets in the match — including nine in the second innings. The only other wicket in the second innings was a run-out.It was this Test that transformed Murali from a good to a great bowler. Highlights of his 16 wickets were replayed with the title soundtrack from The Man with the Golden Gun playing in the background. Yes, he was as lethal, without being anywhere near that ruthless. When, years later, he broke Shane Warne’s record to become the highest wicket taker in the history of the game, Murali remarked that the Oval Test was the turning point of his career: “Everyone thought I was a good bowler then and I didn’t look back from there.”But, obstacles were in his way. In 1998-99, he was called again, by Ross Emerson, during an ODI against England at the Adelaide Oval. A fuming Ranatunga almost took his team off the ground. Once again Murali was sent for Tests, in England and Australia, and once again he was cleared.And the wickets kept coming — in both formats of the game. Even the batsmen of the sub-continent fell to his guile. Pakistan struggled against him at home and in his backyard. The Indians lost 23 wickets to him in the three Tests of 2001.In the first years of the new century, Murali mastered the doosra. It spun like a sharp, genuine leg-break. According to a few, the doosra made him somewhat less threatening. The ability to deceive the batsman lay in sticking to an off-stump line, keeping them guessing which way the ball would turn. This enabled batsmen to tuck off-breaks easily o the leg side. The huge turn from way outside the off-stick had to be sacrificed to a great extent to keep the surprise element of the doosra intact. And the action involved in the doosra created more furore about the legitimacy of the delivery.However, the wickets kept coming — in heaps, bundles, bushels. Teams budgeted for 20 Murali wickets in a three Test series, and frequently ended up surrendering more. In his 58th Test, Murali crossed 300 wickets, and 14 Tests later 400. Ten days earlier, he had missed out on capturing all 10 wickets in an innings. Russel Arnold had dropped a chance at short-leg following which Vaas got Henry Olonga caught behind. Murali took it with his trademark smile and shrug. In any case, it made him the second bowler since Jim Laker to pick nine in an innings twice.Clearing the TestsMurali captured his 500th wicket in the second Test against Australia in Kandy in March 2004. And again, at the end of the series the legitimacy of the action of his doosra was officially questioned by match referee Chris Broad.Tests followed at the University of Western Australia, in the Department of Human Movement and Exercise Science. Three-dimensional kinematic measurements of Murali’s bowling arm were taken, using an optical motion capture system while he bowled his doosra. After extensive examinations, he was cleared yet again. The researchers recommended a flat rate of 15° tolerable elbow extension as a demarcation point between bowling and throwing. ICC declared the Murali doosra a legal delivery.In another round of biomechanical testing, Murali was filmed bowling with an arm-brace moulded to his right arm. The world saw that Murali’s spin was not altered even with the brace that prevented any bend or flexion of the arm. The jerk in the action was attributed to his unique shoulder rotation and freakish wrist movement.It converted some critics. Some like Dean Jones revised their views, admitting that the action could not exactly be termed ‘chucking’. However, others like Michael Holding, Bishan Bedi, Adam Gilchrist and Martin Crowe have not been convinced.In Australia, crowd continued to heckle him, jeering him with ‘no ball’ calls. Even Prime Minister John Howard somehow put on the cricket expert’s hat in 2004, voicing that there was little doubt that Murali was a ‘chucker’.However, Murali did have enormous support from one voice – feeble with age, but with the weight to drown all the others around the cricket world into depths of insignificance.After Murali had been called by Hair during the Boxing Day Test of 1995, 87-year-old Don Bradman voiced his dissent saying, “Murali, for me, shows perhaps the highest discipline of any spin bowler since the war. He holds all the guile of the trade, but something else too. His slight stature masks a prodigious talent, and what a boon he has been for cricket’s development on the subcontinent. It is with this in mind, and with the game’s need to engage as a world sport, that I found umpire Darrell Hair‘s calling of Murali so distasteful. It was technically impossible for umpire Hair to call Murali from the bowler’s end. Why was his eye not on the foot-fall and crease? I believe Hair’s action — in one over — took the development of world cricket back by ten years. For me, this was the worst example of umpiring that I have witnessed, and against everything the game stands for. Clearly Murali does not throw the ball. No effort in that direction is made or implied by him. His every effort is to direct the ball unto the batsman.”The tumbling recordsMurali continued to bowl, soon passing Courtney Walsh’s world record haul of 519 Test wickets. The feat established him as the first genuinely great cricketer from the island nation, but he had achieved only a fraction of his final spoils.Shane Warne, in a fascinating duel between spinners played out over a decade and a half, overtook Murali while the latter was undergoing a shoulder surgery. But, 90 wickets in 11 Tests in 2006 closed the gap. In December 2007, at Kandy, Murali bowled Paul Collingwood to become the highest wicket taker in Test cricket once again. His 709 wickets had come in 116 Tests, 29 less than Warne.The Test career came to a fairytale conclusion in July 2010. Murali declared that the first Test against India at Galle would be his last. He started the match with 792 wickets, and picked up his customary 5 wickets in India’s first innings. As the visitors followed on, Lasith Malinga ripped through the innings. Murali had picked up just two when VVS Laxman was run out, the ninth wicket to fall. Pragyan Ojha walked in with the champion spinner tantalisingly poised on 799.However, Murali displayed little in terms of nerves. He ran in with his wide smile and expressive eyes, and destiny was etched out for him on the glorious final stretch. After 15 overs — nerve-wracking for all but Murali — Ojha edged and for the 77th time in Tests, caught Mahela Jayawardene bowled Muttiah Muralitharan registered on the scoreboard. The final tally stood on 800, captured at 22.72 at a strike rate of 55. It will perhaps remain unchallenged forever.There are several other records set by the man which look good to last an eternity. With 67 five-fors, he is a good 30 ahead of the next in line — Shane Warne. In home Tests alone, Murali has 45 five-fors from 73 Tests.When it comes to 10 wickets in a match, he has 22 — with Warne following way, way behind with 10. In terms of matches played, he is the fastest to 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650 and 700 wickets, and  trivially so for 750 and 800, being the only bowler to have captured that many. He has 50 or more wickets against every Test playing country. And if we remove run-out from the equation, the most common method of getting out in Test cricket till now has been ‘bowled Muralitharan.’In ODIs, his farewell was not as glorious. After the 1996 triumph, and the 2007 final, Murali bowled in the World Cup title round yet again in 2011, but could not pick up a wicket as India famously won at Wankhede. Yet, his haul of 534 wickets places him at the peak in this format as well. Significantly, his best performance, seven for 30, came in 2000 against the best players of spin bowling — the Indians.Beyond wicketsApart from his freakish elbow, freakish shoulder, freakish wrists — all adding up to his freakish records — Murali can never be thought of without the ever-present smile on his face. It remained permanently on his face when he bowled and continued off the field, nothing, not even the calumnious criticism of his action could not remove it.Success, of the grandest kind, moulded him — making the camera-shy young bowler confident in front of an audience, with a twinkle in the eye and a wry sense of humour. But, his feet remained firmly attached to his humble roots.The heroics with the ball, unparalleled in history as they are, form only a part of the story and legend that surrounds the man. Playing for a country torn apart by civil unrest and ethnic divide, this champion spinner battled on for the team, often the only Tamil in the eleven, a perennial symbol of unification and solidarity. When the Sri Lankan coasts were ravaged by the Tsunami, Murali was among the first to volunteer his services for the devastated.He not only donated money — which is the privilege and often the substitute of conscience for the rich and famous. He did that, building 1024 houses for the homeless. But, he went beyond. He was there with the relief workers, in the very thick of things, putting in real earthy effort, serving food to the victims, a bucket and a ladle in the hands used to twirling the red cricket ball.(Arunabha Sengupta is a cricket historian and Chief Cricket Writer at CricketCountry.

Gill had played two ODIs against New Zealand, scoring 16 runs.",Cricket Country,"The Indian selectors — led by MSK Prasad — finally decided to address the number four conundrum when they sat down to pick the squad for the West Indies tour on Sunday. After struggling through the World Cup without a fixed number four, the five wise men have decided to give Shreyas Iyer a go.READ: All you need to know about Rahul Chahar?Considered as one of the best batting units in the modern era, India failed to produce a number four batsman going into the 2019 World Cup and the tour of West Indies now provides the selectors the perfect opportunity to try and solve the issue with an eye on the 2023 World Cup.While the selectors decided to ignore Iyer for the World Cup, the ploy of experimenting at that position flopped. Coming into the Windies series, it was always going to be a competition between Shubman Gill and Iyer for that position. Both the batsmen are currently in the West Indies with the India A team and have been among runs. Interestingly, skipper Manish Pandey also hit a century in the series, but he is seen more as a number five or six than a number four in the batting line-up.Speaking on Gill’s exclusion, Prasad said: “He was given an opportunity when KL Rahul was out against New Zealand, he will have to wait for his turn.”Batting coach Sanjay Bangar came under the scanner for failing to produce a number four batsman ahead of the showpiece event despite being with the team for quite some time now.Speaking to IANS, a senior BCCI official said that the constant chopping and changing in the middle-order was something that had hurt the Indian team not just in the World Cup, but over the last couple of seasons. And for Bangar to not be able to find a solution is something that reflects poorly on the coach.“It was a constant struggle,” the official said. “While we are all supportive of the players and they had a good tournament with the exception of this bad day in office (in the semi-final against New Zealand), the support staff’s processes and decision-making will surely be scrutinised thoroughly prior to any decision being taken about their future.“The batting coach must have answers for the number 4 question since it is obvious that it was the team management that was asking for certain players to be included.”The Windies tour will provide Prasad and team a chance to try out youngsters in pivotal positions and ensure that the foundation laid is strong with an eye on the 2023 World Cup.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/india-vs-west-indies-2019-shubman-gill-will-have-to-wait-for-his-turn-msk-prasad-871036?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Currently, a basic customs duty of 20% is imposed on imported handsets.",The Financial Express,"Sale of high-end mobile phones in the grey market is causing an estimated loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually to the exchequer, mobile industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association has claimed. The industry body has suggested imposing a maximum customs duty of Rs 4,000 on handsets priced above Rs 20,000 to discourage duty evasion and wipe out the premium for illegal sales. A basic customs duty (BCD) of 20 per cent is imposed on imported handsets at present.“High-end phones that are getting sold in the grey market are estimated to cause a loss of Rs 2,500 crore annually on account of non-payment of basic customs duty (BCD) and also goods and services tax,” India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told PTI.The industry body has requested Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the BCD of 20 per cent should continue but with a cap of Rs 4,000 on mobile phones priced above Rs 20,000, Mohindroo said. The step will wipe out high margins on the illegal sale of high-end handsets and give a boost to legal imports, the ICEA has reasoned.“Revenue impact on this would be an additional duty of Rs 700 crore of BCD approximately, which will get netted off because of the reduction in duty on the legal import. Hence, there will be no net gain or net loss. The GST collection will, however, go up by over Rs 1,000 crore and the market environment will become much cleaner and regularised,” Mohindroo said.The ICEA said that recent budget was focussed on promoting electronics manufacturing in the country with a provision to write off capital expenditure for under section of 35 AD of Income Tax act.“The entire mobile phone and its components manufacturing ecosystem should be brought under the finally notified scheme,” he said.The industry body has requested the government to bring down GST on mobile phone parts to 12 per cent from 18 per cent at present as it is creating an inverted duty structure in the sector.The GST on mobile phones is 12 per cent while 18 per cent on parts such as back covers, batteries, headphones etc. Mohindroo said that the inverted duty structure has led to a serious cash flow issue for manufacturers and is adversely impacting the competitiveness of locally-produced mobile phones.India had two mobile phone factories in 2014 but now, it has 268 factories engaged in the manufacturing of mobile phones and their accessories. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 13th India-Japan annual summit had announced making India top mobile phone manufacturing destination.Though there is a mechanism in GST to provide a refund of input tax credit (ITC), there is no way to provide a refund of accumulated ITC on the GST paid on capital goods and services in case of inverted structure. “All new manufacturers are investing heavily on Capex (capital expenditure) and business promotion for creating a brand image. GST on such expense is an additional cost to the manufacturer, as they are not allowed refund of such accumulated credit,” Mohindroo said.The ICEA has urged the finance minister to reduce timeframe for refund of GST credits to at most a week. The industry body has also demanded input credit on manufacturing plant or shed, and canteen service, among others.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

At times it felt just like play good cricket and play a bit of Test cricket – absorb some pressure and rebuild at times. It was good to go through different circumstances and have some success.”Waugh has been roped in by Cricket Australia to mentor their team for the Ashes 2019 that gets underway from August 1. While it’s still uncertain whether Carey will be able to break into the Test squad, he nevertheless is going to make the full use of the opportunity to soak in as much knowledge from Waugh.“Having Steve is amazing for the group. I think he’s won nine Ashes … and been over here and played a lot here. To have the knowledge of Steve Waugh, one of the greatest Australian cricketers, be a part of this group is something we’re really lucky to have,” he said.He continued, “Personally, I just had a quick chat just getting to know Steve.

967,Most mob lynching cases are fake: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi,Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Sunday said that most cases of mob lynching in the country are concocted and fake. Naqvi was responding to a question about Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's statement of Muslims being punished for not migrating to Pakistan after 1947. Congress's Randeep Surjewala criticised Naqvi saying BJP is trying to shield culprits.,The Quint,"Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told India Today on Sunday, 21 July that most of the cases of lynching are fakeThis was in response to India Today’s question on Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan’s statement of Muslims “serving a sentence” after the Partition.Khan had said, “If Muslims went to Pakistan, they would not get this punishment. Why our ancestors did not go to Pakistan? They regarded India as their own country. Now they will be punished and they will have to endure,” adding that the Muslims of this country had been living a very “disgusting life”.Naqvi’s statement’s was criticised by senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala who accused the BJP of protecting the accused.Quoting Surjewala, India Today reported, “BJP doesn’t feel anything for the minorities. Everyone in the ruling party is trying to shield the culprits.”Since 2015, 98 people have been victims of mob lynchings across India. According to Indiaspend, 84% of the victims of lynchings due to cow-related violence were Muslims.Naqvi isn’t alone when it comes to downplaying cases of mob lynchings.Recently, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar told The Print that the Saran lynching incident of two tribal men and a Muslim man shouldn’t be viewed as a case of “mob lynching” as three victims “had been caught stealing cattle”.Kumar told The Print, “It is an unfortunate incident. But it should not be seen as mob lynching. Those killed were Nats (a Scheduled Tribe group) and those who killed them belong to downtrodden classes. The incident occurred when the three were caught red-handed stealing cattle. It resulted in angry villagers beating them up leading to their deaths. It is basically an incident arising due to local development.”Another minister of the JD(U)-BJP state government said that it was a case of “law and order” since the victims weren’t forced to chant Jai Shri Ram.(Good news!

He further said that he'll never regret the decision.",CricTracker,"It’s been a week since the 2019 World Cup final has finished but many are still busy discussing the game. Undoubtedly, it was the best ODI game ever played and irrespective of the result, both England and New Zealand should be proud of themselves for the effort they put in. But some crunch moments decided the game eventually and one of them was the umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarding six runs to England in the last over of the chase when the ball ricocheted off Ben Stokes’ bat.The incident took place in the final over when the home team needed nine runs off three balls and the Kiwis almost had the World Cup trophy in the bag. The batsman swatted the ball to deep mid-wicket and set off for two runs. While taking the second run, Stokes dived to avoid getting run-out only for his bat to deflect the ball to the boundary.AdvertisementThe on-field umpires consulted then to give England six runs when actually five runs should’ve signalled. According to the cricketing laws, the two batsmen should’ve crossed each other when the fielder threw the ball and Stokes and Adil Rashid hadn’t crossed when Martin Guptill fired in a throw. It was considered as a clear mistake by the former international umpire Simon Taufel.Speaking about the controversial call to a Sri Lankan publication the Sunday Times, Kumar Dharmasena has cleared that he has no regrets about the decision he made regarding the overthrow. However, he also admitted that they made a judgemental error in the middle.“It’s easy for people to comment after seeing TV replays. I agree that there was a judgmental error when I see it on TV replays now. But we did not have the luxury of TV replays at the ground and I will never regret the decision I made. Besides, the ICC praised me for the decision I made at that time,” he said.Dharmasena also cleared that he communicated to the leg umpire Marais Erasmus before making the decision and even the other umpires agreed to give six runs to England. “There is no provision in the law to refer this to the third umpire as no dismissal was involved. So, I did consult the leg umpire through the communication system which is heard by all other umpires and the match referee.“And, while they cannot check TV replays, they all confirmed that the batsmen have completed the run. This is when I made my decision,” the 48-year-old added.",https://www.crictracker.com/i-will-never-regret-the-decision-i-made-says-kumar-dharmasena-on-the-controversial-overthrow-in-the-world-cup-final/

I do not think apart from the Gandhi family, anyone should be elected as the president,"" Singh added.Around 50 days after Rahul stepped down as Congress president, taking moral responsibility for the humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, the grand old party is yet to finalize its new chief.Gandhi, now a lawmaker from Wayanad in Kerala, became the Congress president in 2017. He had, earlier this month, written a lengthy four-page letter making his resignation from the post public. Taking responsibility for the drubbing in Lok Sabha polls, Rahul had said it would not be right for him to suggest a successor.At present Congress in Goa has completely lost foot, after 10 of its MLAs switched side with the BJP. This has reduced its strength to five in the Assembly.Similarly, in Karnataka, the situation is equally embarrassing for the party, as its coalition government with JD(S) is facing a tough time. The government had slumped into a crisis following the resignation of 16 dissident MLAs and now its survival seems to be tough.The Congress won 52 seats in the recent general elections, which is just eight more than its 2014 Lok Sabha tally of 44.

997,Agencies gave IL&FS good ratings despite stress flags: Audit,"A Grant Thornton audit into debt-laden IL&FS Group revealed that rating agencies despite flagging financial stress before its default, continued to give it and its units ""consistently high"" credit ratings. It said officials of agencies including ICRA, CARE, Brickwork and India Ratings, were possibly given gifts like smartwatches and overseas sports event tickets to influence the ratings.",Reuters,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Credit rating agencies for years assigned high ratings to India’s Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) and its group companies despite its deteriorating finances, according to a special audit. Audit firm Grant Thornton was appointed by IL&FS’ new board to conduct the review following the government’s decision to take charge of the group after its defaults on debt obligations sparked fears of financial contagion.  Grant Thornton reviewed the role of five credit rating agencies — Fitch group’s India Ratings and Research, the Indian affiliate of Moody’s, ICRA, Standard & Poor’s local unit Crisil, CARE Ratings and Brickwork Ratings India — which assigned 429 ratings to various IL&FS financial instruments in recent years. In a 105-page report, reviewed by Reuters on Saturday, Grant Thornton said the agencies raised multiple concerns on IL&FS group’s financial stress and liquidity position between June 2012 and June 2018, but continued to assign “consistently high” ratings which were only downgraded or reversed last year. “Various strategies deployed by the then key officials of IL&FS group and certain favours/gifts provided to rating agency officials suggest the possible reasons for consistent good ratings provided to IL&FS group,” said Grant Thornton in its report that detailed gifts or favours such as smartwatches and tickets to overseas sporting events.  IL&FS declined to comment. India Ratings said the Grant Thornton report is based on “partial and selective source material”, adding “our ratings were based on robust and transparent analysis of relevant information”. Brickwork said it did not assign the highest ratings to IL&FS “because it follows robust, transparent and consistent rating methodology” and its actions were not influenced by any commercial pressures or rating withdrawal requests. ICRA said it will determine an appropriate course of action and was examining the report, which it said ignores the “alleged fraud perpetrated by former IL&FS management”. Crisil and CARE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     The IL&FS crisis that started last year has sparked a series of federal probes into the firm’s operations, but Grant Thornton’s report raises questions on whether rating agencies misled investors about the stress levels at other companies in India’s shadow banking sector, where new fractures are emerging. Dewan Housing Finance Corp, another top firm in the sector, last week warned its financial situation was dire, raising more worries about the sector’s health and signalling the crisis was far from over. “These instances show a glimpse into the incestuous financial services industry where quid pro quo has become the norm. The rot ... is deep and needs more cleansing,” said Shriram Subramanian, a corporate governance expert at proxy advisory firm InGovern.  Grant Thornton’s review of communication between former IL&FS employees and ratings agencies found the company at times “used to potentially pressurize” rating firms to withdraw their assessment if the company did not receive a favourable rating. It also found instances where credit rating agencies would meet with IL&FS employees and then decide not to downgrade the ratings they had initially decided on, the report said. “It appears that various potential strategies noted above were applied to ensure favorable ratings or to avoid the rating downgrade,” Grant Thornton said. Highlighting “potential favours/gifts”, Grant Thornton said various key officials at rating agencies received gifts such as smartwatches, shirts and coasters. E-mail communication showed a former IL&FS employee had facilitated the purchase of a villa at a steep discount for the wife of a senior Fitch executive, while another had arranged football tickets for a Brickwork Ratings executive to a Real Madrid game, the report added.

When he was not included in the primary squad but named as a back-up he put out the famous 3D tweet. Later when the selectors had to name replacement players, Rayudu was still not included and it was said that the reason could’ve been his tweet. However, selector MSK Prasad disagrees.When Prasad announced the India squads for West Indies tour, he was asked about Rayudu who retired from all forms of the sport after the snubs. He clarified that the selection committee was only making replacement changes based on the team management’s requirements and on that basis he didn’t find a place. There was no sort of bias in the decision-making and that they too got emotional as Rayudu retired.AdvertisementThe chairman of selectors also mentioned that they had brought Rayudu in the ODI team based on his T20I performance amidst criticism and gave him enough opportunities to cement a spot. Moving forward based on his performance and the combination of the team he couldn’t be included in the World Cup squad.They persisted with him even after the middle-order batsman failed the yo-yo test. He was put on a fitness program at the NCA and they made sure he cleared it at the next go to be a part of the Indian team.“There was criticism when we picked Rayudu after his 2017-18 T20 form. When he failed the fitness test, we backed him. Due to some combinations and permutations, we didn’t pick him for the World Cup. We didn’t do anything against him,” MSK said.Rayudu’s 3D tweet got really popular and also proved to be meme material. The common perception was that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials, the team management as well as the selectors were not happy with his tweet. The Hyderabadi was one of the few Indian players who ever questioned their selection or non-selection on social media or a public platform.However, Prasad said that he saw humour in the tweet and really enjoyed the sarcasm in it since it was timely.“Ambati Rayudu tweet was lovely.

Hammond’s decision underlines the strength of feeling in parliament against a no-deal Brexit, which some lawmakers and many businesses say would be catastrophic for the economy. A loyal Conservative who has served in a number of ministerial roles, Hammond is an unlikely rebel. He said his fears over a no deal forced him to vote against the government for the first time in his 22-year political career last week. Britain’s new prime minister is tipped to be former London mayor Johnson, who has promised to leave the EU “do or die” by an Oct. 31 deadline. That leaves him facing a tricky Brexit challenge from the moment he would take office on Wednesday. Johnson has said he would ramp up preparations for a no deal to try to force the EU’s negotiators to make changes to the agreement that Prime Minister Theresa May sealed with Brussels and UK lawmakers voted down three times.  But parliamentary opposition to a no deal is growing and the EU is refusing to budge over that withdrawal agreement. “I am sure I am not going to be sacked because I am going to resign before we get to that point,” Hammond told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, adding he would resign to May before she tendered her own resignation to the Queen on Wednesday. “Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal (EU) exit on the 31st of October. That is not something I could ever sign up to.” Johnson has said his most senior ministers “would have to be reconciled” with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, a departure he does not want to see happen, but one he says must be planned for to try to increase pressure on the EU. That stance means several more ministers who want to leave with a deal may seek to quit before facing the prospect of being sacked by Johnson. Justice minister David Gauke has indicated he will also step down on Wednesday, and some lawmakers say they expect more pro-EU Conservatives to leave their positions to hold talks in parliament to find a way to prevent a no deal. Keir Starmer, Brexit policy chief in the main opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter he respected Hammond’s decision. “I want to work with all those MPs (members of parliament) who, like me, want to ensure parliament can stop a disastrous no-deal exit,” Starmer said. Hammond’s intention to resign led Ian Blackford, the Westminster leader of the Scottish National Party, to predict that Johnson could become “the shortest serving prime minister in history”. Hammond, who according to sources close to Johnson often infuriated the former mayor who felt the finance minister was “talking Britain down”, said he did not believe his former colleague could win a deal with the EU by the deadline.  He instead advised the new prime minister to ask the EU for a little longer if there were signs that the two sides could agree on a compromise position - something Johnson’s rival for the premiership, Jeremy Hunt, has said he is open to. But the EU has so far been steadfast in its view that it cannot open the withdrawal agreement, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said both sides would be “in trouble” if the new prime minister was intent on tearing up the deal. He suggested the new leader could secure changes to the political declaration on future ties to get rid of the Northern Irish backstop - an insurance policy to avoid the return of a hard border between the British province and Ireland. “We hope that the backstop that many in the UK don’t seem to like can be avoided,” Coveney told the BBC. “(But) we are simply not going to move away from that withdrawal agreement.” Johnson and his supporters say the hardline stance is little more than a negotiating ploy. But if the standoff failed to be broken and a no deal Brexit was in the offing, Hammond would become a high-profile backer of attempts in parliament to stop a no deal. “Yes, (I will campaign) to stop no deal happening on Oct. 31 without the consent of parliament,” Hammond said. “I want to be a loyal supporter of the next Conservative government and if (it).. can deliver a negotiated Brexit deal that protects our economy then I will strongly support that government. And I hope I will be able to.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; editing by John Stonestreet",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-hammond/uk-finance-minister-hammond-to-resign-on-wednesday-over-no-deal-brexit-idUSKCN1UG0B4?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Earlier today at San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel Studios' chief Kevin Feige announced the full slate of Phase 4 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Without a doubt, the biggest announcement amongst all the films was Thor 4 titled Thor: Love and Thunder. Being a part of the MCU's Holy Trinity that also comprised of Iron Man and Captain America, Thor is also one of the OG Avengers. With Tony and Steve gone, Thor is the biggest superhero of MCU, so it is quite natural that Thor: Love and Thunder is already the most awaited film.With Taika Waititi, who made Thor a fan favourite with his take in Thor: Ragnarok, returning to write and direct the fourth part, Thor: Love and Thunder had garnered a massive hype but the new details that were revealed at the Comic-Con earlier today have left all the fans in a state of frenzy! Thor: Love and Thunder will star Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson and will mark the return of Thor's love interest Dr Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. The twist in the tale is that Jane Foster will be seen worthy of lifting Mjolnir in Thor: Love and Thunder and will take the mantle of Thor. The plot device is based on the recent comic book storyline where Thor loses his powers and Jane Foster is deemed worthy. At the Comic-Con panel, director Taika Waititi called Natalie on stage and handed her the Mjolnir in the presence of Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson and thousands of fans. He said, ""That storyline is incredible is full emotion, love and thunder and introduces for the first time female Thor"".Lifting the Mjolnir, Natalie was heard saying, ""I’ve always had hammer envy"".

1038,US-S Korea military exercise to proceed despite N Korea's warning,"The secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Jong Kun Choi, has said a US-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month. This comes despite North Korea's warning that the exercise will put talks aimed at getting the country to abandon its nuclear weapons at risk. ""The nature of exercise isn't offensive,"" Choi said.",Reuters,"ASPEN, Colo. (Reuters) - A top South Korean official on Saturday said a U.S.-South Korean military exercise would go ahead as planned next month, denying Pyongyang’s charges that holding it would breach an agreement made between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “The nature of the exercise is not offensive ... and is for strengthening the alliance,” Choi Jong-kun, the secretary for peace planning to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, told the Aspen Institute’s annual strategic forum. Later, speaking with Reuters, Choi said next month’s exercise would largely involve computer simulations and not troops in the field. The spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Trump had reaffirmed in a meeting with Kim last month that joint exercises would be halted adding that the U.S. decision to proceed with them was “clearly a breach” of the leaders’ agreements made at a summit in Singapore last year. The spokesman said proceeding with war games was jeopardizing Pyongyang’s resumption of nuclear talks with the United States. The ministry said Washington’s pattern of “unilaterally reneging on its commitments” was leading Pyongyang to its commitment to discontinue tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the North Korean charges earlier this week. Speaking to the Aspen conference, Choi said that the United States would have consulted with his government had Trump agreed to suspend U.S.-South Korean war games during his talks last month with Kim on the border last month. “As far as I know, President Trump did not promise the cancellation of this upcoming military exercise,” said Choi. “If he had done that ... we would have been consulted and organized it and used it very strategically.” He noted that the United States and South Korea had suspended a large-scale exercise and canceled a second following the Singapore summit in June 2018 at which Trump sought to persuade Kim to end the development of nuclear weapons and eliminate his arsenal.  A second Trump-Kim summit in February failed to make any headway. The following month, the U.S. and South Korean militaries announced they were scaling back major war games - which Pyongyang long has denounced as preparations for war - and would hold smaller-scale exercises. Even so, Choi said, the preparedness of the U.S. and South Korean military to operate together had not been waned. “For the record, military interoperability has never been compromised,” he said.

1040,Iran releases video of British-flagged oil tanker's capture,"Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has released a video showing British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero's capture. The video shows speedboats pulling up alongside the tanker, and troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns being lowered onto its deck from a helicopter. The same tactics were used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian oil tanker two weeks ago.",Reuters,"GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Saturday denounced Iran’s seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf as a “hostile act” and rejected Tehran’s explanation that it seized the vessel because it had been involved in an accident. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards posted a video online showing speedboats pulling alongside the Stena Impero tanker, its name clearly visible. Troops wearing ski masks and carrying machine guns rappelled to its deck from a helicopter, the same tactics used by British Royal Marines to seize an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar two weeks ago. Friday’s action in the global oil trade’s most important waterway has been viewed in the West as a major escalation after three months of confrontation that has already taken Iran and the United States to the brink of war. It follows threats from Tehran to retaliate for Britain’s July 4 seizure of the Iranian tanker Grace 1, accused of violating sanctions on Syria. British Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt called the incident a “hostile act”. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had expressed “extreme disappointment” by phone to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Britain also summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires in London. A spokesman for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Brigadier-General Ramezan Sharif, said Tehran had seized the ship in the Strait of Hormuz despite the “resistance and interference” of a British warship which had been escorting it. No British warship was visible in the video posted by the Guards. Iran’s Fars news agency said the Guards had taken control of the Stena Impero on Friday after it collided with an Iranian fishing boat whose distress call it ignored. The vessel, carrying no cargo, was taken to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. It will remain there with its 23 crew - 18 of them Indians - while the accident is investigated, Iranian news agencies quoted the head of Ports and Maritime Organisation in southern Hormozgan province, Allahmorad Afifipour, as saying. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Britain said the tanker was approached by Iranian forces when it was in Omani territorial waters exercising its lawful right of passage, and the action “constitutes illegal interference.” “Current tensions are extremely concerning, and our priority is to de-escalate. We do not seek confrontation with Iran,” the letter said. “But it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to threaten shipping going about its legitimate business through internationally recognized transit corridors.” Zarif told Hunt that the ship must go through a legal process before it can be released, Iran’s ISNA news agency reported. The strait, between Iran and the Arabian peninsula, is the sole outlet for exports of most Middle Eastern oil, and the seizure sent oil prices sharply higher. The United States, which tightened sanctions against Iran in May with the aim of halting its oil exports altogether, has been warning for months of an Iranian threat to shipping in the strait. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he also discussed the situation with Hunt, his British counterpart. “We talked about what they’ve seen, what they know, and how they’re beginning to think about how they will respond,” Pompeo said in an interview with the Washington Examiner that was published on Saturday by the State Department. “Iran is in a place today that they have taken themselves.” Another oil tanker, the Mesdar, was also boarded by Iranian personnel on Friday and temporarily forced to divert toward Iran, but later was allowed to continue on its route through the strait. On Saturday Algeria’s APS news agency said the Mesdar was owned by Algeria’s state oil company Sonatrach. France, Germany and the European Union joined Britain in condemning the seizure. The three big European countries are signatories to a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that Washington undermined by quitting last year, setting Iran’s already fragile relations with the West on a downward spiral. Under the pact, Iran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for lifting sanctions. The European countries opposed the Trump administration’s decision to abandon the agreement last year, but have so far failed to fulfill promises to Iran of providing alternative means for it to access world trade. “Just spoke to ... Zarif and expressed extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate situation, they have behaved in the opposite way,” Hunt wrote on Twitter. “This has to be about actions not words if we are to find a way through.”  Earlier he said London’s reaction would be “considered but robust” and it would ensure the safety of its shipping. On Friday, Hunt said the solution would be found via diplomacy and London was “not looking at military options.” Britain’s government said it had advised British shipping to stay out of the Hormuz area for an interim period. During the past three months of escalation, the United States and Iran come as close as ever to direct armed conflict. In June, Tehran shot down a U.S. drone and President Donald Trump ordered retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off just minutes before were to have been carried out. The vessel had been heading to a port in Saudi Arabia and suddenly changed course after passing through the strait. The United States has blamed Iran for a series of attacks on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran has rejected the allegations. Washington also said it had this week downed an Iranian drone near where the Stena Impero was seized.  The United States is sending military personnel and resources to Saudi Arabia for the first time since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Tiangong-2 was relatively small for a space station (when measured against the ISS), consisting of just a research module with enough space on board for only two astronauts.After about 1,000 days in space, Tiangong-2 had exceeded its planned lifespan, and China’s space agency planned this de-orbit — in contrast to Tiangong-1’s de-orbit last year, which was not planned (though ultimately not a risk to anyone on the ground, either).
