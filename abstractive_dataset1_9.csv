India imported 39.66 tonnes of gold in July, compared to 88.16 tonnes of gold in the year-ago period, reports said. The government had in Budget 2019-20 announced hiking import duty on gold from 10% to 12.5%.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India�s gold imports in July plunged 55% from a year ago to the lowest level in three years as a rally in local prices to a record high and a hike in import taxes curtailed demand, a government source said on Monday. Lower purchases by the world�s second biggest consumer could cap gains in global prices that jumped to the highest level in over 6-years on Monday, but help the south Asian country in bringing down the trade deficit and supporting rupee. India imported 39.66 tonnes of gold in July, down from 88.16 tonnes a year ago, the source said, who was not allowed to speak to the media. In value terms, the country�s imports in the month fell 42% to $1.71 billion, he said. Local gold prices jumped to record high last month tracking gains in overseas market and as New Delhi raised import taxes on the precious metal to 12.5% from 10% earlier. The surprise hike in the import tax and price rise badly affected demand last month, said Mukesh Kothari, director at dealer RiddiSiddhi Bullions in Mumbai. �Even in August, imports would be much lower than last year. Demand is not improving,� he said. On Monday, local gold futures rose more than 2% to hit an all-time high of 37,149 rupees ($524.97) per 10 grams, taking their gains to more than 17% in 2019. �As retail demand has dried up, jewellers are placing import orders with banks,� said a Mumbai-based dealer with a bullion importing bank. India�s gold demand is likely to soften in the September quarter as record high local prices curtails buying,  the World Gold Council said last week. On Monday, dealers were offering a discount of up to $36 an ounce over official domestic prices, the highest since August 2016. The domestic price includes a 12.5% import tax and 3% sales tax. Scrap supplies have been increasing as the price rise has been prompting many people to sell their old ornaments, said a bullion dealer based in southern city of Chennai, adding �Old supplies are further reducing import requirements.� ($1 = 70.7640 Indian rupees) Reporting by Aftab Ahmed and Rajendra Jadhav; editing by David Evans",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-imports/indias-july-gold-imports-hit-three-year-low-on-record-prices-government-source-idINKCN1UV0ZZ?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6611,Trump freezes all Venezuelan government assets in US,US President Donald Trump on Monday issued an executive order imposing a freeze on Venezuelan government assets in the US. The move is reportedly aimed at forcing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of the office over human rights abuses. The US has recognised Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the countrys legitimate president and imposed sanctions on the Maduro regime.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a freeze on all Venezuelan government assets in the United States on Monday, sharply escalating an economic and diplomatic pressure campaign aimed at removing socialist President Nicolas Maduro from power. The executive order signed by Trump goes well beyond the sanctions imposed in recent months against Venezuela�s state-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and the country�s financial sector, as well as measures against dozens of Venezuelan officials and entities. Trump�s action, the toughest yet against Maduro, not only bans U.S. companies from dealings with the Venezuela government but also appears to open the door to possible sanctions against foreign firms or individuals that assist it. Russian and Chinese companies are among those still doing significant business in the South American OPEC nation. �All property and interests in property of the Government of Venezuela that are in the United States ... are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in,� according to the executive order released by the White House. The scope of the announcement came as a surprise even to some Trump administration allies. �This is big,� said Ana Quintana, senior policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank. Quintana said it appeared the order would be a sweeping embargo on doing business with Venezuela, although she was awaiting further details. Venezuela�s Information Ministry did not respond immediately to a request to comment. The United States and most Western nations have called for Maduro to step down and have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country�s legitimate president. Guaido, accused by Maduro of mounting a U.S.-directed coup attempt, appointed a board for Citgo Petroleum, Venezuela�s most important foreign asset, earlier this year. Trump said on Thursday he was considering a quarantine or blockade of Venezuela, although he did not elaborate at the time on when or how such a blockade would be imposed. He is taking more dramatic action after numerous rounds of sanctions failed to turn Venezuela�s military against Maduro or make significant progress in dislodging him.  U.S. officials have long said they had other weapons in their economic arsenal, even as they privately expressed frustration that European partners and others had not taken stronger steps and that the months-long pressure campaign had not made more headway. Trump said in a letter to Congress the freezing of assets was necessary �in light of the continued usurpation of power by the illegitimate Nicolas Maduro regime, as well as the regime�s human rights abuses, arbitrary arrest and detention of Venezuelan citizens, curtailment of free press, and ongoing attempts to undermine Interim President Juan Guaido.� His executive order also threatened sanctions against anyone assisting Maduro or his loyalists, suggesting that Washington could resort to so-called secondary sanctions against third-country companies and individuals. Fernando Cutz, a former top Trump adviser on Latin America, said the executive order could be applied to non-U.S. firms and entities, limiting their ability to do business with Venezuela if they wanted to continue to deal with U.S. companies or banks. China and Russia continue to trade oil with Venezuela. The move could escalate tensions with China, already inflamed by a tit-for-tat trade war, said Cutz, now a senior associate with the Cohen Group, a consulting firm. China and Russia - together with Cuba - have continued to back Maduro, prompting U.S. national security adviser John Bolton to warn Beijing and Moscow on Monday against doubling down in their support for him. Bolton is slated to give a speech on Tuesday morning at a gathering of more than 50 countries in Lima, Peru, that would outline a planned U.S. initiative to lead to a peaceful transfer of power in Venezuela. Moscow and Beijing turned down invitations to attend. A White House official declined to comment on the implications of the order for foreign companies doing business in Venezuela, where an economic crisis has driven more than 3 million people to emigrate, fleeing hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Trump�s order allows exceptions for the delivery of food, medicine and clothing �intended to be used to relieve human suffering.� Reporting by Makini Brice, Eric Beech, Matt Spetalnick, Roberta Rampton and Lesley Wroughton; Additional reporting by Angus Berwick in CARACAS; Editing by Sandra Maler and Paul Tait",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-usa-order/trump-freezes-all-venezuelan-government-assets-in-bid-to-pressure-maduro-idUSKCN1UW03C?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6612,Drought reveals Thai temple submerged by dam,"A Buddhist temple in Thailand submerged due to a dam has been exposed after water level in the reservoir reached less than 3% of its capacity due to drought. Wat Nong Bua Yai, a modern temple was submerged due to dam's construction 20 years ago. Thousands arrived at the site to pay their respects to the headless 4-metre-tall Buddha statue.",Reuters,"LOPBURI, Thailand (Reuters) - Thousands are flocking to see a Buddhist temple in central Thailand exposed after drought drove water levels to record lows in a dam reservoir where it had been submerged.  As the reservoir reaches less than 3% of capacity, the remains of Wat Nong Bua Yai, a modern temple submerged during construction of the dam 20 years ago, have became visible in the middle of dry ground. Some Buddhist monks were among the hundreds of people who walked through broken temple structures on cracked earth littered with dead fish last week to pay respects to a headless 4-metre (13-feet) -tall Buddha statue, adorning it with flowers. �The temple is normally covered by water. In the rainy season you don�t see anything,� said one of the visitors, Somchai Ornchawiang, a 67-year-old retired teacher. He regretted the temple flooding but is now worried about the damage the drought is causing to farmland, he added. The dam, with capacity of 960 million cubic meters, normally  irrigates more than 1.3 million acres (526,000 hectares)of farmland in four provinces, but drought has cut that to just 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares) in the single province of Lopburi. The meteorological department says Thailand is facing its worst drought in a decade, with water levels in dams nationwide having fallen far short of the monthly average. Yotin Lopnikorn, 38, headman of the Nong Bua village that used to be near the temple, recalls visiting it with friends as a child, before dam construction forced the villagers out. �When I was young, I always came to meet friends at the elephant sculptures in front of the main building to play there,� Yotin said. At the time, the temple was the centre of the community, used to conduct rituals, festivities and educational activities, besides functioning as a playground and recreational area. Next to the temple compound are the remains of 700 households of the village. The ruins have reappeared before, after a drought in 2015. �This is the second time I have seen this temple in this condition,� said Yotin. �Now I think we need to save this place.� Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Karishma Singh and Clarence Fernandez",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-drought-temple/drought-reveals-lost-temple-in-thailand-submerged-by-dam-idUSKCN1UW023?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6614,No truce yet: IndiGo Co-Founder Gangwal on rift with Bhatia,"IndiGo Co-Founder Rakesh Gangwal has refuted the media reports claiming an agreement has been reached with Co-Founder Rahul Bhatia on governance and related party transaction (RPT) issues. Gangwal said that while the contractual language for new RPT policy and board structure was agreed upon, there's a ""large loophole"" in the proposed board size giving Bhatia's IGE Group even more powers.",Reuters,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - A co-founder of India�s biggest airline IndiGo, Rakesh Gangwal, said reports that a truce had been brokered between him and another co-founder Rahul Bhatia over disagreements on corporate governance were �false and misleading.� In a letter here dated Aug. 5, Gangwal told the board of IndiGo's parent InterGlobe Aviation Ltd that issues between him and Bhatia remained unresolved. Gangwal last month alleged violations of corporate governance rules at InterGlobe, calling for India�s securities regulator to intervene. At the centre of Gangwal�s complaint were Bhatia-controlled IGE Group�s significant controlling rights over IndiGo, which he alleged allows them to carry out �questionable� transactions. In the latest letter, disclosed by InterGlobe to exchanges on Tuesday, Gangwal said he did not back a proposal by the airline to expand its board of directors to 10, arguing that it would benefit IGE and help it �rework and dilute� an agreed-upon policy on related-party transactions. InterGlobe lost almost $1 billion in market value on July 10 after Gangwal disclosed his complaint to regulators, although the shares have recouped most of those losses since then. The stock rose around 2% on July 24 after the Economic Times reported here that InterGlobe Chairman M. Damodaran had brokered a truce between the co-founders. Under Gangwal and Bhatia, IndiGo has grown rapidly since it launched flights in 2006 and now controls a near 50% share of the Indian domestic aviation market. IndiGo, Asia�s most valuable budget airline by market capitalisation, has also accelerated international expansion plans since Jet Airways, once India�s largest private carrier, collapsed in April.

The IHS Markit India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in July rose above the 50-mark threshold, which separates expansion from contraction, to touch 53.8. In June, the PMI had contracted for the first time in a year at 49.6.",BloombergQuint,"The country's services sector activity in July returned to growth territory driven by new business orders that rose at fastest pace since October 2016, following which job creation picked up, a monthly survey showed on Monday.The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index rose to 53.8 in July from 49.6 in June, pointed to the quickest increase in output in one year. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.""PMI data indicated that the strongest upturn in new work for nearly three years led to a rebound in business activity,"" said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit. Survey respondents linked the upturn in business activity to a promising government budget, strengthening demand and new client wins.New businesses have been secured from the public and private sectors, as well as domestic and international markets, they said, adding that new export work rose for the fifth straight month in July. ""These favourable results from the service sector were accompanied by improved momentum among goods producers, which combined showed the sharpest rise in output for eight months,"" Lima said.Meanwhile, the IHS Markit India Composite PMI Output Index, that maps both the manufacturing and services industry, touched an eight-month high of 53.9 in July from 50.8 in June, as aggregate new orders rose to the greatest extent since last November. Moreover, job creation picked up to the strongest since early-2011 in response to strengthening demand conditions and upbeat predictions for the economic outlook.""India's labour market continues to go from strength-to-strength, with the pace of service sector job creation, the highest in over eight years. Ongoing expansions in the employment base should support household spending and consumer confidence in the near-term,"" Lima said.The survey further noted that the July data indicated an improvement in business optimism across the service economy and companies expect advertising efforts and strengthening market conditions to support growth in the coming 12-month period.Experts believe that the Reserve Bank of India will continue with its dovish stance in the policy review meet that kicked off on Monday to boost slowing economic growth.

Prior to today's announcement, GoWork had raised an undisclosed amount from Nimitaya fund. GoWork plans to establish 50 centres across several major Indian cities by 2025.",TechCrunch,"GoWork, a Gurgaon-based startup that runs a co-working spaces business in India, said on Tuesday it has raised $53 million in a debt round to scale its business in the country as competition in the market, including from recent entrant Oyo Rooms, intensifies.The debt round for the two-year-old startup � not to be confused with an Indonesian startup with the same name that operates in the same space � was financed by a private fund managed by BlackRock�s Private Credit team and CLSA Capital Partners� Special Situations Group, the startup said. Prior to today�s announcement, GoWork had raised an undisclosed amount from Nimitaya fund, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.Sudeep Singh, CEO of GoWork, said the startup will use the fresh capital, which will flow for the next two years, to expand its footprints in the country. GoWork plans to establish 50 centers across several major Indian cities by 2025, up from two it currently runs in Gurgaon.In the immediate quarters, it plans to expand its accommodation capacity to 25,000 people, up from 12,000 currently.

6633,"N Korea says will make US, S Korea pay; launches more missiles","North Korea fired missiles into the sea off its east coast for the fourth time in less than two weeks as it protested that joint US-South Korea military drills violated diplomatic agreements. ""If the US and South Korea disregard North Korea's repeated warnings, we will make them pay [a] heavy price,"" a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said.",Reuters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired missiles into the sea off its east coast for the fourth time in less than two weeks, South Korea said on Tuesday, as Pyongyang warned that hostile moves against it �have reached the danger line.� The North, criticizing the U.S.-South Korean drills and their use of high-tech weapons, has fired a series of missiles and rockets since its leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed at a June 30 meeting to revive stalled denuclearization talks. North Korea has said it is committed to diplomacy and it will wait until the end of the year for the United States to soften its policy of sanctions and political pressure over Pyongyang�s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. But if Washington and Seoul disregard North Korea�s repeated warnings, �we will make them pay (a) heavy price,� a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement released through state news agency KCNA.  Trump has played down the tests by saying they did not break any agreement he had with Kim but the talks have yet to resume. Analysts believe the tests are designed both to improve North Korean military capabilities and to pressure Washington to offer more concessions. �Part of what�s happening now is that North Korea is expressing frustrations with a general lack of progress on inter-Korean agenda while increasing leverage in U.S.-North Korea negotiations by demonstrating how its programs could and will continue to advance,� said Jenny Town, managing editor at 38 North, a website that tracks North Korea. South Korea�s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles were fired from near Kwail on North Korea�s west coast, about 125 km (80 miles) southwest of Pyongyang, in South Hwanghae province early on Tuesday. They were the fourth set of launches since July 25.  The missiles flew about 450 km (280 miles) and reached an altitude of 37 km (23 miles), the JCS said. U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies deemed they had similar flight characteristics to the short-range ballistic missiles launched by North Korea on July 25, it said. Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at South Korea�s Kyungnam University, said the latest launch area was significant because the flight path of 450 km meant that all of South Korea was in range of such missiles. �It becomes difficult to detect the origin of the launch in advance because it is capable of launching a missile from most anywhere in North Korea, targeting all of South Korea,� he said. South Korea�s defense ministry said on Tuesday the missile launch went against the spirit of easing tension on the Korean peninsula.  A United Nations report said on Monday Pyongyang has continued to enhance its nuclear and missile programs and used cyberattacks to take in $2 billion to fund the development.  The missile tests represent military advances, as well as help Kim strengthen his bargaining power with the United States, said Van Jackson, a former Pentagon official focused on Korea. �Kim believes he doesn�t need to compromise to get what he wants, doesn�t need to conduct serious negotiations at the working level because he has recourse to Trump, and doesn�t need to restrain any of his missile testing or actions abroad as long as he doesn�t test an intercontinental ballistic missile,� Jackson said. The launches on July 25 were the first since Trump and Kim met at the heavily armed Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas on June 30. What was agreed at that meeting is now under scrutiny. The North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said that the North remained committed to resolving issues through dialogue, but that the United States and South Korea�s joint military drills violate a pledge made by Trump to Kim. Pyongyang �will be compelled to seek a new road as we have already indicated� if South Korea and the United States continue with hostile military moves, he said.  The arrival of new, U.S.-made F-35A stealth fighters in South Korea, the visit of a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine to a South Korean port, and U.S. tests of ballistic missiles are among the steps that have forced North Korea to continue its own weapons development, the spokesman said. �The U.S. and South Korean authorities remain outwardly talkative about dialogue,� he said. �But when they sit back, they sharpen a sword to do us harm.� South Korean media reported that U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises had started on Monday. A senior South Korean official said previously the drills would mainly involve computer simulations.  A JCS spokesman told a regular news briefing on Monday the allies were preparing for a joint exercise in the second half of the year but would not confirm the name of the drill or whether it had already started. The testing of short-range missiles by North Korea is banned by a 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution demanding that North Korea suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program.  Japan�s defense ministry said it did not see any imminent threat to Japanese security from the latest projectile launch by North Korea.

6635,India raises cost of refinery project with Aramco to $60 bn: Reports,"India has reportedly increased the cost estimate of the refinery and petrochemical project to be jointly built with Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company from $44 billion to $60 billion, a 36% increase. This comes after farmer protests forced the relocation of the plant. The refinery is now expected to be built at Roha in Maharashtra's Raigad district.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has increased the cost estimate of a giant refinery and petrochemical project to be jointly built with Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co by more than 36%, after protests by farmers forced the relocation of the plant, four sources said. The 1.2 million barrels-per-day (bpd) coastal refinery in the western state of Maharashtra is now expected to be built at Roha in the Raigad district, about 100 km (62 miles) south of Mumbai.  The new cost estimate of $60 billion for the refinery was given to Saudi Arabia�s energy minister Khalid al-Falih at a meeting with Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last month in New Delhi, said the four sources familiar with the talks between the two ministers.  �The $60 billion is a preliminary estimate that was told to Saudi Arabia. The final number will be decided on the basis of a detailed feasibility study,� said a source present at the meeting. The project cost at the signing of a deal with Saudi Aramco in 2018 was pegged at $44 billion. The four sources requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.  Despite the cost expansion, the project is still expected to be commissioned in 2025, the sources said. Global oil producers are vying to gain entry into India to establish a stable outlet for their output and to earn profit from the South Asian nation�s strong gasoline and petrochemical demand prospects due to the rising disposable income of its 1.3 billion population.  The world�s third-largest crude oil importer aims to raise its refining capacity by 77% to 8.8 million bpd by 2030.  The state government suspended land acquisition at the previous site in Ratnagiri - about 400 km south of Mumbai - after thousands of farmers refused to surrender their land, fearing the project could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches.  �It is a huge escalation in cost. But since the project is of a mega scale, we expect the investment to be staggered,� said Sri Paravaikkarasu, director at Singapore-based consultancy FGE, adding that her firm was doubtful the 2025 timeline of the project would be met.  The sources said the cost escalation is mainly due to the delay in land acquisition for the project and that all calculations need to be reworked.  State run companies - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum - own 50% of the Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), the company building the project.  Saudi Aramco and ADNOC hold the remaining half. B. Ashok, chief executive of RRPCL, declined comment on the increased cost estimate, and there was no immediate response from India�s national oil ministry.  Saudi Arabia�s Energy Ministry and Saudi Aramco also did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  The Maharashtra state government has promised that land at the new site would be acquired by end-December.  A consortium led by Russia�s Rosneft acquired a controlling stake in Nayara Energy in 2017, illustrating the interest in India refining sector.  Saudi Aramco is also in talks to buy a minority stake in Reliance Industries� refining, marketing and petrochemical business, and analysts say any further delay in land acquisition may force it to take a harder look at the private Indian refiner�s assets.  Investment in a new west coast refinery is a better option as this would give Aramco more say in the operation and configuration of the project, said Paravaikkarasu.  �But if land acquisition is not completed within this year, then Reliance appears to be a better option as this is a running project and they can monetise the investment from day one.�  Reporting by Nidhi Verma in NEW DELHI, with additional reporting by Rania El Gamal in DUBAI; Editing by Tom Hogue",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-saudi-refinery/exclusive-india-raises-cost-of-refinery-project-with-aramco-by-36-sources-idINKCN1UW0RP?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The group said it found more than 55,000 new posts across nine Facebook groups trading fake reviews in July. ""In total, 10 [Facebook] groups had 1,05,669 members on 1 August,"" the group added.",TechCrunch,"Facebook  has failed to clean up the brisk trade in fake product reviews taking place on its platform, an investigation by the consumer association Which?  has found.In June both Facebook and eBay were warned by the UK�s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) they needed to do more to tackle the sale of fake product reviews. On eBay  sellers were offering batches of five-star product reviews in exchange for cash, while Facebook�s platform was found hosting multiple groups were members solicited writers of fake reviews in exchange for free products or cash (or both).A follow-up look at the two platforms by Which? has found a �significant improvement� in the number of eBay listings selling five-star reviews � with the group saying it found just one listing selling five-star reviews after the CMA�s intervention.But little appears to have been done to prevent Facebook groups trading in fake reviews � with Which? finding dozens of Facebook groups that it said �continue to encourage incentivised reviews on a huge scale�.Here�s a sample ad we found doing a ten-second search of Facebook groups� (one of a few we saw that specify they�re after US reviewers)Which? says it found more than 55,000 new posts across just nine Facebook groups trading fake reviews in July, which it said were generating hundreds �or even thousands� of posts per day.It points out the true figure is likely to be higher because Facebook caps the number of posts it quantifies at 10,000 (and three of the ten groups had hit that ceiling).Which? also found Facebook groups trading fake reviews that had sharply increased their membership over a 30-day period, adding that it was �disconcertingly easy to find dozens of suspicious-looking groups in minutes�.We also found a quick search of Facebook�s platform instantly serves a selection of groups soliciting product reviews�Which? says looked in detail at ten groups (it doesn�t name the groups), all of which contained the word �Amazon� in their group name, finding that all of them had seen their membership rise over a 30-day period � with some seeing big spikes in members. �One Facebook group tripled its membership over a 30-day period, while another (which was first started in April 2018) saw member numbers double to more than 5,000,� it writes. �One group had more than 10,000 members after 4,300 people joined it in a month � a 75% increase, despite the group existing since April 2017.�Which? speculates that the surge in Facebook group members could be a direct result of eBay cracking down on fake reviews sellers on its own platform.�In total, the 10 [Facebook] groups had a staggering 105,669 members on 1 August, compared with a membership of 85,647 just 30 days prior to that � representing an increase of nearly 19%,� it adds.Across the ten groups it says there were more than 3,500 new posts promoting inventivised reviews in a single day.

Facebook must immediately take steps to not only address the groups that are reported to it, but also proactively identify and shut down other groups, and put measures in place to prevent more from appearing in the future.��The CMA must now consider enforcement action to ensure that more is being done to protect people from being misled online. Which? will be monitoring the situation closely and piling on the pressure to banish these fake review groups,� she added.Responding to Which?�s findings in a statement, CMA senior director George Lusty said: �It is unacceptable that Facebook groups promoting fake reviews seem to be reappearing. Facebook must take effective steps to deal with this problem by quickly removing the material and stop it from resurfacing.��This is just the start � we�ll be doing more to tackle fake and misleading online reviews,� he added. �Lots of us rely on reviews when shopping online to decide what to buy. It is important that people are able to trust they are genuine, rather than something someone has been paid to write.�In a statement Facebook claimed it has removed 9 out of ten of the groups Which? reported to it and claimed to be �investigating the remaining group�.�We don�t allow people to use Facebook to facilitate or encourage false reviews,� it added. �We continue to improve our tools to proactively prevent this kind of abuse, including investing in technology and increasing the size of our safety and security team to 30,000.�",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/facebook-still-full-of-groups-trading-fake-reviews-says-consumer-group/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He then cupped her face with both hands.�The victim testified during the trial that this made her feel ""angry, uncomfortable and very disgusted"", but she could not push him away because he was a passenger.�She leaned back and raised her voice, saying:

""Sir, sir, sir.�"" He replied: ""Do not throw your anger at me"", and ""I'm the boss of this flight.�"" The victim tried to stand up but Vijayan continued grabbing her right arm.�When she tried again, he put his hand on her right thigh with great force.When she finally managed to get to her feet by grabbing the arm rest, she felt Vijayan touching her by placing his palm on her left buttock.The victim reported the incident to the plane captain, who observed that she was shaken.After the plane landed in Singapore at about 8am on Nov 2, 2017, the victim submitted a report to Scoot and also to the airport police.Vijayan in his defence denied committing any of the acts against the victim and alleged that the victim had fabricated the incident to suppress the fact that he had complained against the other stewardess for her ""poor service"".District Judge Salina Ishak found him guilty of all three charges of using criminal force on the air stewardess to outrage her modesty.The charges were read with a section under the Tokyo Convention Act, which states that any crime occurring on a Singapore-controlled aircraft would constitute an offence under Singapore's law.Vijayan will return to court for mitigation and sentencing on Aug 28.He faces a maximum of two years' jail, fine, caning, or any combination of these punishments for each charge.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2019/aug/05/indian-convicted-for-molesting-air-stewardess-on-chennai-singapore-flight-2014472.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6657,N Korea took $2bn in cyberattacks to fund weapons program: UN,"North Korea has generated an estimated $2 billion for its weapons of mass destruction program using ""widespread and increasingly sophisticated"" cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, a UN report said. North Korea also ""continued to enhance its nuclear and missile programs although it did not conduct a nuclear test or Intercontinental Ballistic Missile launch,"" it added.",Reuters,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea has generated an estimated $2 billion for its weapons of mass destruction programs using �widespread and increasingly sophisticated� cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters on Monday.  Pyongyang also �continued to enhance its nuclear and missile programmes although it did not conduct a nuclear test or ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) launch,� said the report to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee by independent experts monitoring compliance over the past six months. The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment on the report, which was submitted to the Security Council committee last week.  The experts said North Korea �used cyberspace to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks to steal funds from financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to generate income.� They also used cyberspace to launder the stolen money, the report said.  �Democratic People�s Republic of Korea cyber actors, many operating under the direction of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, raise money for its WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programmes, with total proceeds to date estimated at up to two billion US dollars,� the report said.  North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People�s Republic of Korea (DPRK). The Reconnaissance General Bureau is a top North Korean military intelligence agency. The experts said they are investigating �at least 35 reported instances of DPRK actors attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and mining activity designed to earn foreign currency� in some 17 countries.  The U.N. experts said North Korea�s attacks against cryptocurrency exchanges allowed it �to generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector.�  The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang�s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The Council has banned exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capped imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. U.S. President Donald Trump has met with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un three times, most recently in June when he became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.  They agreed to resume stalled talks aimed at getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons program. The talks have yet to resume and in July and early August, North Korea carried out three short-range missiles tests in eight days. When asked about the U.N. report a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said: �We call upon all responsible states to take action to counter North Korea�s ability to conduct malicious cyber activity, which generates revenue that supports its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs.�  The U.N. report was completed before last week�s missile launches by North Korea, but noted that �missile launches in May and July enhanced its overall ballistic missile capabilities.� The U.N. experts said that despite the diplomatic efforts, they found �continued violations� of U.N. sanctions. �For example, the DPRK continued to violate sanctions through ongoing illicit ship-to-ship transfers and procurement of WMD-related items and luxury goods,� the U.N. report said.

6658,We'll develop new nuclear missiles if you do: Putin to US,"Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Monday that the country would start developing short and intermediate-range land-based nuclear missiles if the US started doing the same. This comes after the US announced its formal withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Following US withdrawal, Russia had said that the pact was ""formally dead"".",Reuters,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Monday that Moscow would start developing short and intermediate-range land-based nuclear missiles if the United States started doing the same after the demise of a landmark arms control treaty.  The U.S. formally left the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia on Friday after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty and had already deployed one banned type of missile, an accusation the Kremlin denies. The pact banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500-5,500 km), reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike at short notice. Putin on Monday ordered the defense and foreign ministries and Russia�s SVR foreign intelligence service to closely monitor any steps the U.S. takes to develop, produce or deploy missiles banned under the defunct treaty.  �If Russia obtains reliable information that the United States has finished developing these systems and started to produce them, Russia will have no option other than to engage in a full-scale effort to develop similar missiles,� Putin said in a statement. U.S. officials have said the United States is months away from the first flight tests of an American intermediate-range missile that would serve as a counter to the Russians. Any deployment would be years away, they have said. Putin issued his warning after holding a meeting with Russia�s Security Council to discuss the U.S. move, which Moscow had argued against for months, warning it would undermine a key pillar of international arms control.  Putin said Russia�s arsenal of air and sea-launched missiles combined with its work on developing hypersonic missiles meant it was well placed to offset any threat emanating from the United States for now. But he said it was essential for Moscow and Washington, the world�s largest nuclear powers, to resume arms control talks to prevent what he described as an �unfettered� arms race breaking out. �In order to avoid chaos with no rules, restrictions or laws, we need to once more weigh up all the dangerous consequences and launch a serious and meaningful dialogue free from any ambiguity,� Putin said. Officials from President Donald Trump�s administration, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said Russia has deployed �multiple battalions� of a cruise missile throughout Russia in violation of the defunct pact, including in western Russia, �with the ability to strike critical European targets�. Russia denies the allegation, saying the missile�s range put it outside the treaty and rejected a U.S. demand to destroy the new missile, the Novator 9M729, known as the SSC-8 by the NATO Western military alliance.

6671,US labels China a currency manipulator for 1st time in 25 years,The US has labelled China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the country will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate unfair competition from China. The US action follows China allowing its currency yuan to weaken past the 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government has determined that China is manipulating its currency and will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate unfair competition from Beijing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement on Monday. The move brings already tense U.S.-Chinese relations to a boil and fulfills U.S. President Donald Trump�s promise to label China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994. The U.S. action follows China allowing its yuan to weaken past the key 7-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time in more than a decade. Beijing later said it would stop buying U.S. agricultural products, inflaming a yearlong trade war with the United States. The sharp 1.4% drop in the yuan comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump stunned financial markets by vowing to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, abruptly breaking a brief ceasefire in a bruising trade war that has disrupted global supply chains and slowed growth. The news knocked the dollar  sharply lower and bolstered the price of gold . The Treasury Department said a statement from the People�s Bank of China (PBOC) on Monday made clear that Chinese authorities had ample control over the yuan exchange rate. The PBOC said Monday it would �continue to ... take necessary and targeted measures against the positive feedback behavior that may occur in the foreign exchange market.� �This is an open acknowledgement by the PBOC that it has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis,� the Treasury statement said.  It said China�s actions violate its commitment to refrain from competitive devaluation as part of the Group of 20 industrialized countries. Treasury said it expected China to adhere to those commitments and not target China�s exchange rate for competitive purposes. U.S. law sets out three criteria for identifying manipulation among major trading partners: a material global current account surplus, a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, and persistent one-way intervention in foreign exchange markets. After determining a country is a manipulator, the Treasury is required to demand special talks aimed at correcting an undervalued currency, with penalties such as exclusion from U.S. government procurement contracts. The U.S. Treasury had designated Taiwan and South Korea as currency manipulators in 1988, the year that Congress enacted the currency review law. China was the last country to get the designation, in 1994. In May, the Treasury had refrained from declaring China a currency manipulator based on new tougher criteria measuring a country�s global current account surplus, along with persistent one-way intervention and a large bilateral trade surplus with the United States. In the report, however, Treasury kept China on an enhanced monitoring list due to a �misalignment and undervaluation of the RMB relative to the dollar.� Reporting by Andrea Shalal, David Lawder, Lesley Wroughton and Makini Brice; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Shumaker",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-currency/u-s-designates-china-as-currency-manipulator-idUSKCN1UV2BK?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Cesar Sayoc, 57, who pleaded guilty in March to using weapons of mass destruction and other crimes, began crying when U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan read the sentence. Prosecutors had asked Rakoff to sentence Sayoc to life in prison, while Sayoc�s lawyers had sought a sentence of 10 years plus one month. Ian Marcus Amelkin, one of Sayoc�s lawyers, argued that Sayoc�s crimes were caused by paranoid, delusional thinking brought on by heavy use of steroids. He said Sayoc, who was living in a van at the time of his arrest last year, had struggled all his life with severe learning disabilities, the effects of childhood abuse and social isolation. Sayoc, Amelkin said, saw Trump as a �father figure� and became obsessed with conspiracy theories about people he perceived as being enemies of the president. �We believe that the president�s rhetoric contributed to Mr. Sayoc�s behavior,� he said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jane Kim, one of the prosecutors, argued that Sayoc was a danger to the public and that his crimes warranted severe punishment. �The defendant here set out to terrorize people,� she said. Sayoc expressed remorse shortly before the sentencing. �I am so very sorry for what I did,� he said. Sayoc sent packages containing pipes stuffed with explosives, wires and alarm clocks to 16 intended targets, including former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, billionaire investor and Democratic donor George Soros, former Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan, actor Robert De Niro and CNN. All of the devices were intercepted and none exploded. A report by federal investigators concluded they had no mechanism to trigger an explosion and �would not have functioned as designed.� Prosecutors argued that Sayoc nonetheless meant to injure his targets, while his lawyers said he meant only to inspire fear. Sayoc himself said in a handwritten letter to Rakoff after his guilty plea that the bombs were a �hoax.� Rakoff said he believed Sayoc. �He hated his victims. He wished them no good, but he was not so lost as to wish them dead, at least not by his own hand,� the judge said. Still, the judge said, Sayoc�s crimes were �far too horrible� for a �relatively lenient� 10-year sentence.

He brought Article 370. At that time, it was discussed that Sardar Patel was ready to give Kashmir to Pakistan.�After his statement invited objections from members from the treasury benches, the Chair advised Sibal to steer clear of references that could set off a controversy.Expressing reservation, BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav said that Sibal�s statement cannot be the view of the House.Sibal further asked the government why it did not consult stakeholders before bringing the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.�Today, we should think about why we are here and what should democracy involve.

6708,Open to resuming merger talks with Renault: Fiat Chrysler,"Fiat Chrysler CEO Michael Manley has said that the carmaker is open to resuming merger talks with French automaker Renault, ""if the circumstances change"". In June, Fiat had withdrawn its $35-billion merger proposal with Renault after it was unable to reach an agreement with the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder. The tie-up would have created the world's third-largest automaker.",Times Now,"Paris:�The chief of Fiat Chrysler remains open to the possibility of resuming merger talks with France's Renault, months after talks between the two automakers aimed at forging an industry powerhouse broke down, according to an interview published Monday. Mike Manley told The Financial Times the underlying logic supporting a tie-up remained, despite Fiat's decision to withdraw its proposal for a merger of equals with its French rival in June. ""Should the circumstances change, then maybe dreams come together and things can happen,"" Manley said.Fiat walked away after growing frustrated with tensions between Renault's executives and the French state, which holds a 15 percent stake and double the voting rights. Renault's chairman Jean-Dominique Senard publicly blamed the French state for scuppering the deal, a charge rejected by Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. Mounting friction between Renault and its alliance partner Nissan also cast a pall over the Fiat negotiations, with Japanese executives furious at having been kept in the dark about the plan. But Renault and Nissan are now weighing an overhaul of their partnership that would better align their reciprocal stakes in each automaker, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, which in turn has just a 15 percent stake in Renault, and which carries no voting rights. The French government, for its part, indicated in June that it would be willing to reduce its holding in Renault if it would smooth relations with Nissan. ""As they work through those things, those circumstances that are necessary to move or change potentially could happen,"" Manley told The FT. ""If that were the case, we would be interested in hearing from them,"" he said. Contacted by AFP, Renault did not immediately comment on Manley's statements.Fiat's proposal would have created the world's third-largest automaker, with annual sales of 8.7 million vehicles. Including Nissan and Renault's other alliance partner Mitsubishi, the group would have been a globe-spanning heavyweight selling nearly 16 million cars a year -- or one out of six delivered worldwide.
Mergers are a tempting route for automakers worldwide as they face massive investments for electrifying their fleets amid growing pressure to cut carbon emissions, even as sales growth in many markets slows.",https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/article/fiat-chrysler-open-to-fresh-merger-talks-with-renault-report/464067?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6721,Juul launches smart e-cigarette that monitors users' vaping,US-based e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs has launched a new e-cigarette 'Juul C1' that pairs with an Android-only app via Bluetooth and monitors users' vaping. It has reportedly been launched in the UK after a trial in Canada. The app records data on when and where the e-cigarette is used and keeps track of how many puffs a user takes.,Engadget,"E-cigarette manufacturer Juul has come under fire for contributing to teen smoking rates. Recently, the company has been scrambling to demonstrate its products are aimed at adults, not teens. Its latest defense is an app-connected e-cigarette which requires users to be over 18.The product, called the Juul C1, pairs with an Android-only app via Bluetooth and has been launched in the UK after a trial in Canada, as reported by The Financial Times. It records data on when and where it is used and keeps track of how many puffs a users takes, tracking their average smoking habits. It also has connectivity features like a locator to find your vape if you lose it and a device lock to prevent anyone other than you from using your device.A big part of the push toward tracking is to keep the product out of the hands of teenagers. E-cigarettes carry heath risks like cancer and heart disease, and the FDA is concerned that teens who vape are more likely to start smoking cigarettes. San Francisco has even banned e-cigarettes all together.The C1 app uses facial recognition and a two-step background check to verify a user's age, preventing teenagers from using the device. Recent reports suggest Juul is considering introducing geofencing which would prevent its product from being used in certain areas such as in and around schools. While the C1 doesn't currently do these things, moving vapes towards app connectivity will allow Juul to implement these sort of features down the line.Of course, there's nothing to stop teens from avoiding the C1 or other smart vapes and picking up a traditional dumb e-cigarette instead. And that's not to mention the privacy issues around a product which collects so much data from its users.According to a Bloomberg report, Juul is planning to release Bluetooth-controlled vapes internationally, so the product could come to the US soon.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/05/juul-connected-e-cigarette/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Notably, Australia and the US held talks in Sydney over the weekend that ended with a joint statement in which the two allies pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in Asia-Pacific.",Reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. intermediate-range missiles will not be deployed in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday, after the United States revealed ambitions to site missiles in the Asia-Pacific region. Officials from both governments held talks in Sydney over the weekend that ended with a joint statement in which the two allies pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in Asia-Pacific, as both sides have become increasingly concerned about China�s spreading influence.  During the talks, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper spoke of hopes to deploy missiles in the Asia-Pacific region in coming months following Washington�s withdrawal from a landmark arms control treaty last week. Esper�s comments prompted speculation that Australia had been asked to host the missiles, but Morrison denied that any request had been made and said Australia would decline if it was asked in the future. �It�s not been asked to us, not being considered, not been put to us. I think I the rule a line under that,� Morrison told reporters in Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland. A recent increase in tensions between Washington and Beijing, both over trade and rights of navigation in both the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, has put Australia in an awkward spot, as the United States is its biggest ally, while China is its biggest export market. Beijing last week described Australian efforts to improve the bilateral relationship as �unsatisfactory�. Australia worries China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries which control vast swathes of resource-rich ocean. Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion  ($2.03 billion) in grants and cheap loans to counter what Washington describes as China�s �payday loan diplomacy�.

Researchers at MIT's Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a computer-aided knitting system which can automate the design and manufacture of knitted garments.Even non expert knitters can use the system to create individual designs from customizable templates on a computer. The designs are then sent to a knitting machine, which fabricates the designs out of real wool.The advantage of templates is that common shapes such as hats or gloves are easy to recreate, and users can apply texture and patterns to the objects as well. More ambitious users can create their own patterns from scratch, and there's a neural network system which will generate more panels from an existing pattern.In a test, even users who had never knitted before were able to use the system to create knitted hats and gloves, some with intricate patterns.While it's certainly an impressive system, it does seem to miss out on some of the tactile creativity of knitting by hand. The researchers say they want to make it easy for new knitters to begin creating items, and that the system can also make manufacturing more efficient by eliminating waste.""Whether it's for the everyday user who wants to mimic a friend's beanie hat, or a subset of the public who might benefit from using this tool in a manufacturing setting, we're aiming to make the process more accessible for personal customization,"" says Alexandre Kaspar, lead author of the paper about the new system.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/05/ai-automated-knitting-system/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6761,HSBC CEO John Flint quits 18 months after taking up the role,"British banking firm HSBC on Monday announced the departure of John Flint as the Chief Executive Officer ""by mutual agreement with the board"", just 18 months after he took up the role. Flint's exit was a result of differences of opinion with Chairman Mark Tucker, Reuters reported. Flint will immediately cease his day-to-day responsibilities at HSBC.",Reuters,"HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (HSBA.L) ousted John Flint as chief executive after just 18 months in a shock move the chairman of Europe�s biggest bank said was needed to speed up progress on priority areas such as the turnaround of its U.S. business. The CEO�s exit was a result of differences of opinion with chairman Mark Tucker over Flint�s more tentative approach to cutting expenses and setting revenue targets for senior managers to boost profit growth, a person familiar with the matter said. HSBC disclosed the departure of Flint, 51, alongside its half-year results on Monday as it forecast a gloomier outlook for its business, with an escalation of a trade war between China and the United States, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in its key Hong Kong market and Brexit. HSBC, which makes more than 80% of its profit in Asia, said that its global commercial banking unit head Noel Quinn will be interim chief executive. Shares in HSBC, which fell nearly 14% during Flint�s tenure, were down 1.7% in London at 1111 GMT, even though it reported a 16% rise in profit and a revealed a share buyback of up to $1 billion. Flint, who previously ran London-headquartered HSBC�s retail and wealth management business, was chosen as CEO in February 2018 in the first major decision by Tucker, who told Reuters: �It�s the right time for change, and doing it clearly and decisively from a position of strength is very important.� A key difference with Tucker was over Flint�s efforts to turn around HSBC�s under-performing U.S. business, the person familiar with the matter said. HSBC declined to comment.  Tucker, who became HSBC�s first externally appointed chairman when he joined HSBC�s board in late 2017, said that the search for a new CEO, which will include both internal and external candidates, could take up to a year. HSBC will also cut around 2% of its workforce or around 4,000 jobs this year as it seeks to reduce costs, Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said, adding it will pay out a total of around $650-700 million in severance costs and the reductions will be biased towards senior managers. Flint�s exit also followed weeks of adverse Chinese media coverage over HSBC�s role in the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. China�s Global Times ran an editorial on Friday saying it �feels heat on Huawei CFO case�, suggesting HSBC had erred in cooperating with U.S. authorities and it could face penalties. �Our business operations in China continue as normal,� Tucker told analysts on a conference call when asked whether the bank faced blacklisting in China over the Huawei situation. HSBC executives at the time of his appointment saw Flint as a safe pair of hands and a natural successor to mentor and previous CEO Stuart Gulliver. Outlining his strategy in June last year, Flint set out plans to invest $15-$17 billion in the next three years in areas including technology and China. �We have been uninspired by the �business as usual� strategy,� analyst Ed Firth at broker KBW said. �We suspect that any new CEO is still more likely to be internal, but will need a more dynamic approach to improving underperforming areas of the business,� he said.   HSBC said it no longer expects to achieve the targeted 6% return on tangible equity (ROE) by 2020 in the U.S., where it has struggled for years to build scale and compete. That missed U.S. goal is still below the overall group aim of getting to more than 11% ROE by 2020.  HSBC hired Citigroup veteran Michael Roberts in July to head its U.S. business, in a renewed effort to turn it around. The U.S business is not �getting the proper returns�, HSBC�s CFO Stevenson told Reuters, adding the unit has also been hit by the change in the monetary policy cycle. HSBC�s investment banking business has also struggled in recent years as it lost a string of senior executives and saw U.S. rivals cash in on booming domestic stock markets. Revenues in HSBC�s global banking and markets division fell by 3% in the first half compared with the same period last year. HSBC�s pretax profit for the first six months of 2019 rose to $12.41 billion from $10.71 billion in the same period a year earlier, helped by a surge in retail banking and Asia revenues. �Interest rates in the US dollar bloc are now expected to fall rather than rise, and geopolitical issues could impact a significant number of our major markets,� HSBC said. The U.S.-China trade war has taken its toll on trade-focused banks like HSBC and rival Standard Chartered (STAN.L), which last week warned of an impact on its business customers from the escalating tensions. Tucker played down the impact of protests in Hong Kong against an extradition bill which have evolved into a broader anti-government backlash and said HSBC remained confident about the future of the Asian financial center. Analysts had been watching closely to see whether the bank would announce a fresh buyback, as a failure to do so would have been read as a sign of mounting caution by HSBC�s management. Prior to the latest buyback announcement, HSBC had purchased more than $6 billion of its own shares since 2016.

A car driving against traffic collided with three other cars, causing the explosion, Egypt's interior ministry said in a statement. Health authorities evacuated patients from the institute to other hospitals in the city.",Reuters,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Twenty people were killed and 47 injured when a car packed with explosives intended for a militant attack blew up outside Cairo�s main cancer hospital on Monday, the interior ministry said. Officials initially said the explosion was caused when a car driving against the traffic collided with three other cars. The front of the hospital suffered extensive damaged, with an entrance wrecked and rubble strewn over the pavement. Victims� belongings were scattered among the debris. The interior ministry said the car involved in the incident had been stolen a few months ago. �The initial technical examination also showed that the car contained explosives, and the collision led to their detonation,� a ministry statement said. �It is estimated that the car was being transported to a location for use in the execution of a terrorist operation,� the ministry added. It said the Hasm militant group was responsible for rigging up the car. Egypt accuses Hasm, which emerged in 2016 and has claimed several attacks, of being a wing of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt�s oldest Islamist movement denies this and says it seeks change through peaceful means only. The explosion caused a blaze that forced the partial evacuation of the National Cancer Institute, the health ministry said. One resident, who gave her name as Salwa, said bodies had been fused together by the explosion. �There was a sound of an extremely loud blast. It was no way two cars crashing. The car must have been rigged with explosives,� she told Reuters Television. Another witness, who declined to give his name, said the car�s driver ran away before it exploded. Later in the morning, investigators scoured the scene amid a heavy police presence.  Egypt�s public prosecutor is investigating the incident, sources told Reuters. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi expressed his condolences to the Egyptian people and the families of the victims. He pledged to eradicate �this brutal terrorism�. Egyptian security forces are waging a counterinsurgency campaign against Islamist militants, some with links to Islamic State, that is focused in the north of the Sinai Peninsula. Attacks outside Sinai have become relatively rare, although there have been several security incidents in recent months in Giza, across the Nile from central Cairo. In May, an explosion targeting a tourist bus injured at least 12 people, mostly South African tourists, near the Giza pyramids.  In December, three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed, and at least 10 others injured when a roadside bomb hit their tour bus near the pyramids.

6810,Govt official told me not to discuss I-T harassment: Mazumdar-Shaw,"Biocon's billionaire Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said a government official called her and told her not to speak about issues like Income Tax harassment. ""He said 'please don't make such statements...I'm telling you as a friend',"" Mazumdar-Shaw said. Her claim comes after CCD Founder VG Siddhartha's demise, who alleged harassment by Income Tax officials in a letter purportedly written by him.",The News Minute,"Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, the billionaire businesswoman and head of Biocon, reportedly received a phone call from a �government official� who told her to refrain from discussing issues around income tax harassment, in the wake of the death of Coffee Day founder VG Siddhartha.��He just said that �please don�t make such statements. Even Mohandas Pai should not. I am telling you as a friend,�� Shaw told the Telegraph.Former Infosys Director Pai had told Quint that Shaw had received the phone call. He noted that others, aside from him and Shaw, have also received similar calls.�When Shaw was asked whether the call sounded like a warning or advice, she replied, �you can call it both ways.���Personally, I�ve never had any problems with the tax department,� she told the paper. She also noted that she did not understand why the corporate world was �silent� on the issue. �Only you can decide whether you want to speak out. If you are paying your taxes, why should you worry?���I used to speak out always. It doesn�t matter if UPA is in power or the NDA,� she reportedly said.�Shaw did not respond to request for comment, but on August 3, she tweeted:If Indian inc remains silent it is reflective of a form of crony capitalism! @TVMohandasPaiSiddartha went missing on July 29, which launched a massive manhunt to find him.

6816,Great players like Smith deliver in crisis: James Pattinson,"Australia fast bowler James Pattinson praised his team's ex-captain Steve Smith, saying that ""great players always stand up when you need them"". The 29-year-old called Smith an ""unbelievable"" player, adding, ""Without him, we would be in...trouble."" Smith, who has the second-best batting average in Test history, scored 144 runs in the first innings of the first Test of 2019 Ashes.",Cricket Country,"James Pattinson backed the �fantastic� Steve Smith to rescue Australia once again with the bat in the first Ashes Test against England at Edgbaston.Former captain Smith has already marked his first Test match since completing a 12-month ban imposed by Cricket Australia for his role in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year with a brilliant century.ASHES 2019 FULL SCHEDULE | ASHES 2019 LATEST NEWSHis magnificent 144 helped revive Australia from the depths of 122-8 in their first innings to an eventual total of 284.But Ashes-holders Australia, looking to win their first Test series away to England in 18 years, were again left looking to Smith in their second innings, with the star batsman 46 not out in a total of 124-3 � a lead of 34 runs � at the close of Saturday�s third day.ALSO READ: Ashes 2019 1st Test Day 3: Australia pin hopes on another Steve Smith revival�I was talking to the press before about great players and how they always stand up when you need them,� Australia fast bowler Pattinson told reporters.�And I think he�s done that in this game. Without him, we would be in a bit of trouble.�Smith has found himself repeatedly booed and taunted at Edgbaston, the most raucous of England�s Test grounds.�He�s been copping a bit from the crowd, which has amused a lot of people, but to his credit, he just gets on with it,� Pattinson added. �He�s someone who lifts the group when he�s out there.�Smith was hit on the head on 41 by a bouncer from Ben Stokes after missing an intended pull shot.But he was cleared to bat on after being examined by Australia�s team doctor.�It was quite a good reaction from him (Smith), wasn�t it?,� said Pattinson.�We had a little bit of a chuckle in the dressing-room. He always puts a bit of mayo (exaggerates) on things. He�s a fantastic player and he seems to be fine now.�� �World-class� �
England all-rounder Chris Woakes knows Edgbaston well as it his Warwickshire home ground and he said dismissing Smith on an increasingly slow pitch would be no easy task.�He�s obviously a world-class player and we�ve got to find a way to get him out,� said Woakes, who earlier on Saturday made a valuable 37 not out in an England first-innings total of 374 that featured opener Rory Burns�s maiden Test century.�I think on this surface in particular, it�s hard to force the issue as a bowler.�The pace has gone out of the pitch so you almost have to build pressure to make sure the batsman makes a mistake.�But Steve doesn�t make too many mistakes, so we�ve got to find a way.�England�s task was made harder by James Anderson not bowling on Saturday after he managed just four overs in Australia�s first innings before suffering a calf injury.Anderson, England�s all-time leading Test wicket-taker, now appears unlikely to bowl again in this match and fellow paceman Woakes said: �(His absence) is a bit of a blow but at the same time us as a unit have to go out there and try to do the job.�",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/without-steve-smith-we-would-be-in-a-bit-of-trouble-james-pattinson-875632?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
