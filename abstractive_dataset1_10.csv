This will be the first all-party meet since Rahul Gandhi stepped down as the Congress President. As per media reports, the appointment of the next party president is expected to be the meeting's agenda.",The Quint,"After a long second meeting, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) unanimously elected Sonia Gandhi as the interim president of the Congress, on Saturday, 10 August.The decision was announced after Rahul Gandhi once again refused to take back his resignation from the post of the party head.“The CWC unanimously resolved to request Sonia Gandhi to take over as the interim president, pending the election of a regular president by the AICC,” party leader KC Venugopal said during a press briefing.Earlier during the day, after the first round of consultations held by the CWC to arrive at a consensus party president, Spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had said that Rahul Gandhi refused to withdraw his resignation, even though the committee spoke in one voice and asked him to continue as party president.Surjewala had further added that the CWC, in accordance with the wishes of Rahul Gandhi, has divided itself into five zonal groups, each of which will meet today to discuss the probable names for party president. Their views will then be discussed at the second round of the CWC meeting to be held at 8 pm today.Earlier in the day, after attending the CWC meeting for a brief period, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi told ANI that she and Rahul Gandhi would not be a part of the consultation process. “There is a process of consultation and naturally, Rahul and myself, we cannot be a part of that consultation.”While Sonia Gandhi’s name was in the Eastern Zonal Committee, Rahul Gandhi’s name was present in the Western Zonal Committee. When asked about her and Rahul’s name being present in the list of members holding the consultative process, the UPA Chairperson said “obviously, it’s a mistake.”Those present in the meeting included Randeep Surjewala, KC Venugopal, Harish Rawat, Meira Kumar and Ahmed Patel, among others.Earlier, reports had suggested that Mukul Wasnik, a non-Gandhi, was in contention to become the interim president of the Congress.Also Read : ‘Don’t Consider My Name’: Priyanka Gandhi on Congress’ Top JobPunjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh welcomed Sonia Gandhi’s appointment as interim president of the Congress as the best decision in the current circumstances, and said her experience and understanding will help guide the party.Singh’s tweet reads:“Happy to see Smt. Sonia Gandhiji back in the saddle. It was the best decision in the current circumstances. Her experience and understanding will help guide @INCInida. I wish her and the party all the best.”Other Congress leaders from Punjab and Haryana also hailed her appointment as interim president.  Senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chauhan said dynasty politics was rejected in the last general elections, but the Congress did not learn from it and still wants Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi to lead the party.Chauhan said the BJP has set an example as its leaders grow in the party naturally, while the Congress is unable to move beyond a family.“The Congress is not willing to learn. It is surprising that the CWC still wants Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi to lead the party,” the BJP vice-president said told reporters.(With inputs from PTI)(The Quint is now available on Telegram.

In one or two years, I am sure, there will be a turnaround,” he told PTI in an interview.Jalan also pointed out that the situation today is very different from 1991 when the country faced a severe economic crisis on the external front.“India is in a very strong position today, unlike in 1991.

6831,Google rivals to bid to be default search engine on phones in Europe,"Google will require rivals to bid in order to become listed as alternative search providers on Android smartphones in Europe. Starting next year, Google will ask users to make a choice between Google and three other rival options as their default search provider. A choice screen will be shown during the smartphone set-up or again after any factory reset.",TechCrunch,"Starting early next year Google  will present Android users in Europe with a search engine choice screen when handsets bundle its own search service by default.In a blog post announcing the latest change to flow from the European Union’s record-breaking $5 billion antitrust enforcement against Android last year, when the Commission found Google had imposed illegal restrictions on device makers (OEMs) and carriers using its dominant smartphone platform, it says new Android phones will be shown the choice screen once during set-up (or again after any factory reset).The screen will display a selection of three rival search engines alongside its own.OEMs will still be able to offer Android devices in Europe that bundle a non-Google search engine by default (though per Google’s reworked licensing terms they have to pay it to do so). In those instances Google said the choice screen will not be displayed.Google says rival search engines will be selected for display on the default choice screen, per market, via a fixed-price sealed bid annual auction — with any winners (and/or eligible search providers) being displayed in a random order alongside its own.Search engines that win the auction will secure one of three open slots on the choice screen, with Google’s own search engine always occupying one of the four total slots.“In each country auction, search providers will state the price that they are willing to pay each time a user selects them from the choice screen in the given country,” it writes. “Each country will have a minimum bid threshold. The three highest bidders that meet or exceed the bid threshold for a given country will appear in the choice screen for that country.”If there aren’t enough bids to surface three winners per auction then Google says it will randomly select from a pool of eligible search providers, which it is also inviting to apply to participate in the choice screen. (Eligibility criteria can be found here.)“Next year, we’ll introduce a new way for Android users to select a search provider to power a search box on their home screen and as the default in Chrome (if installed),” it writes. “Search providers can apply to be part of the new choice screen, which will appear when someone is setting up a new Android smartphone or tablet in Europe.”“As always, people can continue to customize and personalize their devices at any time after set up. This includes selecting which apps to download, changing how apps are arranged on the screen, and switching the default search provider in apps like Google Chrome,” it adds.Google’s blog post makes no mention of whether the choice screen will be pushed to the installed base of Android devices. But a spokeswoman told us the implementation requires technical changes that means it can only be supported on new devices.Default selections on a dominant platform are of course hugely important for gaining or sustaining market share. And it’s only since competition authorities dialed up their scrutiny that the company has started to make some shifts in how it bundles its own services in dominant products such as Android and Chrome.Earlier this year Google quietly added rival pro-privacy search engine DuckDuckGo as one of the default choices offered by its Chrome browser, for example.In April it also began rolling out choice screens to both new and existing Android users in Europe — offering a prompt to download additional search apps and browsers.In the latter case, each screen shows five apps in total, including whatever search and browser is already installed. Apps not already installed are included based on their market popularity and shown in a random order.French pro-privacy search engine Qwant told us that since the rollout of the app service choice screen to Android devices the share of Qwant users using its search engine on mobile has leapt up from around 2% to more than a quarter (26%) of its total user base.Qwant co-founder and CEO Eric Léandri said the app choice screen shows that competing against Google on search is possible — but only “thanks to the European Commission” stepping in and forcing the unbundling.However, he raised serious concerns about the sealed bid auction structure that Google has announced for the default search choice — pointing out that many of the bidders for the slots will also be using Google advertising and technology; while the sealed structure of the auction means no-one outside Google will know what prices are being submitted as bids, making it impossible for rivals to know whether the selections Google makes are fair.Even Google’s own FAQ swings abruptly from claims of the auction it has devised being “a fair and objective method” for determining which search providers get slots, to a flat “no” and “no” on any transparency on bid amounts or the number of providers it deems eligible per market…“Even if Google is Google some people can choose something else if they have the choice. But now that Google knows it, it wants to stop the process,” Léandri told TechCrunch.“It is not up to Google to now charge its competitors for its faulty behavior and the amount of the fine, through an auction system that will benefit neither European consumers nor free competition, which should not be distorted by such process,” Qwant added in an emailed press statement. “The proposed bidding process would be open to so-called search engines that derive their results and revenues from Google, thereby creating an unacceptable distortion and a high risk of manipulation, inequity or disloyalty of the auction.”“The decision of the European Commission must benefit European consumers by ensuring the conditions of a freedom of choice based on the intrinsic merits of each engine and the expectations of citizens, especially regarding the protection of their personal data, and not on their ability to fund Google or to be financed by it,” it also said.In a further complaint, Léandri said Google is requiring bidders in the choice screen auction to sign an NDA in order to participate — which Qwant argues would throw a legal obstacle in the way of it being able to participate, considering it is a complainant in the EU’s antitrust case (ongoing because Google is appealing).“Qwant cannot accept that the auction process is subject to a non-disclosure agreement as imposed by Google while its complaint is still pending,” it writes. “Such a confidentiality agreement has no other possible justification than the desire to silence its competitors on the anomalies they would see. This, again, is an unacceptable abuse of its dominant position.”We’ve reached out to the Commission with questions about Google’s choice screen auction. Update: A Commission spokesperson told us:The decision provides rival search providers the possibility to strike exclusive pre-installation deals with smartphone and tablet manufacturers. This was not possible before.In order to ensure the effective implementation of the decision, Google also agreed to implement a choice screen. We have seen in the past that a choice screen can be an effective way to promote user choice.We will be closely monitoring the implementation of the choice screen mechanism, including listening to relevant feedback from the market, in particular in relation to the presentation and mechanics of the choice screen and to the selection mechanism of rival search providers. The Commission is committed to a full and effective implementation of the decision.DuckDuckGo  founder Gabriel Weinberg has also been quick to point to flaws in the auction structure — writing on Twitter: “A ‘ballot box’ screen could be an excellent way to increase meaningful consumer choice if designed properly. Unfortunately, Google’s announcement today will not meaningfully deliver consumer choice.“A pay-to-play auction with only 4 slots means consumers won’t get all the choices they deserve, and Google will profit at the expense of the competition. We encourage regulators to work with directly with Google, us, and others to ensure the best system for consumers.”",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
6834,Tamil Nadu students to clear test for free coaching for NEET,"Tamil Nadu government has said only students who clear a screening test will be eligible for free coaching for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). The Director of School Education said it was done to increase the efficiency of training as many students who were not ""competent enough join the course only to discontinue it within a few weeks"".",The New Indian Express,"CHENNAI: Not all medical aspirants from government schools will be able to access the free coaching offered by the State for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) any longer. Only students who clear a screening test that will be conducted on August 7 will be eligible, a circular from the School Education Department, issued on July 31, said. Experts have sharply criticised the government for conducting the test with such short notice. The Director of School Education S Kannappan told Express that the screening test was being introduced to increase the efficiency of training as many students who were not “competent enough will join the course only to discontinue it within a few weeks”. He said more students who were interested in pursuing medicine would be able to get effective training if the total number of students in every centre was reduced.“Every centre can take in up to 50 students. Many students who score really poor marks sign up for coaching. A lot of manpower and time is spent on them. However, if we only have interested students, teachers will also be motivated to teach them,” he said. Students who clear the screening test will receive free coaching during the weekends in addition to short tests, said Kannappan.Students from this lot, who perform well, will be selected to undergo an intensive two-month training programme at the end, he said. While introduction of NEET created furore in the State, this decision too has been met with criticism. “A free coaching offered by the government should benefit as many children as possible as it is aspirational and gives them hope,” said D Anandakrishnan, educationalist and former Vice-Chancellor of Anna University. ‘It puts onus of clearing test on student alone’  
“The government is not going to see a significant improvement by restricting access to it. Further, students need preparation time for any test. Having one at such short notice will leave them confused,” Anandakrishnan said. PK Ilamaran,  president of Tamil Nadu Government School Teachers Association, said students were not prepared for a screening test at this point. “Most students who come to government schools have a difficult background. Many of them are still enrolling into schools. Getting eliminated at such an early point in the year will leave even late-bloomers demotivated,” he said. Further, the move puts the onus of clearing NEET on the student alone.Weekly prep

The MLAs were subsequently expelled from their respective parties.During the trust vote too, Kumaraswamy had said his entry into politics and becoming the CM was accidental, as he was offered the chief ministership by the Congress at a time when he was mulling staying away from politics after the May 2018 Assembly polls in which his party ended up a distant third.The Congress and JD(S), which had contested against each other in the Assembly polls, joined hands to form the government as the election threw up a hung verdict. By joining hands, they kept the BJP, the single-largest party, out of power.Following the collapse of the Kumaraswamy government on 23 July, BJP’s BS Yediyurappa was sworn-in as chief minister on 26 July and he subsequently proved the majority in the Assembly on 29 July.(This story has been edited for clarity.)Also Read : Yediyurappa Wins Karnataka Trust Vote: A Brief Timeline of Events(This story was auto-published from a syndicated feed.

According to them, if not amended, the bill will lead to deterioration of medical education and degradation of healthcare services.The fraternity is opposing section 32(1), (2) and (3) of the bill, saying it will encourage quackery by providing licence to practice modern medicine as community health providers for persons other than those possessing MBBS degrees.Doctors say there was no clarity over the introduction of National Exit Test and scrapping the NEET-PG. They are also opposing decreasing the percentage of seats under controlled fees structure in private medical colleges and deemed universities from 85 to 50 per cent, reducing representation of elected members from 75 per cent in MCI to 20 per cent in National Medical Commission and autonomous boards constituted there-under.They are objecting to section 45 of the bill, which, they claim, empowers the Union government to override any suggestion of the National Medical Commission.The bill proposes a common final-year MBBS examination, to be known as the National Exit Test (NEXT), for admission to post-graduate medical courses and for obtaining a licence to practise medicine.It would also act as a screening test for foreign medical graduates.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

He is currently plying his trade in the ongoing edition of the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL). His team, Ruby Trichy Warriors, is currently languishing at the bottom of the points table with five defeats from as many matches. But Vijay’s confidence is on a high since he has been scoring good runs in the tournament.The poise has also rubbed off positively in him as an individual. Vijay has been innovative as well in his approach. In the Warriors’ last encounter against table-toppers Dindigul Dragons, he batted left-handed while facing off-spinner Ravi Ashwin, the Dragons’ skipper and India’s Test specialist.AdvertisementBut he couldn’t quite time the ball properly in both the instances. In the 16th over of the Warriors’ innings when Ashwin was set to bowl his third over, Vijay spread his hands and started showing his dance moves. At that point in time, he was batting on 73 off 46 and was seeing the ball like a football.Luck didn’t favour Vijay in that game by any means as he got out on 99 in the second ball of the final over. His thunderous knock was laced with seven boundaries and as many sixes and he played at a strike-rate of 159.68. He was dismissed by fast bowler Jagannathan Kaushik when he was trying to up the ante. But his masterclass took the Warriors to a formidable score of 178 in their 20 overs.Vijay’s knock went in vain though as the Dragons won by five wickets in the last over of the close contest. Narayan Jagadeesan, the Dragons’ opening batsman came to the party and notched 105 off 60 balls with 12 fours and four over-boundaries. Vijay didn’t have a great day with the ball.

            Speaking at the 10th edition of the Indian Management Conclave here on Saturday, the former President laid emphasis on the need to promote basic research in the country.He cited the example of the first year of his Presidency when at the convocation of one IIT he asked the Director whether he knew of any student who had dedicated his life for basic research or education. “The Director fumbled and replied he is not sure.”India has led the excellence in education for more than 1,800 years from 6th century BC to 12th century AD with universities such as Takshshila, Nalanda and Vikramshila, Mukherjee said.“We don’t want that every year thousands of students go abroad for higher studies. Rather I want the traffic should reverse, like it used to happen for over 1,800 years. Till Nalanda and Vikramshila were destroyed, India was leading in the field of higher education.”Mukherjee said he was proud of the country’s IIT graduates.“India has a brand name. Beginning from the first five-year plan to the 12th five-year plan, we built huge infrastructure in higher education. More than 1,000 universities, 36,000 colleges, increase in number of IITs from eight to 16, 30 NITs, scores of IIScs and also the management institutions,” he said.“But unfortunately in over 70 years from 1933, there has been no Nobel laureate who is doing basic research work in any Indian university. It is not the question of lack of talent, but ambience or the environment where students are encouraged for basic research. This is the most pertinent thing in education,” he added.Citing the example of former Chief Justice of India Sudhir Ranjan Das, Mukherjee said that he used to take classes for school students.The former President said the country needed teachers who helped students in fostering research.He cited the example of the legendary Vashishtha Narayan Singh, a mathematician who obtained a PhD from the University of Berkeley despite being poor due to the encouragement from his teachers.“I would urge the teachers and faculty members to build such excellence,” he said.Mukherjee added that in general ratings globally, hardly any Indian university found a place in top 200. “It is not that Indian universities are not competent, but there are certain technicalities that are followed by others which are not followed by us.”Mukherjee said: “The world is going to be a global village, and we all will be the residents of that global village. We need to equip ourselves for the global economy by updating our skills. We have to find out new skills, new technologies and new methods that can help in advancement of society.“India is going to be the largest economy but I don’t want that economy to be stagnant.”",https://www.india.com/news/india/iit-graduates-cannot-be-selling-detergents-pranab-mukherjee-3736054/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It may be important to stop undergraduate programmes that are limited in scope (for example in specialised subjects like Biotechnology or Bioinformatics ), as they provide training only in specialised subjects.“All full-time under-graduate programmes must be broad-based. Professional and vocational courses that facilitate jobs should be run separately as Diploma courses,” the report added.The Four Year Undergraduate Programme (FYUP) introduced by the Delhi University under the regime of previous Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh was scrapped by former Human Resource Development minister Smriti Irani.The NEP panel led by former ISRO chief K Kasturirangan, which submitted its report to the new HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, has recommended re-introduction of the four-year course as part of the undergraduate reforms.“Both three-year and four-year courses will be allowed to co-exist, but with multiple exit and entry options.

6863,China destabilising Indo-Pacific: US Defence Secretary,"US Defence Secretary Mark Esper on Sunday said that China is destabilising the Indo-Pacific, adding that the US stands ""firmly against a disturbing pattern of aggressive behaviour from China"". ""We firmly believe no one nation can or should dominate the Indo-Pacific and we are working alongside our allies and partners to address the region's pressing security needs,"" he further said.",Reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - China is destabilizing the Indo-Pacific, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Sunday, charging Beijing with predatory economics, intellectual property theft and “weaponizing the global commons”. The comments by Esper on his first overseas trip as U.S. defense secretary threaten to inflame already heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing as they wage an escalating trade war. China’s increasing assertiveness, especially in the energy-rich South China Sea, has raised concerns within the region and the United States is challenging Chinese maritime hegemony and seeking stronger ties with nations pushing back against Beijing.  “We firmly believe no one nation can or should dominate the Indo-Pacific and we are working alongside our allies and partners to address the region’s pressing security needs, Esper told reporters in Sydney. “We also stand firmly against a disturbing pattern of aggressive behavior, destabilizing behavior from China. This includes weaponizing the global commons, using predatory economics and debt for sovereignty deals, and promoting state-sponsored theft of other nations’ intellectual property.”China has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea. China claims large parts of the South China Sea through which roughly $3.4 trillion in shipping passes each year. Countries including Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam contest the territorial claims. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday decried “decades of bad behavior” from China that have hampered free trade, laying out a case at a Southeast Asian forum in Bangkok for Washington’s trade war with Beijing. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday slapped 10% tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports, stunning financial markets and ending a month-long trade war truce. China vowed on Friday to fight back. Both Esper and Pompeo met with their Australian counterparts in Sydney on Sunday at an annual security forum where the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific. The United States and its Western allies worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries which control vast swathes of resource-rich ocean. Australia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2.04 billion) in grants and cheap loans to counter what Washington describes as China’s “payday loan diplomacy”. “Cooperation with us and our Australian friends bring mutual benefits, not zeros, deals where one side wins and other risks losing,” said Pompeo in a thinly veiled criticism of China’s aid. Meanwhile, Pompeo said he was “very confident” the United States would be able to build a maritime coalition in the Gulf, despite a lukewarm response from European and Asian allies.

However, in an interview with Good Times, Falguni irked one and all with her comments for plus size women as she said, ""I won't blatantly tell her to lose weight, but you have enough time and you can work on yourself. It is pretty easy to lose a couple of inches if you want to.” Further, when she was asked as to what advice would she give to a bride who is unable to lose weight, she replied, ""Long blouses, more flared lehengas and not fitted- because fitted won't really work when you’re a little big. No deep necks for them maybe more higher.""

This snowballed into a controversy and even the video was pulled down. Amber Qureshi, who's the owner of The Plum Tree fashion, a brand that caters to plus size women also called out to the designer on her Instagram page and garnered support from netizens.

6879,"Iran seizes foreign oil tanker in Gulf, detains 7 sailors","Iran on Sunday seized a foreign oil tanker in the Persian Gulf for smuggling fuel to ""some Arab states"", Iranian state media said. Seven sailors onboard the tanker, who are from different nationalities, have been detained, it added. Earlier, Iran had seized a British-flagged tanker in response to the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker by British Royal Marines.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Revolutionary Guards seized an Iraqi oil tanker in the Gulf which they said was smuggling fuel and detained seven crewmen, Iran’s state media reported on Sunday, in a show of power amid heightened tension with the West. The vessel was intercepted near Iran’s Farsi Island in the Gulf, Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency said. The elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has a navy base on Farsi Island which is located north of the Strait of Hormuz.  “The IRGC’s naval forces have seized a foreign oil tanker in the Persian Gulf that was smuggling fuel for some Arab countries,” the Guards commander Ramezan Zirahi told state TV. The state news agency IRNA, quoting the Guards, said it was an Iraqi ship that was seized on Wednesday night in the Gulf.   Zirahi said it was carrying 700,000 liters of fuel, without elaborating on the nationalities of the detained crewmen.        “The boats of the IRGC navy were patrolling the area to control traffic and detect illicit trade when they seized the tanker,” Fars quoted Zirahi as saying, adding that the seizure was in coordination with Iran’s judicial authorities.  Iran, which has some of the world’s cheapest fuel prices due to heavy state subsidies and the fall of its currency, has been fighting rampant fuel smuggling by land to neighboring countries and by sea to Gulf Arab states. “The tanker was transferred to the Bushehr port, where its fuel was handed over to the authorities,” Zirahi told TV.  A spokesman for the U.S. Navy’s Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet said they had no information to confirm the media reports. Iran’s English-language Press TV aired a video that it said “shows the process through which the IRGC have halted the ship and taken it into custody”. “The ship was seized in Iranian territorial waters and had been transporting diesel fuel,” it added. Another oil tanker, the Panama-flagged MT Riah, was captured by the elite force last month for allegedly smuggling fuel. Tensions have risen between Iran and the West since last year when the United States pulled out of an international agreement which curbed the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program in return for an easing of economic sanctions on Iran. Fuelling fears of a Middle East war with global repercussions, the Guards seized British tanker Stena Impero near the Strait of Hormuz in July for alleged marine violations, two weeks after British forces captured an Iranian oil tanker near Gibraltar accused of violating sanctions on Syria. Angered by intensified U.S. sanctions designed to strangle its vital oil trade and the failure of Britain and European parties to the agreement to salvage the pact, Tehran has decreased its commitments to the nuclear deal.   Iran also has threatened to block all exports through the Strait, if countries heed U.S. calls to stop buying Iranian oil. One-fifth of global oil consumption passes through the Strait from Middle East crude producers to major markets.  “The Persian Gulf is like a tinderbox and explosion of a  firecracker can lead to a huge disaster,” the semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Guards commander Brigadier General Ahmadreza Pourdastan as saying on Sunday. “All countries which have interests in the region  absolutely are not willing to see a new regional crisis.”  After several attacks in May and June on oil tankers - blamed by Washington on Tehran, which denied responsibility - Trump has been trying to forge a military coalition to secure Gulf waters, though European allies have been loath to join for fear of provoking open conflict. European parties to the deal - Britain, France and Germany - have instead appealed for diplomatic moves to defuse the crisis and have been trying to salvage the pact by exploring ways to shield Iran’s economy from U.S. sanctions.  Tehran has called on them to accelerate their efforts or it will further decrease its commitments to the agreement. Britain said on July 25 it had started sending a warship to accompany all British-flagged vessels through the Strait. Iran has repeatedly said it will not allow any disturbance in shipping in the key oil transport waterway, claiming responsibility for the security of the Strait.  In an apparent bid to calm tensions in the Gulf, Shi’ite-dominated Iran has called for improving relations with its regional Sunni rivals Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last month, Iran and the UAE revived maritime security talks in Tehran that had been off since 2013. Iranian media reported on Sunday that Iranian and Qatari coast guards will meet to “improve maritime and border cooperation”.

He said he recently received a license to carry a firearm and had his gun with him. “We’re trained, when you hear gunshots, to pull out your weapon and think fast,” he said. “It’s a feeling that you can’t explain.” Oakley said that as he tried to make it to the parking lot he saw “a whole bunch” of children running around without their parents, some crying. “So I pick up as many as possible and carry them with me and another guy does as well,” he said, before apologizing to the KTSM reporter: “I’m sorry, I’m shaking.” Police said a white male in his 20s was taken into custody without incident after the shooting. When Oakley made it to the mall’s parking lot, there was more drama to come.    “When I got out I guess one of the cops thought I was the shooter or something, so I had to show him my clip to show it was still full,” he said.  As many social media users praised him, Oakley said that in the moment he was more worried for the children than himself. “I was thinking that if my child, if I had one, was in the same predicament, what would I want somebody else to do?” he said.

Subbarao added India should be ""wary"" of the decision ultimately taken on the surplus reserves and transfer.",BloombergQuint,"Raiding the reserves of the central bank only illustrates the ""desperation"" of a government, and we should be very wary and careful while determining the value of the excess reserves, warned former governor D Subbarao on Friday.The career bureaucrat-turned-central banker said he would be ""ok"" if a sovereign bond issue in foreign currency is done once just to test the waters, but cautioned against using the instrument regularly.""A government trying to raid the balance sheet of a central bank anywhere in the world is not a good thing. It shows that the government is desperate, he said, speaking at a CFA Society India event in Mumbai.In defence of his opposition to the desperate attempts to carve out the reserves, the former governor, who was at the helm during the 2008 global meltdown,said the risks undertaken by the RBI are different from other central banks and it will not be entirely beneficial to draw from international practices.The comments from Subbarao come at a time when the Bimal Jalan committee is reported to be in the final stages of finalising its report on identifying the appropriate capital for the RBI and how to transfer the excess to the government.Acknowledging that transfer of the excess reserves was one of the key causes of tension between the RBI and Government in the run up to Governor Urjit Patel’s resignation, Subbarao seemed to suggest that there is little use of the transfers from a fund inflow perspective.He said international investors look at balance sheets of both the government and also its central bank, and that the same applies to distress time lending by the International Monetary Fund as well.""... I do want to say that we should be very careful, very wary of what decision is ultimately taken on the transfer of the surplus reserves, he said.Many analysts have pegged the so called excess reserves at around Rs 9 trillion, or around 27 percent of its core capital, and say the Jalan panel may suggest a staggered payout in the range of Rs 1.5 trillion to Rs 3 trillion over a period of three years.He advocated maintaining the autonomy of the RBI as essential because of its horizons extend far beyond the immediate objective of elections which a government can be guided by.Meanwhile, in a departure from his predecessor YV Reddy and successor Raghuram Rajan, Subbarao said it will be ""ok"" for the government to test the waters with an overseas bond issue.""I would say that as a one-time measure, just to test the waters, its ok, he said.However, the former governor, who now teaches at a Singaporean university, made his apprehensions on the instrument from a long-term perspective clear.But the fear and concern that strike me is that this will become a thin end of the wedge and once we see that it has become very successful, we might keep on doing it and get into pressure situations needlessly, he said.The government can just print its way out of issues on domestic debt, which will not be possible in case of external debt, he warned.There are significant benefits, there are considerable costs of such a move, Subbarao said.The benefits include signalling a confidence to the global investors about opening up the economy which is generally perceived to be cautious on opening up, he said.Concerns on issuing sovereign bonds stem from being made hostage to global rate movements and exposing the systems to volatilities, he said.On the issue of transmission, where banks are being blamed for taking longer to pass on RBIs rate calls to their borrowers, Subbarao said the central banks worries are coming largely from the need to establish its credibility.Subbarao said the move to inflation targeting has so far been proved to be good, but added that the system will only be tested in times or pressure like stagflation which he had to face.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/economy-finance/subbarao-says-raiding-rbi-reserves-shows-govts-desperation?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6903,20 killed in shooting at Walmart store in US; gunman arrested,"A gunman armed with a rifle killed 20 people at a Walmart store in Texas, US, on Saturday before being arrested. Police said the suspect, who has been identified by US media as Patrick Crusius, was a resident of the city of Allen. The shooting comes just six days after a gunman killed three people at a California food festival.",Reuters,"EL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - A man armed with a rifle opened fire at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday, killing 20 people and wounding 26 others as panicked shoppers and employees scurried for cover before the gunman surrendered to police at the scene. Many shoppers in the busy store were buying back-to-school supplies when they found themselves caught up in the latest mass shooting to rock the United States, just six days after a teenage gunman killed three people at a summer food festival in Northern California. Saturday’s suspect was officially identified as a 21-year-old white male from Allen, Texas, a Dallas suburb some 650 miles (1,046 km) east of El Paso, which lies along the Rio Grande, across the U.S.-Mexico border from Ciudad Juarez. Citing law enforcement officials, multiple news media reports named the suspect as Patrick Crusius.  El Paso police chief Greg Allen said authorities were examining a manifesto from the suspect indicating “there is a potential nexus to a hate crime.” Officials declined to elaborate and said the investigation was continuing. But a four-page statement posted on 8chan, an online message board often used by extremists, and believed to have been authored by the suspect, called the Walmart attack “a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.” It also expressed for support for the gunman who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. CNN reported that the FBI has opened a domestic terror investigation into the Texas shooting. El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, together with the neighboring city of Las Cruces, New Mexico, form a metropolitan border area of some 2.5 million residents constituting the largest bilingual, bi-national population in North America. Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said three Mexican nationals were among the dead, and six others were among the wounded. The carnage ranked as the eighth-deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, after a 1984 shooting in San Ysidro, California, that claimed 21 lives. “We are going to aggressively prosecute it both as capital murder but also as a hate crime, which is exactly what it appears to be,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott told reporters, adding, “I don’t want to get ahead of the evidence.”   (Graphic: Mass shootings in the United States - tmsnrt.rs/2KefvTT) Details of how the shooting unfolded were not immediately clear. But video footage from the scene showed victims lying on the ground inside and outside the store. One shopper told Reuters the gunshots sounded like they began outside the building. The suspect surrendered to police as officers closed in on him, and he was taken into custody without incident, authorities said. Video posted on social media appeared to show him being handcuffed by police and placed in a squad car. El Paso Mayor Dee Margo said police responded to the shooting within six minutes. Citing a law enforcement source, El Paso television station KTSM published on its website what it said were two photos of the suspect taken by security cameras as he entered the Walmart. The images showed a young man wearing eyeglasses, khaki trousers and a dark T-shirt, wielding an assault-style rifle. He appeared to be wearing headphones or ear protection. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the images. On Twitter, U.S. President Donald Trump branded the shooting “an act of cowardice,” adding, “I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today’s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people.” About half of the injured, including at least two children, were initially taken to the University Medical Center of El Paso, where a number of the victims remained in surgery hours later, hospital spokesman Ryan Mielke said. Officers from several law enforcement agencies raced to the scene at the Walmart and nearby Cielo Vista Mall, including local police, state troopers, Homeland Security agents and border patrol. Shoppers fled for their lives, including Kianna Long who was at the Walmart with her spouse when they heard gunfire. “People were panicking and running,” Long said. “They were running close to the floor, people were dropping on the floor.” Her husband, Kendall, said the sound of gunfire seemed to move indoors after initial shots that he heard coming from outside.     The couple sprinted through a stock room at the back of the store before huddling with other customers in a steel container in a shipping area. Glendon Oakley, an off-duty soldier who was in the store, told KTSM-TV that he and another man rounded up children they saw running in terror without their parents and hustled them to safety.  In the shooting’s aftermath, Walmart and adjacent businesses, including the mall and a movie theater, were closed as police conducted an initial search for additional possible suspects. Authorities later said the gunman had acted alone. Local media said there was such an overwhelming response to appeals for blood donations that long lines formed at medical centers, where some would-be donors were asked to return on Sunday. The tragedy in El Paso came just six days after a teenage gunman opened fire with an assault-style rifle on a crowd attending the annual Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, killing three people and injuring a dozen others before he was shot by police and ultimately took his own life.  At a Democratic presidential candidate forum in Las Vegas a clearly emotional Beto O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman who is from El Paso, broke the news to the audience about the deadly mass shooting in his home city. Addressing reporters, he teared up and struggled to deliver a short statement.  “I am incredibly saddened and it’s very hard to think about this,” he said. “El Paso is the strongest place in the world. This community is going to come together. I’m going back there right now to be with my family, to be with my home town.” Several other Democratic presidential contenders joined in condemning the rise of mass shootings, with Pete Buttigieg declaring: “America is under attack from homegrown white nationalist terrorism.” Reporting by Julio-Cesar Chavez in El Paso; Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles and Tim Reid in Las Vegas; Writing by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Susan Thomas",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-shooting/gunman-kills-20-in-rampage-at-walmart-store-in-texas-idUSKCN1UT0HQ?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He had tried to enter India illegally through the sea in Tamil Nadu and was sent back to the Maldives. Adeeb is facing investigation for alleged misappropriation of state funds, corruption and money laundering",Reuters,"NEW DELHI/MALE (Reuters) - Maldives police on Saturday said they had arrested former vice-president Ahmed Adeeb and were bringing him to the capital Male after he was refused entry to India.  Adeeb, who was sentenced to 15 years in jail in 2016 for allegedly plotting to assassinate the Maldives’ then-president Abdulla Yameen, was detained early on Thursday in the southern Indian city of Thoothukudi after arriving illegally by tugboat.   “We would like to confirm that Ahmed Adeeb Abdul Ghafoor of H. Saamaraa has been arrested and is being transported to Male under our custody,” Maldives police said in a Twitter post. An Indian port official in Thoothukudi said Adeeb had been sent back to the Maldives late on Friday on a boat escorted by a coast guard vessel. Adeeb is expected to reach Indian Ocean island chain by Sunday or Monday, an official at the Maldives’ foreign ministry said.  London-based legal group Guernica 37, which is representing Adeeb, said in a statement on Sunday that he had been held on a boat at the Indian port and “made a plea for asylum at this time and was being questioned by the Indian authorities”. “As his international counsel I was prevented from speaking to him...the Indian authorities were under an obligation to properly assess his request,” said Toby Cadman of Guernica 37.  “As we now believe he is being detained by the Maldivian authorities, we will be petitioning the United Nations Special Procedures in Geneva, in particular the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention,” Cadman added. Adeeb, 37, was also convicted three years ago of corruption and terrorism and faced a total sentence of 33 years.  A court in the South Asian archipelago ordered a fresh trial on the same charges this year after cancelling his convictions, citing undue political interference. A key witness in a money laundering case against Yameen, Adeeb was once seen as a future leader of the Maldives. Yameen has pleaded not guilty in the case. Adeeb was freed from house arrest earlier this month. “It is notable that the Supreme Court acquitted Mr. Adeeb due to the political interference in his trial,” said Guernica 37’s Cadman. “The fact that a person is accused of a criminal offence does not mean that that person is guilty.”  Indian authorities were tipped off about Adeeb’s arrival in Thoothukudi by the company operating the Singapore-flagged tugboat carrying him.

Her lawyer has been taken off the ventilator, but he is still not out of danger. A CBI team visited the rape survivor’s uncle, lodged in a Rae Bareli prison, on Friday. Later in the night, the Rae Bareli administration, in compliance with a Supreme Court directive, shifted the rape survivor’s uncle to the Tihar jail in Delhi. Another four-member CBI team visited the native village of the rape survivor in Unnao on Saturday.Also read: No reason to panic, only rumor-mongering going on: Governor Satyapal Malik on tensions in J&KAccording to the police station in-charge, Naradmuni, the team was in the village for hours and returned to Lucknow after conducting investigations. No one from the victim’s family was present in the village at the time of the CBI team’s visit, he said.In Rae Bareli, a CBI team was busy probing the accident by recreating the sequence of events of the accident and also questioned the driver and the cleaner of the truck that had rammed into the car in which the victim was travelling with her family members and lawyer. Meanwhile, Sengar’s arms licences for a single barrel gun, a rifle and a revolver were cancelled on Friday, some 15 months after he was arrested by the CBI on April 13, 2018, on charges of raping the woman in 2017 when she was a minor. In more embarrassment for the ruling BJP in the case, party’s Hardoi MLA Ashish Singh Ashu openly expressed sympathises with Sengar in his “difficult times”. A video clip, in which Ashu also wished that Sengar walks out of jail soon, went viral on news channels on Saturday.“Our brother Kuldeep Singh could not be here among us today as he is going through difficult times. Our best wishes are with him. We hope that he will overcome the bad times, fight through it and come out of it and be with all of you to lead you,” Ashu said at a panchayat meeting in Unnao on Friday.“Wherever we are, our best wishes are with him,” he said. Unnao is the hometown of Sengar. The BJP, however, distanced itself from Ashu’s remarks, saying the comments were made by him in his personal capacity. “So far as the BJP is concerned, whatever disciplinary action it had to take, has been taken. Sengar has been expelled. Unless one is proved guilty, one is innocent in the eyes of the law. May be the MLA (Ashu) spoke on these lines,” BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi told PTI.The BJP expelled Sengar earlier this week amid growing public outrage. According to the Supreme Court’s order, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel have take n over the security of the victim and her lawyer. They have been deployed at the entry gate of the Critical Care Unit at the third floor of the Trauma Centre, where the victim is undergoing treatment. Because of pneumonia, the rape survivor has also developed fever and is also being administered medication for controlling blood pressure. She is being given oxygen through a tube inserted in her windpipe, Trauma Centra in-charge Dr Sandeep Tiwari told PTI. Though the lawyer has been taken off the ventilator, but he is not out of danger as he suffered head injuries, the doctor said.CBI officials, including women officials, also visited the Trauma Centre on Friday and Saturday to speak to the victim’s family members. Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to Twitter to thank young girls for supporting her party’s signature campaign to seek justice for the Unnao rape survivor.“Thank you to all the girls from Lucknow for coming out so strongly in support of #UnnaoKiBeti, if all of us stand together, we can force those who empower rapists and criminals into consciousness and change,” she said in a tweet. The Congress leader also posted pictures of girls signing the boards placed outside universities and colleges in Uttar Pradesh.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.
