2872,FB to notify all users if others try to use their pics in own profile,"Facebook has announced that it's removing the 'tag suggestions' feature which uses facial recognition technology to identify users in photos and videos. It added that it's now offering its broader 'face recognition' setting, earlier available to select users since December 2017, to all users. The setting notifies users if others try to use the users' image as own profile picture.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc is opening up its face recognition technology to all users with an option to opt out, the social media company said on Tuesday, as it discontinued a related feature called �Tag Suggestions.� The old feature enabled users to choose whether Facebook could suggest that their friends tag them in photos, without giving them control over other uses of the technology. The face recognition setting, available to some Facebook users since December 2017, has additional functions such as notifying account holders if their profile photo is used by someone else. People who opt in to the new setting will still have tag suggestions automatically generated about them. Facebook�s face recognition technology has been at the center of a privacy related lawsuit since 2015.  The lawsuit by Illinois users accused the company of violating the state�s Biometric Information Privacy Act, claiming it illegally collected and stored biometric data of millions of users without their consent. Last month, a federal appeals court rejected Facebook�s effort to undo the class action status of the lawsuit. �We have always disclosed our use of face recognition technology and that people can turn it on or off at any time,� Facebook said last month. The company said it continues to engage with privacy experts, academics, regulators and its users on face recognition and its control options.

2874,"Tesla driver from 2018 crash was eating, had Autopilot on: US agency","US government investigative agency NTSB's preliminary report on the 2018 crash involving a 2014 Tesla Model S and a fire truck claimed that the car was in Autopilot mode. Autopilot was engaged continuously for the final 13 minutes 48 seconds before the collision, NTSB said. ""I was having a coffee and a bagel,"" the car's driver also told the NTSB.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday that a Tesla Model S was in Autopilot mode and the driver�s hands were off the wheel when it struck a fire truck in Culver City, California, one of a series of crashes the board is investigating involving Tesla�s driver assistance system. The 2014 Model S Autopilot system was engaged continuously for the final 13 minutes 48 seconds of the trip before the vehicle struck a fire truck parked on Interstate-405 in January 2018, the NTSB safety board said in documents posted on Tuesday. The board plans to issue a report detailing the crash�s probable cause on Wednesday. The driver kept his hands off the wheel for all but 51 seconds of the final drive segment and received numerous alerts to place his hands back on the wheel, the documents showed. Tesla Inc did not immediately comment. The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident. �I was having a coffee and a bagel. And all I remember, that truck, and then I just saw the boom in my face and that was it,� the man behind the wheel told the NTSB. The report says the Tesla was following a vehicle for an extended period at a speed of around 21 miles per hour (33.8 kph) when the vehicle ahead changed lanes seconds before the crash After the vehicle in front shifted, the Tesla began accelerating toward the driver-set cruise control speed of 80 mph (129 kph) and hit the parked fire truck while going 30.9 mph. The system did not detect the driver�s hands on the wheel for the final 3 minutes and 41 seconds of the crash. He did not remember precisely what he was doing at the time of the crash but could have been changing the radio or drinking coffee. Records show the driver was not using his cellphone to text or talk at the time of the crash, the NTSB said. Tesla�s Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal U.S. crashes, including fatal March 2018 crashes of a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida and in Mountain View, California of a Model X. Both of those crashes remain under investigation by the NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agencies are also investigating other crashes and battery fires involving Tesla vehicles. The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system�s ability to detect hazards and has sparked concern about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system. In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, while Autopilot was engaged, when he slammed into a tractor trailer. The NTSB said in 2017 that Tesla lacked proper safeguards allowing the Florida driver �to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.� Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Bill Berkrot",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/tesla-autopilot-engaged-in-2018-california-crash-drivers-hands-off-wheel-ntsb-idUSKCN1VO22E?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2904,Apple patents Watch band that could identify users from wrist skin,Apple has patented Watch strap with technology to potentially identify users using the skin on their wrists. The patent revealed that the technology could use infrared to build a thermal image of a user's wrist and its identifying traits like skin texture or arm hair for the identification. The Apple Watch presently lacks any biometric authentication system.,TechCrunch,"It looks like Apple  is playing with the idea of making the Apple Watch�s band a bit smarter.As spotted by PatentlyApple, the company was granted a handful of patents this morning, all focused on bringing new tricks to the Watch by way of the band.The first patent describes a sensor built into the Watch or the watch�s band that could use infrared to build a thermal image of your wrist and its identifying traits (like skin texture/arm hair) to identify who is wearing it � sort of like a fingerprint, but from your wrist.Unlike most of Apple�s other devices, the Apple Watch doesn�t currently have any sort of built-in biometrics for unlocking � there�s no thumbprint sensor for Touch ID, or camera for Face ID. Unlocking your Apple Watch means poking at the screen to punch in a PIN (or, if you�ve configured it to unlock when you unlock your phone, doing that). A sensor setup like this could make the unlocking process automatic without the need to unlock your phone.The second granted patent describes a Watch band that can adjust itself on the fly � think Nike�s self-tightening shoes, but on your wrist. If the Watch detects that it�s sliding while you�re running (or if the aforementioned thermal sensors need a closer look at your wrist skin) tensioners in the device could tighten or loosen the band on command.Finally, a third granted patent tinkers with the idea of a Watch band with built-in light-up indicators � like, say, a notification light for incoming texts, or a meter that fills up to tell you at-a-glance how much distance you�ve got left on your run, or a stripe that glows yellow when you�ve got something on your calendar in the next hour. All of this can already be done on the Watch�s screen, of course � this would just allow for it without having to power up the entire display.As always, it�s worth noting that patents being granted doesn�t guarantee that any such features will make it to the final product � just that Apple found something cool in its R&D labs, and decided to lock it down.Apple has kept its bands relatively simple so far for the sake of keeping them swappable; they come in all sorts of materials and colors, but the electronic bits are contained within the Watch itself. Adding sensors and indicators to the band complicates that. As the user you�d have to decide: do you want the band you like the most on your wrist, or the one with the fancy notification lights?",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/apple-patents-watch-band-that-could-id-you-from-your-wrist-skin/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2906,YouTube says it deleted 5 times more hate content in June quarter,"Video-sharing platform YouTube has revealed that it deleted five times more hateful content in the quarter ending June, relative to the previous quarter. This included over 1 lakh videos, more than 17,000 channels and nearly double the number of comments to over 50 crore. YouTube added that more than 80% of the auto-flagged videos were removed without a single view.",TechCrunch,"In an update today, YouTube is claiming to have made significant progress in removing harmful video on its platform following a June update to its content policy which prohibited supremacist and other hateful content. The company says it has this quarter removed over 100,000 videos and terminated over 17,000 channels for hate speech � a 5x increase over Q1. It also removed nearly double the number of comments to over 500 million, in part due to an increase in hate speech removals.The company, however, is haphazardly attempting to draw a line between what�s considered hateful content and what�s considered free speech.This has resulted in what the U.S. Anti-Defamation League, in a recent report, referred to as a �significant number� of channels that disseminate anti-Semitic and white supremacist content being left online, following the June 2019 changes to the content policy.YouTube  CEO Susan Wojcicki soon thereafter took to the YouTube Creator blog to defend the company�s position on the matter, arguing for the value that comes from having an open platform.�A commitment to openness is not easy. It sometimes means leaving up content that is outside the mainstream, controversial or even offensive,� she wrote. �But I believe that hearing a broad range of perspectives ultimately makes us a stronger and more informed society, even if we disagree with some of those views.�Among the videos the ADL had listed were those that featured anti-Semitic content, anti-LGBTQ messages, those that denied the Holocaust, featured white supremacist content and more. Five of the channels it cited had, combined, more than 81 million views.YouTube still seems to be unsure of where it stands on this sort of content. While arguably these videos would be considered hate speech, much seems to be left online. YouTube also flip-flopped last week when it removed then quickly reinstated the channels of two Europe-based, far-right YouTube creators who espouse white nationalist views.Beyond the hate speech removals, YouTube also spoke today of the methodology it uses to flag content for review.It will often use hashes (digital fingerprints) to automatically catch copies of known prohibited content ahead of it being made public. This is a common way platforms remove child sexual abuse images and terrorist recruitment videos. However, this is not a new practice and its mention in today�s report could be to deflect attention from the hateful content and issues around that.In 2017, YouTube said it also increased its use of machine learning to help it find similar content to those that have already been removed, even before the videos are viewed. This is effective for fighting spam and adult content, YouTube says. In some cases, this also can help to flag hate speech, but machines don�t understand context, so human review is still required to make the nuanced decisions.Fighting spam is fairly routine these days, as it accounts for the majority of the removals � in Q2, nearly 67% of the videos removed were spam or scams.Moe than 87% of the 9 million totals videos removed in Q2 were removed by automated systems, YouTube said. An upgrade to spam detection systems in the quarter led to a more than 50% increase in channels shut down for spam violations, it also noted.The company said that more than 80% of the auto-flagged videos were removed without a single view in Q2. And it confirmed that across all of Google, there are over 10,000 people tasked with detecting, reviewing and removing content that violates its guidelines.Again, this over 80% figure largely speaks to YouTube�s success in using automated systems to remove spam and porn.Going forward, the company says it will soon release a further update to its harassment policy, first announced in April, that aims to prevent creator-on-creator harassment � as seen recently with the headline-grabbing YouTube creator feuds�and the rise of �tea� channels.YouTube additionally shared a timeline of its content policy milestones and related product launches.The update from YouTube comes at a critical time for the company, just ahead of a reported $200 million settlement with the FTC over alleged violations of child privacy laws. The fine serves as a stark reminder that, for years now, the viewers of these hate speech-filled videos haven�t only been adults interested in researching extremist content or engaging in debate, but also millions of children who today turn to YouTube for information about their world.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/youtube-claims-it-removed-5x-more-hateful-content-in-q2-including-100k-videos-17k-channels/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2915,"Google acknowledges Calendar spam issue, says a fix to come",Google has said it is aware of the spam issue on its Calendar after Gmail users complained of getting unsolicited Calendar invites aimed at redirecting them to phishing websites. The issue was experienced by users who have their Google accounts set to automatically add and notify them of Calendar invites. Google has said it is working to fix the issue.,Engadget,"Since at least May of this year, malicious individuals have been sending Gmail users unsolicited Calendar invites. The scam takes advantage of the fact most people have their Google accounts set to automatically add and notify them of Calendar invites. Since these invites can include an accompanying URL, scammers will use Calendar as a Trojan Horse to get individuals onto a phishing website. With the summer winding down, Google now says it's working on a fix for the oversight.On its official support forum, the company writes it's ""aware of the spam occurring in Calendar,"" and notes that it is ""working diligently"" to resolve the issue. At the moment, however, there's no estimated timeline for when people can expect a fix.In the meantime, you can easily protect yourself against this type of spam by changing how GCal handles event invitations. On a desktop browser, visit the Google Calendar website and click on the cog icon to open the app's settings menu. Then click on ""Event settings"" and find the option labeled ""Automatically add invitations."" When you click on it, a drop-down menu with three options will appear. For the time being, the one you want to enable is ""No, only show invitations to which I have responded.""As a further precaution, you'll also want to prevent Calendar from automatically adding events from Gmail. To do this, click on the ""Events from Gmail"" heading, then uncheck ""Automatically add events from Gmail to my calendar."" At this point, Google will warn you that this will prevent Calendar from automatically adding events from Gmail, in addition to removing any previously added events. Click okay.Unfortunately, neither of these precautions are ideal, as they limit some of the more useful functionality that's available in Google Calendar, but with how frequent these scams have become, better safe than sorry.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/03/google-calendar-fix-malicious-spam/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

WhatsApp said, ""It's false to claim there's a known bug within WhatsApp impacting users currently."" The iOS vulnerability had let hackers use websites to implant malware on devices and access information like passwords and bypass end-to-end encryption on third-party apps like WhatsApp.",The Financial Express,"WhatsApp users are recommended to be cautious as security experts have issued a warning after a new bug has been detected. The new bug allows hackers to access WhatsApp chats of users which puts their privacy at great risk. Google�s Project Zero team discovered the threat and revealed that iOS users are under threat after if they visit one of the compromised websites. The researchers went on to explain and added that iOS users will have to make sure that they do not log on to any unauthorised websites as it can allow hackers to gain access to users� photos, location and other important details via a keychain implant that can bypass encryption on messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and more. As many as five different iPhone exploits have been unearthed by Google�s Threat Analysis Group (TAG).Facebook-owned WhatsApp has always endorsed itself as a messaging platform which banks on end to end encryption. The encryption allows users to be sure of privacy and be confident no one else can read or have their way into the chats. But the recent revelations have come as a shock that could comprise privacy of a huge fraction of users. According to a report by Statista, WhatsApp has over 1.5 billion users across the globe who use the app every month.�WhatsApp cares deeply about the privacy of our users.

2944,"We're not burning money anymore, generating profit now: MobiKwik CEO","Bipin Singh, the Co-founder and CEO of Gurugram-based 10-year-old mobile payments startup MobiKwik, has claimed the startup isn't burning money and generating a profit excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. MobiKwik says it cut down on cashbacks and stopped participating in the race to aggressively acquire users. MobiKwik has raised about $118 million to date.",TechCrunch,"Indian mobile payments firm MobiKwik  has reached a milestone very few of its local rivals can even contemplate: not burning money. The 10-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered firm said Tuesday it is now generating a profit excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.�We have been in an ecosystem where we have seen a lot of high-growth and several regulatory changes in the payments domain. But what we realized was that payments alone is likely not going to be a very profitable business,� Bipin Singh, co-founder and CEO of MobiKwik, told TechCrunch in an interview.To get to the path of profitability, MobiKwik has made a number of significant changes to its business in recent years. It stopped participating in the race to aggressively acquire users and fighting with heavily backed firms such as Paytm, which has raised more than $2 billion to date.Paytm remains unprofitable and an analysis of its financial performance shows that this is not going to change anytime soon. Google,  which also offers a payments service in India, has no shortage of cash, either. MobiKwik has raised about $118 million to date from Sequoia Capital, American Express and Cisco Investments, among others.Upasana Taku,  co-founder and COO of MobiKwik, said the company has taken inspiration from Kotak and ICICI banks, both of which have about 15 million to 20 million customers � a fraction of many digital payment apps � but are profitable. MobiKwik, which employs 400 people, has 110 million users, she said.In the last two and a half years, MobiKwik has cut down on cashbacks it bandies out to users � a practice followed by every company offering a payments solution in India � and focused on building financial services on top of its wallet app to retain customers and find additional sources of revenue.The company continues to focus on its mobile wallet and payments processing businesses that account for about 75% of its revenue, but its growing suite of financial services, such as providing credits and insurance to customers, is already bringing the rest of the revenue, she said.That�s not surprising, as India remains alarmingly under served. Fewer than 50 million credit cards are in circulation in the nation currently, and for people with limited income, getting a loan of any size remains a major challenge.�Even the population that has access to smartphones and cheap internet data can�t get a credit card in India. We found it a good match for the growth of our payments app. We started serving these users who have the discipline to repay money and have certain kind of income,� the couple said, who are now also donning the role of angel investors.MobiKwik works with banks and other lenders to finance loans between Rs 5,000 ($69) to Rs 100,000 ($1,380). In the 18 months since it started offering this, MobiKwik has provided 800,000 loans and disbursed $100 million.In late 2018, the company launched �sachet-sized� insurance plans to provide protection from cyber fraud, fire, accident and hospitalization. These sachets start at as little as Rs 20 (28 cents) and thousands of users buy these everyday. Similarly, it also allows users to buy mutual funds for as little as $1.30.MobiKwik expects its revenue to hit $69 million in the financial year that ends in March next year, up from $28 million a year earlier. The company, which expects to turn fully profitable by fiscal year 2021, plans to go public in four to five years, Taku said.MobiKwik competes with a number of players, many of which are increasingly adding financial services, such as loans, to their platforms. Since these digital platforms are able to process loans without the need of salespeople and support staff, it becomes feasible for banks to chase customers with weak financial power.India�s overall retail credit demand is expected to grow 60% to $771 billion over the next four years, according to the Digital Lenders Association of India.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/mobikwik-ebidta-positive/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

If you hear the audio, someone (the village head�s representative who has been charged and arrested) is calling him and saying come here and make a viral video and come and be part of a conspiracy.�He added that the print journalist need not have taken videos and just taken some photographs and written about like- which according to Patel, now tantamounts to conspiring against the government.Meanwhile, over 100 journalists protested at the Mirzapur collectorate officer over the FIR filed against their colleague.",https://www.india.com/news/india/take-photos-why-make-a-video-up-govt-reasons-booking-journalist-for-mid-day-meal-story-3763646/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Authorities alleged that the world's largest brewer evaded local taxes. The court told AB InBev that the appeals process before Delhi authorities must first be completed.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Tuesday rejected a request from Anheuser-Busch InBev to stay a three-year sales ban imposed by New Delhi city authorities, dealing another setback for the world�s largest brewer in one of the country�s key markets. Authorities in New Delhi barred AB InBev in July from selling its beer in the New Delhi market on allegations of evading local state taxes. The company has denied the allegations. The state�s excise commissioner, who is already hearing an appeal against the ban order, had rejected a request from the company to hold off implementing the ban, Reuters reported last month. The company�s plea against the city government was heard at the Delhi High Court on Tuesday, where Justice Navin Chawla declined to give any immediate relief and said the appeals process before the state authorities must first be completed. �Why have two parallel proceedings,� said Chawla. The city government�s ban order followed a three-year investigation which found that beer maker SABMiller - acquired by AB InBev in 2016 for around $100 billion - used duplicate barcodes on its beer bottles supplied to city retailers that year, allowing it to pay lower levies. AB InBev, which counts popular beer brands such as Budweiser, Hoegaarden and Stella Artois in its portfolio, said on Tuesday it was contesting the allegations which were dated back to 2016, before its takeover of SABMiller. �It is our understanding that appropriate excise duty payments were made. We are committed to operating with integrity and high ethical standards,� the company said in a statement to Reuters. On Tuesday, the Delhi city government�s counsel referred to the case as one involving �clandestine� dealings, arguing that the brewer had not completed its appeals proceedings with the state which will next be heard on Sept 9. AB InBev�s counsel Rajiv Nayar, however, argued for immediate relief, saying the brewer was suffering due to the ban as it could not apply for state licences for the next year. Though Justice Chawla did not agree to give any relief for now, he said he viewed the case as one in which the city government acted beyond its authority in banning AB InBev. He will next hear the case on Sept 16. AB InBev is the second biggest player in India�s $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5% market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. Among those sitting in a packed New Delhi courtroom was AB InBev�s vice president for legal & corporate affairs for South Asia, John K. Johnson, who took notes and flipped through legal documents during the hearing. Industry executives have said the Delhi ban would be a major setback for AB InBev, which is also battling a separate Indian antitrust probe concerning alleged beer price fixing by SABMiller and other companies.

It even references a codename for one device, Garta, that might be linked to the previously rumored T288 project.Earlier stories have painted varying pictures of what Apple is working on.  Rumors from 2018 suggested it could be a powerful AR/VR device with 8K displays for each eye, but more recent reports have hinted the headset could be dependent on an iPhone.Whatever the plans may be, more than one source has claimed that the headset could be available as soon as 2020.

2972,Huawei denies accusations that it stole Portuguese inventor's tech,"Huawei has denied allegations that it stole a Portuguese inventor's technology, accusing him of ""taking advantage of the current geopolitical situation"". The claims are reportedly being investigated by the US Justice Department. ""For the past several months, US government has been leveraging its political and diplomatic influence to lobby other governments to ban Huawei equipment,"" Huawei said.",The Financial Express,"Beleaguered Chinese telecom giant Huawei on Tuesday denied accusations reported in the Wall Street Journal that it stole technology from a Portuguese inventor, accusing him of �taking advantage of the current geopolitical situation.�� The US Department of Justice is looking into the claim, potentially adding to existing criminal cases against Huawei, the WSJ reported last week.Huawei � considered the world leader in superfast 5G equipment and the world�s number two smartphone producer � was in May swept into a deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington, which has seen punitive tariffs slapped on hundreds of billions of dollars of two-way trade. The latest controversy involves Portuguese inventor Rui Pedro Oliveira who claims Huawei met him and then essentially ripped off one of his designs in order to produce the Huawei EnVizion 360 panoramic camera.�These allegations are false,� Huawei said in a statement in which it �categorically rejects Mr. Oliveira�s claims of patent infringement�. �For the past several months, the US government has been leveraging its political and diplomatic influence to lobby other governments to ban Huawei equipment.Furthermore, it has been using every tool at its disposal � including both judicial and administrative powers, as well as a host of other unscrupulous means � to disrupt the normal business operations of Huawei and its partners,� the Chinese company said. It said �Oliveira proceeded to feed a false narrative to the media in an attempt to tarnish Huawei�s reputation. He made further efforts to exert pressure on Huawei through senior government officials, trying to make the company cede to his demands and hand over large sums of money.�The United States is pressing allies, with mixed success, to reject Chinese 5G technology, especially from the giant mobile phone company Huawei. Washington fears that Huawei will provide Beijing with a way to spy on communications from the countries that use its products and services.Huawei admitted meeting with Oliveira in 2014 but insisted that its EnVizion 360 camera was �independently designed and developed by Huawei�s employees having no access to Mr. Oliveira�s information�. Last month the US Commerce Department effectively suspended for a second time tough rules stopping the sale of components and services to the Chinese telecoms titan and a prohibition on buying equipment from it.However, it also said it would add 46 more companies to its list of Huawei subsidiaries and affiliates that would be covered by the ban if it is implemented in full � taking the total on the list to more than 100.

Uber had moved a Bermuda subsidiary that owns intellectual property to the Netherlands. It claimed that this led to an increase of $6.1 billion in ""foreign tax assets"".",Reuters,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The top Dutch tax politician has denied meeting representatives of Uber Technologies, in answer to questions from parliament about why the company has been allowed to claim a provisional $6.1 billion tax write-off in the Netherlands. The remarks by State Secretary of Finance Menno Snel come as the Dutch government has embarked on a campaign to reform its reputation as an enabler of tax avoidance by multinationals. �We do not systematically track contacts between (tax) officials and...companies, but in general it is true that such contacts take place,� Snel said in a letter to parliament published on Friday. �For myself, I can say that I have not had contact with an Uber representative.� In an Aug. 9 SEC filing, Uber said it had moved a Bermuda subsidiary that owns intellectual property to the Netherlands, �primarily to align its structure to its evolving operations.� San Francisco-based Uber headquarters its international operations in Amsterdam, where it now has more than 1,000 employees. The company said the intellectual property move led to an increase of $6.1 billion in �foreign tax assets� � that is, investment costs that can be deducted from eventual profits. On Aug. 8 Uber reported a core operating loss of $656 million. Uber disclosed in June that its 2013-2014 tax filings are being audited by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and its taxes for 2010-2019 remain unresolved in multiple jurisdictions including the Netherlands. Snel said in answer to questions from lawmaker Pieter Omtzigt that �in general� intangible assets could be amortized in the Netherlands, offsetting profits earned here. But he declined to comment on any specific case. Oxfam tax expert Francis Weyzig said on Monday Snel�s comments were remarkable as they seemed to show a �lack of urgency� about cracking down on tax avoidance. He said Snel�s answers suggest that not only can companies seek formal advice from the government in the form of �advance tax rulings�, they can also seek informal advice, as Uber appears to have done. �It would surprise me if Uber were the only one doing this,� Weyzig said. The finance ministry could not immediately be reached for comment. An Uber spokeswoman said on Monday the company is �committed to openness and transparency with tax authorities around the world.� Uber is �faithful to both the letter and intent of the laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate,� she said.

""I put a lot of myself in the film. When I was building the character, I put a lot of my thoughts in presenting her. My character is a public prosecutor. Practically, public prosecutors don't earn a lot unless they are at the top of the game. So, why is she so adamant about getting justice in this case? That is where I channelised a lot of righteous anger I feel as an individual in the present situation. I feel angry at the sexism in our film industry, as well as in society.

According to the actress, she has a certain process of building a character by using her imagination to create a backstory. Giving an example, she explained: ""Since Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!�was my debut film, I made up a backstory of my character Dolly. I asked questions in my mind such as where did she grow up, what kind of friend circle she has, which dialect does she speak in, and what kind of food she prefers to eat. Although she does not know how to speak in English, she tries, and that is why she speaks wrong English.""

""Yet, I have used these elements in a way that the audiences do not pity her, because this wrong English-speaking is coming from a certain innocence.

A United Nations report seen by Reuters last month said North Korea had used �widespread and increasingly sophisticated� cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, amassing $2 billion which it used to fund weapons of mass destruction programmes.  �The United States and other hostile forces are now spreading ill-hearted rumors,�  North Korea�s state-run KCNA news agency reported, citing a statement from the spokesperson for the National Coordination Committee of the DPRK for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism. �Such a fabrication by the hostile forces is nothing but a sort of a nasty game aimed at tarnishing the image of our Republic and finding justification for sanctions and pressure campaign against the DPRK,� the statement said.

3027,"Xiaomi announces $1.5 billion share buyback, its biggest to date","Xiaomi on Tuesday announced that it will buy back up to HK$12 billion (over $1.5 billion) worth of stock in its biggest equity repurchase to date. The shares of the Chinese smartphone maker rose nearly 7% post the announcement. Xiaomi, which listed its shares in July 2018, has lost nearly a third of its market value so far this year.",Reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK) announced a HK$12 billion ($1.53 billion) share buyback plan on Tuesday, in a reversal of its cash-management strategy that is aimed at boosting its floundering stock.  Xiaomi shares responded to news of the buyback, its biggest, by climbing nearly 7%. Just last week the company scrapped an already delayed plan to offer equity in China, a move aimed at attracting mainland investors hungry to buy into global companies. The company said then it had enough money and would focus on business development. Shares of Xiaomi, which listed in Hong Kong last year, have     lost nearly a third of their value this year and are at half their initial public offering price, hurt by the company�s sharply slowing growth and increased competition. The stock has also been hit by losses at the Hong Kong stock market, which has plunged since massive anti-government protests started in the city in June. Companies on the city�s exchange have collectively bled $152 billion in value since June. �I think it should give investors more confidence to buy the stock because it shows how confident management is in the sustainable cash generating capabilities of the company,� said Morningstar analyst Dan Baker, referring to the buyback. Baker said the plan to offer shares in the mainland was likely aimed at getting a higher valuation in the Chinese market than it was about raising funds. The buyback announcement shows the company has enough cash, he said.  Xiaomi had cash and cash equivalents of 34.9 billion yuan ($4.92 billion) as of June 30 and total borrowings of 13.8 billion yuan. The company generated positive cash flow of roughly 11 billion yuan in the June quarter. �The board believes that a share repurchase in the present conditions will demonstrate the company�s confidence in its own business outlook and prospects,� Xiaomi said in a stock exchange filing. Xiaomi�s current financial resources will enable it to implement the repurchase while maintaining a solid financial position, it said. Growth at the Beijing-based company has slowed sharply as the global smartphone market has shrunk and local competition has increased. Xiaomi�s market share in China declined by a fifth in the April-June quarter even as that of smartphone giant Huawei Technologies  surged by 31%, according to research firm Canalys. Xiaomi�s efforts to push into higher-margin internet services - to complement razor thin margins on its smartphones - has also disappointed investors as it has struggled to wring more money out of its growing number of users. But its cheap smartphones have stayed popular among Indian consumers, who are buying more phones thanks to easier access to data. The company is also set to launch a consumer lending business in the country soon, but faces data privacy concerns and competition from U.S. tech giants. Xiaomi shares jumped as much as 6.8% to HK$8.92 on Tuesday.

The rain doused the fire after which they had to pour petrol on the pyre to burn the body.,The News Minute,"Only last week, a video shot on August 17 in Vellore District that showed a man's dead body being lowered from a bridge created massive debate on caste discrimination in Tamil Nadu and exposed how the discrimination extended even to the deadAs the video went viral and media attention grew, the district administration was forced to intervene and provide better facilties to Dalits. But in a tragic coincidence, even as this video was being shot in Vellore, over 500 kilometres away in Madurai, a similar case of �discrimination was unravelling.On the same day, members of the Adi Dravida community (Dalit Community) from Peraiyur village in Subbalapuram were carrying the corpse of 50-year-old Shanmugavel to their traditional burial ground, when it began to rain incessantly. Relatives of the deceased were left helpless as any fire they attempted to light, was doused in the downpour.""All their efforts proved to be futile,"" says Chellakannu, the state President of the Tamil Nadu Eradication of Untouchability Front. ""So they asked the caste Hindus if they could use their grounds to burn the body but they refused to let them in. This despite them explaining the problem at hand,"" he adds.While there are only 50 Dalit families in the village, there are over 150 caste Hindu families belonging to the Reddiyar community. According to Chellakannu, the two communities have separate burial grounds - the Dalits a bare patch of land and the caste Hindus a protected ground with sheds to burn bodies in. While the two grounds are attached, a tall compound wall surrounds the property of the caste Hindus.A video from the funeral shows relatives of Shanmugavel lamenting over how they had to burn the body amidst the rain. They further complain about the lack of infrastructure on their burial ground.�No dignity in death: Dalit community in Madurai struggles to conduct funeral in rain.

Please help our community,"" says one man, standing near the corpse and pleading with folded hands to the camera.Another man who claims to be the brother of the deceased however angrily proclaims, ""They are discriminating against us. They have all the facilities. Look at us, standing in the rain. He is my own brother. Look at their burial ground and look at ours. What is the government doing?""The Dalits with no other option in hand, then stood by the corpse covering it with a straw mat to keep the fire burning.""The fire was put off by the rain when the body was only half burnt and they had to pour petrol on it and burn it again,"" says Chellakannu.Later, the two communities went to the police station over the issue.""The dominant community complained to the police that we picked up a fight with them over the burial ground while we pointed that we were being discriminated against,"" says Chellakannu. ""But the police refused to register the complaint,"" he adds.When TNM contacted the Peraiyur inspector, he confirmed that no complaint had been registered in the case. He further propagated the existing caste divisions blaming the Dalits for trying to conduct the funeral in the caste Hindus' land.""We spoke to the two communities and settled the matter,"" he told TNM. ""The problem was because the Dalits tried to burn the body in another community's burial ground,"" he adds.This despite the Madras High Court questioning the Vellore district administration's decision to allot a separate burial ground for members of the Adi Dravidar Community after the first video went viral. The bench had slammed the government saying it was promoting caste segregation and questioned the need for establishing separate burial grounds.

Actress Nushrat Bharucha, an outsider who has made it big without banking on a filmi bloodline, however, defends the star kid brigade saying even star kids have had to prove their worth with acting skills and commercial value to get to the top of the entertainment business.

""Even star kids have had to prove their worth to be at the top of the game. Star kids might get great launchpads, but all of them have proved their worth commerciality and creatively,"" Nushrat, who will soon to be seen in the film Dream Girl, Nushrat told IANS.�

""We are in the business of entertainment where we have to make sure that we are either highly skilled with our acting, or we build such a connection with the audience that it can add commercial value to a film. That is why, though I am an outsider, I never felt victimised,"" she added.

Over the past couple of years star kids such as Sara Ali Khan, Janhvi Kapoor, Ishaan Khatter, Ananya Pandey, Meezan, Sharmin Sehgal, Pranutan and Abhimanyu Dassani being launched, and soon Karan Deol, son of Sunny Deol, will make his debut. Nushrat cites examples of Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan to explain how these young actors, despite belonging to illustrious Bollywood clans, are successful in their own right after proving their worth commercially and creatively.After her performance in Pyaar Ka Punchnama�(2011) brought praise and popularity, she was seen in films like Akaash Vani, Darr @ The Mall, Meeruthiya Gangsters.

""None of these films worked at the box office. Then Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2�and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety�released, and both worked for me. In between, I got a lot of character role offers but I was sure I only wanted to play the female lead. Instead of blaming the situation on why people are not writing roles for me, I grabbed the opportunity to prove the fact that even if I have five scenes, I will nail them with my performance,"" said Nushrat.

She also believes that it is in the hands of the performer to treat a character in a certain way. Recalling her popular character Sweety Sharma in Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, Nushrat said: ""In the film, I had a dialogue that said, 'main heroine nahin, villain hoon'. But in the end the audience liked my character because through my performance I did not play it black. It was grey.""

In her upcoming film Dream Girl, the actress plays the love interest of the male protagonist. She continued: ""I take up such challenges as an actress and make it real. It was a challenge for me to play a part in a film like Dream Girl�because the central character in the film is of Lokesh played by Ayushmann. People will come to the theatre to watch his story. My challenge is, in the end, when they leave the theatre, they should go back with my performance also in mind -- like the way people couldn't forget MC Sher in Gully Boy�although the film was about on Ranveer (Singh) and Alia (Bhatt),"" she shared.

The star said he ""abused all of his relationships"" and was being ""disrespectful to women.""""I became resentful and angry.

The technology would reportedly rely solely on the watch's motion, heart rate and noise detection to gauge the quality of sleep. Apple is reportedly planning on releasing a dedicated 'Sleep' app for the same.",Engadget,"The Apple Watch might include sleep tracking sooner than you think.  Sources talking to 9to5Mac claim to have significant details as to how the health feature will work, with word that it might be announced ""as early as next week"" at the September 10th event.  Some details aren't surprising, but they suggest this isn't just a throwaway addition.The technology would rely solely on the watch's motion, heart rate and noise detection to gauge the quality of your sleep.  You wouldn't need a Beddit sensor to fill in the gaps.  This isn't shocking (other wearables have done this), but there would be a dedicated Sleep app on the watch in addition to rest quality data in the Health app.  You'd get reminders to charge your watch before you tuck in for the night, a watch-only wake-up alarm (including vibration-only if you prefer), and you could even specify a designated watch just for bedtime.The main unknown: whether or not you'll need new wristwear.  Apple sometimes ties Watch features to new hardware and might have refresh devices on the way, but the sleep tracking as described doesn't sound like it explicitly requires an upgrade.  This doesn't mean that anyone running watchOS 6 will get sleep tracking.  It's just that existing users might not be in a rush to upgrade.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/02/apple-watch-sleep-tracking-details/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3058,Amazon allegedly found selling unlicensed signal boosters in US,"Global e-commerce giant Amazon was allegedly found selling unlicensed phone signal boosters in the US, the Wired reported. The unlicensed models often cost less than $200, compared to $300 or more for FCC-certified versions, the report claimed. American signal booster manufacturer SureCall claimed that reaching out to Amazon ""hasn't yielded results"" even after it was notified of the same.",Engadget,"Amazon has been found selling more than some unsafe products. Wired has learned that the internet retailer has been selling cell signal boosters without FCC licenses (such as those from MingColl, Phonelex and Subroad), including some marked as Amazon's Choice. The devices are not only unlikely to pass the registration process with carriers, but have caused service disruptions -- more than one buyer has received complaints from carriers after their boosters interfered with cell towers.  Call drops and disconnections are distinct possibilities.All of the six vendors spotted in the investigation appeared to be located in China with few if any contact details, and were using bogus reviews to give the appearance of popularity.An Amazon spokesperson said that selling partners had to ""comply with all relevant laws and regulations"" when listing goods for sale, and the company did remove some listings after Wired got in touch.  Some of the listings remained in spite of the notifications, though, and Amazon responded only by noting that its team members ""constantly review and refine"" the policies and methods used to ensure that products honor regulations.In the past, Amazon has argued that it's serving as a marketplace for these sellers and doesn't have to shoulder their legal obligations.  However, that still leaves it selling products that cause significant trouble for whole neighborhoods.  And while the Amazon's Choice label is automatically generated based on relevance to customer searches, it still implies a recommendation.  Amazon may have to take stricter actions against unlicensed boosters if it wants to avoid scrutiny from regulators and politicians.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/02/amazon-found-selling-unlicensed-cell-signal-boosters/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3062,German carpool app Wunder shuts down India biz in 2 years,"German carpool service Wunder Mobility has shut down its Indian business two years after its October 2017 foray. The startup took down its public app and stopped open platform operations in India from July 19, as per a notification sent to users, Entrackr revealed. Founded in 2014, Wunder secured a $30-million extended Series B funding round in September 2018.",Entrackr,"Sustaining carpool business in India is tough. It can be gauged from several failed attempts by local as well as global players. France-based global carpool major BlaBlaCar had wrapped up active operations in India at the beginning of 2017 while local startups failed to scale as they anticipated.Another attempt by German carpool service Wunder has failed to take off even after burning multi-million USD in the Indian market. The company had taken down its public app and stopped open platform operations in India from July 19, according to a notification sent by the firm to users.It was operational in Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai. Surprisingly, the company claimed to have a decent business till March this year. It�s not clear whether B2B operations of Wunder is active in India or not.Wunder started local operations in October 2017 and sustained it for about 21 months. According to an Inc42 report, the firm had raised $30 million in an extended Series B round in September last year. While we don�t know whether it was able to raise $30 million or not, it�s unlikely that the company will shut down Indian operations after raising a hefty sum.Wunder Mobility had joined the ranks of several companies who either shut down operations in India or on an autopilot mode. Rocket Internet-backed Tripda, Sharedcab and Lifto had shut down entirely while BlaBla and Togo have been running without the operational team in the country.Trust and security have been factors that make carpool business non-lucrative in India. Shared mobility platforms, including carpool services, were under close glare after several incidents of sexual harassments by drivers of Uber and Ola.Additionally, Indians consider carpooling very informal. This is the reason why we don�t see carpool as a popular medium for daily office commute (even with office colleagues).Unlike others who failed in carpool segment, Bengaluru-based Quick Ride has been able to make a significant dent. The company is operational in 10 cities including Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR. It had recently claimed to complete 21 million trips in the past four years.Quick Ride appears to be an exception, and it would be interesting to observe how it scales further without significant glitches.",https://entrackr.com/2019/09/exclusive-carpool-app-wunder-mobility-shuts-down-indian-biz/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

If these tensions increase, the world could be in danger,� Khan said, addressing members of the Sikh religious community in the eastern city of Lahore. �There will be no first from our side ever,� he said. The foreign ministry�s spokesman subsequently said on Twitter that the comments were being taken out of context and did not represent a change in Pakistan�s nuclear policy. �PM was simply reiterating Pakistan�s commitment to peace and the need for both nuclear states to demonstrate responsible behaviour,� spokesman Mohammad Faisal said on his official Twitter account. Tension remains high in Kashmir, where security forces have used tear gas against stone-throwing protesters and the valley remains under lockdown after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi�s decision to withdraw special rights for the Muslim-majority state on Aug. 5.  By stripping Indian-controlled Kashmir of its special status, New Delhi blocked the region�s right to frame its own laws and allowed non-residents to buy property there. Delhi said the change would help Kashmir�s development, to the benefit of all, but its move angered many residents of the region and was strongly condemned by Pakistan. Khan has so far focused on a global diplomatic campaign condemning India�s actions, accusing Modi of committing human rights violations and atrocities in the valley. He has also said frequently that any misadventure between two nuclear-armed nations could endanger the world. Muslim-majority Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan. Both countries rule parts of Kashmir while claiming it in full. Two of the three wars they have fought have been over it.

3086,Facebook may remove the number of Likes from News Feed,"Facebook has confirmed that it is considering to remove the number of Likes on News Feed posts, adding that it may soon test the feature. Reverse-engineering master Jane Manchun Wong spotted Facebook prototyping the hidden Like counts in its Android app. Facebook-owned Instagram is already testing this feature in seven countries.",TechCrunch,"Facebook  could soon start hiding the Like counter on News Feed posts to protect users� from envy and dissuade them from self-censorship. Instagram is already testing this in 7 countries including Canada and Brazil, showing a post�s audience just a few names of mutual friends who�ve Liked it instead of the total number. The idea is to prevent users from destructively comparing themselves to others and possibly feeling inadequate if their posts don�t get as many Likes. It could also stop users from deleting posts they think aren�t getting enough Likes or not sharing in the first place.Facebook prototypes hiding like counts [via Jane Manchun Wong]Reverse engineering master Jane Manchun Wong spotted Facebook prototyping the hidden Like counts in its Android app. When we asked Facebook, the company confirmed to TechCrunch that it�s considering testing removal of Like counts. However it�s not live for users yet. Facebook declined to share results from the Instagram Like hiding tests, its exact motives, or any schedule for starting testing. If it does decide to go ahead with a test, Facebook would likely do so gradually and pull back if it significantly hurts usage or ad revenue.Facebook prototypes hiding like counts [via Jane Manchun Wong]Instagram will now hide likes in 6 more countriesStill, the prototype might indicate positive results from hiding Like tallies in Instagram,  which we first reported in April after it was spotted by Wong there as well. After beginning testing in Canada later that month. Instagram added Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Ireland, and Japan to the test in July. There, a post�s author can still see the Like total, but everyone else can�t. The expansion of that Instagram test and Facebook potentially trying it in its own app signals that it might have positive or negligible impacts on sharing while aiding mental health, or at least be worth a slight drop in engagement.Instagram is already testing hiding Like counts and Facebook may soon do the same.Instagram is already testing hiding Like counts and Facebook may soon do the same.Facebook has gradually been relegated to the place for sharing showy life events like marriages or new jobs while Instagram and Snapchat take over for day-to-day sharing. The problem is that people have so many fewer of those big moments, and the large Like counts they attract can make other users self-conscious of their of own lives and content. That�s all problematic for Facebook�s ad views. Facebook wants to avoid scenarios such as �Look how many Likes they get. My life is lame in comparison� or �why even share if it�s not going to get as many Likes as her post and people will think I�m unpopular�.The difference between good and bad FacebookingRemoving Like counts could put less pressure on users and encourage them to share more freely and frequently, as I wrote in 2017. It could also obscure Facebook�s own potential decline in popularity as users switch to other apps.

3087,19-year-old boy suffers stroke due to PUBG addiction in Hyderabad,"A 19-year-old boy from Hyderabad suffered a stroke due to addiction to PUBG video game, doctors said. He was rushed to ICU of a private hospital after complaining of being unable to move his right arm and right leg. The boys' parents said he used to spend 8-10 hours daily playing PUBG without eating, sleeping or even drinking water properly.",The News Minute,"In an alarming incident, a teenager from Hyderabad was admitted to the Sunshine hospital in the city after suffering from a stroke. Doctors say the 19-year-old had been addicted to the video game PUBG as the result of which his health had been impacted, to the point that the teen developed a stroke. This incident comes as the latest in a string of such stories coming to light, which is leaving doctors and mental health experts increasingly concerned about the role of video games and technology on health.It all started on August 26 when the second year Bachelors� student was rushed to the ICU of the private hospital in the city after he had complained of being unable to move his right arm or right leg. Doctors in the emergency room examined him and suspected that despite his age, he was showing signs which corresponded to a brain stroke. Upon further investigation, the doctors at the hospital were able to confirm that he had developed multiple blood clots (thrombi) in the brain, which rendered him unable to move his right arm or leg.�It is extremely rare to see a stroke of this level in a person this young. However the teen had been leading such an inactive and unhealthy lifestyle. We were told by the parents that he spent at least 8 to 10 hours a day playing PUBG without eating, sleeping, or even drinking water properly. All of these factors combined have led to his condition,� said one hospital source.Dr K Vinod Kumar, a senior neuro-physician at the hospital told ToI that the boy had lost 3-4 kgs of weight in a month.A stroke is caused by disruption to the brain�s blood supply and is most commonly caused by a block to the blood vessels which are carrying nourishment and oxygen to the brain. This is called an ischemic stroke. These types of strokes are largely seen in the elderly, as a result of age related changes, however, leading a sedentary lifestyle without the proper diet and exercise can cause people to develop a stroke at much younger ages.While the teen has made recovery and was discharged on Saturday evening by doctors, the increasing number of children and teens becoming addicted to video games is a cause of concern that doctors want to highlight more.Seeing the rising trend of video game addiction, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the endemic of videogame addiction a mental health disorder in June 2018. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) it issued at the time listed gaming disorder as an addiction. The ICD states that any individual who prioritises gaming over all other activities in life, despite the consequences of such a lifestyle, should be treated.The National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru has been running its Service for Healthy Use of Technology (SHUT) Clinic since 2014 after mental health experts at the hospital took notice of the rising trend of video games and social media addiction. Dr B N Gangadhar, director of NIMHANS, has been vocal about the need for recognising the harmful impact of social media and gaming on young minds.�",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hyd-teen-suffers-stroke-due-pubg-addiction-experts-concerned-about-gaming-risk-108200?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The image database from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE camera indicated that SpaceX is mainly interested in Mars' Arcadia region. The region has both volcanoes and large open plains.,Times Now,"Washington:�Elon Musk is serious about colonizing Mars and his aerospace company SpaceX has requested NASA to provide it with potential landing sites on the Red Planet. SpaceX's HiRise images indicate it is interested in the Arcadia region of Mars, which has both volcanoes and large open plains.SpaceX is currently building two orbital prototypes and just completed a successful short jump of its Starhopper prototype as a test of its Raptor engine, reports CNET. SpaceX is building the ""Starship"" (formerly known as the BFR), a fully reusable vehicle designed to take humans and supplies to Mars.In an interview with Axios, Musk said that that there is ""70 per cent chance that he will go to Mars"", despite a ""good chance"" of him not surviving either on the way or after landing.Musk earlier floated the idea that making Mars warmer would be crucial for making it habitable for humans and one way of doing it would be launching thermonuclear weapons in order to create tiny ""suns"" over the regions.The idea is to convert any frozen carbon dioxide into gas, thereby engineering a greenhouse gas. Musk then floated a new theory, without abandoning the nuking Mars idea. ""Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd),"" he tweeted.""Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive,"" he added. Musk has already estimated the cost of having a self-sustaining civilization on the Red Planet which is ""between $100 billion and $10 trillion"".He arrived at the figure after estimating the approximate future cost of sending a minimum payload to Mars ""to nearest order of magnitude"", at $100,000 per tonne. So if building a self-sustaining city on Mars requires a million tonnes of cargo, the cost would be around $100 billion, Musk calculated.Companies such as SpaceX and scientific bodies around the world have been working towards inventing technologies to allow humans to venture beyond Earth's moon but it could still take a decade or more before that is attempted.",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/elon-musk-serious-about-colonizing-mars-scouts-for-potential-landing-sites-on-the-red-planet/480789?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3101,China lodges complaint in WTO against US over trade tariffs,China on Monday said it has lodged a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the US over its import duties on Chinese goods. The Trump administration's new 15% tariffs on several Chinese imports came into effect on Sunday. China argued the latest tariffs violated the consensus reached by leaders of the two nations at a meeting in Osaka.,Reuters,"HONG KONG/GENEVA (Reuters) - China has lodged a complaint against the United States at the World Trade Organization over U.S. import duties, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Monday. The United States began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods on Sunday and China began imposing new duties on U.S. crude oil, the latest escalation in their trade war. China did not release details of its legal case but said the U.S. tariffs affected $300 billion of Chinese exports.  The latest tariff actions violated the consensus reached by leaders of China and the United States in a meeting in Osaka, the Commerce Ministry said in the statement. China will defend its legal rights in accordance with WTO rules, it said. The lawsuit is the third Beijing has brought to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump�s China-specific tariffs at the WTO, the international organization that limits the tariffs each country is allowed to charge. U.S. officials say that they are penalizing China for theft of intellectual property that is not covered by WTO rules, although many trade experts say that any tariff hike above the allowed maximum must be justified at the WTO. Many experts also decry China�s decision to fight fire with fire, by imposing tariffs on U.S. goods imported into China, also without the WTO�s approval. On Friday the United States published a written defense in the first of the three legal cases, asserting that China and the United States agreed the issue should not be judged at the WTO. �China has taken the unilateral decision to adopt aggressive industrial policy measures to steal or otherwise unfairly acquire the technology of its trading partners; the United States has adopted tariff measures to try to obtain the elimination of China�s unfair and distortive technology-transfer policies,� it said. China had chosen to respond not by addressing U.S. concerns but with its own tariffs, �in an effort to maintain its unfair policies indefinitely�. The U.S. submission also said its actions were exempt from WTO rules because they were �measures necessary to protect public morals� - a clause used in the past to argue for trade restrictions over gambling, animal rights and public broadcasting. Under WTO rules, Washington has 60 days to try to settle the latest dispute. Then China could ask the WTO to adjudicate, a process that would take several years. It could end with China gaining WTO approval to take trade sanctions, if the United States is found to have broken the rules.

""There was time when a large number of people from Pakistan used to come here, especially on Sundays and holidays. After shopping or doing business, they loved to watch movies of stars like Nargis, Shammi Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand,"" he told IANS.

Old-timers recall that Raja Talkies used to get cinemagoers from Pakistan via the Hussainiwala check post till trade between both nations was open, up to the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Pakistanis were fond of Hindi movies and would come in droves to watch movies in the cinema hall then.

At that time, like Raja Talkies, other three cinema houses -- Joshi Palace, Shimla Talkies and Amar Talkies -- used to do brisk business.

After the Indo-Pakistan war in 1971, the Hussainiwala check post, 11 km away from here, was closed for the traders from Pakistan.

The strategically important Hussainiwala bridge was blown up during the 1971 war to stop advancing armoured units of the enemy. It was reconstructed and thrown open to the public on August 12, 2018, by the then Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Another town old-timer, Agya Ram Sharma, recalled that these theatres were also popular for screening English movies every Sunday which attracted a big audience of Army officers and their families stationed nearby.

The theatres also used to screen Pakistani dramas and family soaps, quite a hit among the Indian audience till early 1980's, he added.

While future plans for the theatre are not known, locals feel emotional about the local landmark that is going to be lost forever.

They have fond memories of going to the theatre to watch movies which were once a regular affair.�",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/punjabs-iconic-raja-talkies-that-was-once-a-rage-amongst-pakistani-cinemagoers-shuts-down/480970?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It will bring in greater transparency and provide richer information to filmmakers.""He congratulated CBFC for the effectiveness with which it has been discharging its functions. ""When cable television and later DTH was introduced, people never imagined that prices of TV channels can be so low, but it will soon happen after the order of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). These days, due to social media, with just one or two shows, it becomes clear whether a film will succeed or not,"" Javadekar added.Noting the importance of entertainment in modern life, the Minister made an appeal to all TV producers to use technology so that visually impaired people can understand the films better: ""Such technology can be used at a cost of 1 or 2 lakh rupees per film.

The theme of IFFI 2019 is 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'. The opening and closing ceremonies will reflect this theme. I appeal to all to come and attend it. As our Prime Minister said, the film is industry too; we are trying to have Film Business Summit, which will look into the business aspect of films. Film Bazaar is planned to be organized in Mumbai, which will look into business promotion, technology diffusion and export promotion.""Javadekar said that the Government is changing the Cinematograph Act, in order to curb piracy. Commenting on the new design, the Chairman, CBFC said: ""I believe design should reflect the contemporary digital world and leverage the ease that technology has brought in our work processes. The design change is not cosmetic; it is extremely functional and underlines CBFC's positive value-added approach.""The new design is futuristic in its approach and in sync with the new digital world. It is also interactive in its design sensibility: by scanning the QR code, more information on the certificate can be obtained online. Prasoon Joshi himself has conceptualised the new look.

3238,Paris testing 'noise radar' to automatically ticket loud cars,"Paris is testing a new 'noise radar' system that can identify noisy vehicles, pinpoint their location and automatically ticket them. The system uses four microphones to detect the origins of a sound. It then links it with police CCTV cameras to automatically issue tickets to offenders.",Engadget,"Parisians with powerful cars might want to think carefully before showing off their rides.  Parts of the city (most recently the suburb of Villeneuve-le-Roi) are testing a ""noise radar"" system from Bruitparif that can pinpoint loud vehicles and, eventually, ticket them.  The system uses four microphones to triangulate the origins of a sound and link it with CCTV footage to pinpoint whoever's making the racket.Just shy of 40 of the devices are in use so far, primarily near bars in Paris' entertainment regions as well as 17 around major buildings.The two-year trial isn't meant to fine anyone.  Rather, it's meant to both test the viability of the technology and determine the noise levels that lead to penalties.  However, people with souped-up rides might not want to get too comfortable.  A draft law due for a vote this fall will let local officials experiment with noise radar fines, and Villeneuve-le-Roi intends to take advantage of it if and when the law takes effect.  You might have one more incentive to drive a quiet EV -- you'll hardly make a sound even if you mash the throttle.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/31/paris-noise-radar/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The pub's floor manager confirmed the incident saying they don't allow women in sarees and hijabs as it's against the pub's 'dress code'. ""I've been there before with my mother who was wearing a saree,"" the woman's friend claimed.",The News Minute,"Miriam* was in for a rude shock when a manager at Air Live, a popular pub in Hyderabad asked her to remove her hijab, claiming the headscarf was not in accordance to the �dress code� followed at the place. While shoes for men is a common rule in many high-end pubs in the country, Miriam says this was the first time she was asked to remove her hijab, without taking into consideration her religious sentiments.Making it clear that this was a case of discrimination because of her religious clothing, the staff at the pub allegedly told Miriam and her friends that if she did not want to remove her hijab, they could sit on a sofa on the far end where they wouldn�t be �be visible� to others coming into the pub.On Friday, Miriam had come to Air Live, a posh pub in Hyderabad�s Jubilee Hills, along with her friend Kunal Pandey and another female friend. They were sitting at the bar counter when one of the managers approached Kunal and told him to ask his friend to go to the washroom and remove her hijab.�I was really surprised,� says Miriam, �I still do not understand why they thought Kunal had any kind of authority over me and why they didn�t consider confronting me directly on the issue.� The staff then continued addressing Kunal, she says.�I was shocked. I had been to Air Live a couple of times before, once even with my mother who was then wearing a saree. No one had then mentioned anything about a dress code. I told the manager that the rule was disgusting and everyone had the freedom to wear whatever they chose. He then asked one of the staff members to call the bouncers,� Kunal says.Kunal, an employee with an IT firm in the city, retorted saying there was no need to call bouncers as they were not planning to stay at the pub any longer.�I was infuriated and had an altercation with the manager. I told him that I would post about the incident on social media and that�s when the manager slightly mellowed down and another staff intervened. He said we could sit on a sofa, away from the bar counter, without having to remove the hijab. Miriam had by then left the pub and was looking for a cab,� Kunal adds.Miriam says that this isn�t the first time she has faced a similar situation for her choice of clothing. �A few years back, I was stopped at the entrance of a pub for wearing a hijab. The guard stopped me and said I couldn�t go inside because of the head scarf. My other friends have also faced similar situations and have dealt with a lot of glances and unwanted stares at public places,� Miriam says.Meanwhile, staff at Air Live says the �dress code� has been in place for a long time now. Speaking to TNM, a floor manager confirmed the incident and said according to their �dress code�, women are not allowed to wear sarees and hijabs inside the pub. �Men are also not allowed to come in chappals. We don�t allow such clothes at the pub according to our policy,� he said.Asked why they thought such a �dress code� was necessary at a pub, the manager said there was no one particular reason. �Dress codes are very common at posh pubs in the city and we are also following the same.�*Name changed",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/posh-hyd-pub-asks-woman-remove-hijab-says-it-s-against-their-dress-code-108187?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3257,"Greece to increase border patrols, deportations to curb migrant flows",Greece is to step up border patrols and speed up deportations in an effort to deal with an increase in migrant flows from neighbouring Turkey. This comes after a dozen migrant boats arrived in Greece within minutes of each other on Thursday in the first such mass arrival from neighbouring Turkey in three years.,Reuters,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece is to step up border patrols, move asylum-seekers from its islands to the mainland and speed up deportations in an effort to deal with a resurgence in migrant flows from neighboring Turkey. The government�s Council for Foreign Affairs and Defence convened on Saturday for an emergency session after the arrival on Thursday of more than a dozen migrant boats carrying around 600 people, the first simultaneous arrival of its kind in three years.  The increase in arrivals has piled additional pressure on Greece�s overcrowded island camps, all of which are operating at least twice their capacity. Arrivals - mostly of Afghan families - have picked up over the summer, and August saw the highest number of monthly landings in three years.  Greece�s Moria camp on the island of Lesbos - a sprawling facility where conditions have been described by aid organizations as inhumane - is also holding the largest number of people since the deal was agreed. On Saturday, the government said it would move asylum-seekers to mainland facilities, increase border surveillance together with the European Union�s border patrol agency Frontex and NATO, and boost police patrols across Greece to identify rejected asylum seekers who have remained in the country. It also plans to cut back a lengthy asylum process, which can take several months to conclude, by abolishing the second stage of appeals when an application is rejected, and deporting the applicant either to Turkey or to their country of origin. �The asylum process in our country was the longest, the most time consuming and, in the end, the most ineffective in Europe,� Greece�s deputy citizen protection minister responsible for migration policy, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, told state television. Responding to criticism from the opposition that the move was unfair and unlawful, Koumoutsakos said: �Asylum must move quickly so that those who are entitled to international protection are vindicated ... and for us to know who should not stay in Greece.� The government was �determined to push ahead with a robust returns policy because that is what the law and the country�s best interest impose, in accordance with human rights,� he said. Greece was the main gateway to northern Europe in 2015 for nearly a million migrants and refugees from war-torn and poverty-stricken countries in the Middle East and Africa.  A deal between the EU and Turkey in March 2016 reduced the influx to a trickle, but closures of borders across the Balkans resulted in tens of thousands of people stranded in Greece. Humanitarian organizations have criticized Greece for not doing enough to improve living conditions at its camps, which they have described as �shameful�.

Poland suffered some of the worst losses of World War II: about six million of its citizens were killed.",Times Now,"German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Sunday asked Poland's forgiveness for history's bloodiest conflict during a ceremony in the Polish city of Wielun, where the first World War II bombs fell 80 years ago.""I bow my head before the victims of the attack on Wielun. I bow my head before the Polish victims of Germany's tyranny. And I ask forgiveness,"" Steinmeier said in both German and Polish. Poland suffered some of the worst horrors of World War II: nearly six million Poles died in the conflict that killed more than 50 million people overall.That figure includes the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust, half of them Polish. ""It is the Germans who committed a crime against humanity in Poland. Anyone who claims it is over, that the national-socialists' reign of terror over Europe is a marginal event in German history judges that for himself,"" Steinmeier added in the presence of his Polish counterpart.The line appeared to be a clear reference to the German far-right, whose co-leader Alexander Gauland once called the 12-year Third Reich a ""speck of bird poop"" in an otherwise glorious German past. ""We will never forget. We want to remember and we will remember,"" Steinmeier said.Polish President Andrzej Duda for his part denounced Nazi Germany's attack on Poland, calling it ""an act of barbarity"" and ""a war crime.""

On September 17, the Soviet Union in turn invaded Poland.After the Nazis tore up the pact with Moscow, two alliances battled it out to the end: the Axis powers led by Germany, Italy and Japan and the victorious Allied forces led by Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States.Later Sunday, US Vice President Mike Pence, Steinmeier and Duda will deliver speeches at a ceremony in Warsaw's Pilsudski Square, the site of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.- No Johnson, Putin, Trump -Though it has been 80 years since the war started, there are still unresolved matters according to Poland, which says Germany owes it war reparations.A parliamentary commission is currently working on a new analysis of the extent of Poland's wartime human and material losses. Berlin, however, believes the case is closed.German Chancellor Angela Merkel will attend the Warsaw ceremony, but no other major world leaders are expected. US President Donald Trump had planned to attend the war commemorations but cancelled at the last minute so that he could monitor Hurricane Dorian.Also not attending are French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, while Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited -- unlike 10 years ago -- because of Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.The Polish presidency had said the commemorations would be attended by around 40 foreign delegations, a few of them led by heads of state.They include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky whose partnership matters to Poland, which believes its security depends on Ukraine remaining outside of Russia's sphere of influence.Duda said Poland wants neighbour ""Ukraine to be closer to the European Union, to be closer to NATO"" after meeting with Zelensky in Warsaw on Saturday.�",https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/germany-asks-polish-forgiveness-80-years-after-wwii-outbreak/480370?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3278,Want to meet people's expectations after 'Dangal': Nitesh Tiwari,"'Dangal' director Nitesh Tiwari has said that he doesn't feel the box-office pressure after the success of Dangal and that he only wants to live up to the expectations of people. The director further said that he never knew that 'Dangal' would become a ""huge success"". ""We felt that the story needed to be told,"" he added.",Times Now,"The 2016 Aamir Khan-starrer blockbuster Dangal�will stay in the hearts of many for its entertainment value.

The film's director Nitesh Tiwari returns with his next directorial, Chhichhore�soon. However, he isn't feeling the box-office pressure.""As far as the box-office is concerned, we didn't know Dangal would become such a huge success. We made Dangal�purely for the love of the story. We felt that the story needed to be told. We never kept the box-office result in mind, so there was never pressure when we made Dangal,"" Tiwari told IANS.""However, after the success of Dangal, the only pressure I would take would not be the box-office pressure. That would be unreal to have... to take that pressure. You can't say 'My film is going to perform so much at the box-office'. The only pressure and it is only human for me to feel that way is, I want to live up to the expectations of people. Whatever expectations they may have of me after Dangal. I hope I will be successful in exceeding their expectations.""After narrating the inspiring story of a wrestler in Dangal, Tiwari is set to take the audience back to his college days in Chhichhore.�Unlike Dangal, which had superstar Aamir, his new film has a young cast, including Sushant Singh Rajput, Varun Sharma, Tushar Pandey, Prateik Babbar and Shraddha Kapoor.On finalising the cast, he said: ""All of them needed to be great performers. It was something that was a given. The way I write most of my stories, there is a lot of scope for interesting performances. I was looking for people in a specific age category so that if I cut down a few years from them, they would look like college-going kids and if I add a few years, they would look like middle-aged people effortlessly. That's why I kind of migrated towards actors who are in their early 30s.""It is a college buddy film and the director has extracted a lot of stuff from his IIT days. Does it also deal with bullying?""It touches upon various aspects of college life and hostel life in a positive manner. It's all what I lived. We were made to feel extremely comfortable when we were juniors at IIT Bombay,"" he said of his time in the prestigious engineering institute where he even got to shoot a portion of the film.""I consider myself fortunate (to have got the chance to shoot inside IIT). I got to shoot where the germ (of the idea) originated. But mostly, I shot all over Mumbai,"" said Tiwari, a fan of shooting at real locations. That sadly, won't be possible for his next big-budget film.Tiwari and Ravi Udyawar � who directed Mom � are set to helm a 3D version of the Ramayan. With an estimated budget of Rs 500 crore, this will be a live-action trilogy in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.""The location doesn't exist, so I can't shoot in a real location. I'll have to create that,"" he said with a smile.The project is unlike any of his past films, in terms of genre or budget.
""Physically, it will be very different, but emotionally it follows the same pattern that I follow � (my films are) all great human stories. And Ramayan�is a fabulous human story on relationships,"" said the Chillar Party director.Why Ramayan�-- a story that has been repeatedly told, especially on the small screen?""I think we don't really remember too much of the Ramayan. What happened back then on TV was fine. Time has passed, many people only know Ramayan�at a surface level. If you dig deeper, it is far more beautiful than what it seems on the surface.

Absolutely p**s poor judgement,' he tweeted.Schwartz sent out a text he purportedly received from another reporter asking him if he had a few minutes to talk 'off the record.''This text was not from Rucker. It was from a reporter at another outlet reaching out about something completely unrelated to politics,' Schwartz wrote.'Rucker did some serious damage to his profession � none of these people can be trusted.

'What these don't show are the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday. This POTUS is working harder for the American people than anyone in recent history.'�Before Westerhout became Trump's personal secretary, she worked first for the Mitt Romney 2012 campaign, then the Republican National Committee, assisting its chief of staff�Katie Walsh.�But earlier this year it was reported that she had been in tears when Trump won - something which made others in the West Wing question her loyalty.When the election ended, she joined Walsh in New York. There the RNC chief of staff had Madeleine begin escorting visitors to Trump Tower, through the press and security in front.'Katie wanted me to make sure that these important people got inside the building and where they needed to be,' she told CNN.�'And then the President-elect wanted to make sure all of his meetings were very transparent, so it became a little bit more public than I originally thought it was going to be.'�Here are just some of the top officials who have left Trump's administration and when their departures were announced2017Inauguration Day was January 20January 31: Acting Attorney General Sally Yates�February 13: National Security Adviser Michael FlynnMarch 30:�Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh�April 9: Deputy National Security Adviser K.T.

3302,Audience wants chilled-out guys like Ayushmann: Nadiadwala,"Producer Sajid Nadiadwala said in an interview that earlier actors used to have a starry image which wouldn't work now and added, ""Today the audience wants chilled-out and relaxed guys. Ayushmann Khurrana is working big time."" Nadiadwala said that actors today have ""no extra charisma off-screen."" ""Earlier...[I]f an actor became ill or injured, fans would commit suicide,"" he further added.",Times Now,"These days, content, more than a films star, mostly draws people to the theatres, feels veteran producer Sajid Nadiadwala.

""The audience has changed. Earlier, there used to be undying fans. If an actor became ill or injured, fans would commit suicide by setting fire on themselves or jumping off. I remember I had been to Bangalore when Amit ji (Amitabh Bachchan) was injured. People went into mourning. They broke bangles, stood in long queues outside temples to pray for him. Even Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai was shut. But today content is the king. People are going for content, the audience wants this change,"" Nadiadwala said.

He added: ""Earlier, they (actors) would have a starry image. That would not work now. Today the audience wants chilled-out and relaxed guys. Ayushmann (Khurrana) is working big time. Look at every actor of these days, there is no extra charisma off-screen. If you have great content, if you are nice with the media, the audience, and your fans, that works. The attitude and arrogance of that generation wouldn't work now.""

Nadiadwala, who has traditionally worked with big stars and mega budgets, has now produced a relatively modest film, Chhichhore.

Talking about Chhichhore,�he said: We had discussed this film before Dangal�and started working on it after the release of Dangal. Today I can happily say that it is one of my finest products till date. The audience will be surprised after watching the film because the trailer does not give away even five percent of the story.""

Although Nadiadwala acknowledges the growing importance of content-driven commercial cinema as Chhichhore, he points out in the same breath that star power is not fading away.

""Star power ensures a film opens well (at the box office). Star power opened a (film like) Mission Mangal. It has done (business worth) Rs 200 crore. So, star power is always there,"" he said.

He recalled the days when today's superstars like Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan were struggling to craft a position for themselves in the industry.�

Nadiadwala, who has produced some of Salman's early movies like Jeet,�Judwaa,�and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega,�and hits like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi�and Jaan-E-Maan,�which starred Salman with Akshay, said: ""I have always made films with actors who became superstars. Akshay's (Kumar) first or second film was mine. We met in school, then in college and then in our struggling days. There were many films with Salman (Khan), too. Eventually, they became stars.""

Nadiadwala's upcoming biggies include the Salman-starrer Kick 2, and Housefull 4,�starring Akshay Kumar. He also produces 83, about India's 1983 World Cup win, starring Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone.

For now, however, Nadiadwala is gearing up for the September 6 release of Chhichhore. The film stars Sushant Singh Rajput, Shraddha Kapoor, Varun Sharma, Prateik Babbar, Tahir Raj Bhasin and Naveen Polishetty in key roles.

3308,Tencent no longer investing $150 million in VIPKid: Reports,"Tencent will no longer invest about $150 million to lead a fresh fundraising round for Chinese education firm VIPKid, reports said. This comes after tighter regulations by Beijing in the online education industry which require certifications for tutors working on the platforms and increased transparency of foreign tutor's past work. VIPKid reportedly hopes for a valuation of $4.5 billion.",Reuters,"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Tencent (0700.HK) has shelved plans to invest about $150 million to lead a fresh fundraising round for Chinese education firm VIPKid, two people with knowledge of the matter said, as Beijing tightens oversight of online education platforms. VIPKid dismissed the news as untrue and said it was in fundraising talks with Tencent and other investors. Tencent did not respond to a request for comment. According to the people, the Chinese tech giant had given a verbal nod for the investment and VIPKid had hoped this would help lure others to the fundraising that would value the company at $4.5 billion prior to the financing round. But Tencent scrapped the plans after Beijing last month issued regulations targeting online education platforms, stipulating teachers need to hold valid teaching qualifications and the firms must publicize information such as foreign teachers� certificates and work experience, one person said. VIPKid had initially wanted to raise $500 million but later lowered its target to more than $150 million, the people added.  VIPKid, in an emailed statement to Reuters, said it has a deep partnership with Tencent as an �advisor, investor and role model�. �While the details of any fundraising are of course confidential, we can confirm that Tencent, along with several leading investors are currently in fundraising conversations with VIPKid. Any media reports to the contrary are completely false and we look forward to correcting the record.� Tencent�s move to scrap the investment indicates how, amid stricter regulations, investors may be getting cold feet about China�s online education industry, which has seen a proliferation of new start-ups on strong demand for extracurricular training from parents. The education market for kindergarten to 12 years of age in China is forecast to be worth 64.88 billion yuan ($9.15 billion) this year, according to research firm iResearch.  Beijing-based VIPKid is an online education platform that connects children in China with native English-speaking teachers in the United States and Canada for live video lessons. It was set up in 2013 and employs more than 70,000 teachers. In June last year, it raised $500 million from investors including Coatue Management, Tencent and Sequoia Capital China, which valued VIPKid at about 20 billion yuan ($2.8 billion).  One of the sources said some of VIPKid�s investors had started to express concerns about its ability to narrow losses and start turning a profit.  Chinese authorities are also increasing their scrutiny of the overall education sector amid concerns over unqualified teachers and a push for a �cleaner�, patriotic education system.  In August, lawyers, schools and teachers told Reuters that arrests and deportations of foreign teachers in China have soared this year amid the crackdown.

3310,Sudan's ex-President Bashir formally charged with corruption,A Sudanese judge formally indicted former President Omar al-Bashir on charges of possessing illicit foreign currency and corruption on Saturday. Bashir admitted to receiving $25 million from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and added that he did not use it for his own benefit. Sudan's military ousted and arrested Bashir in April after a mass protest in the country.,Reuters,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A Sudanese judge on Saturday formally indicted Omar al-Bashir for possessing illicit foreign currency and corruption, charges the ousted leader challenged as he was publicly questioned for the first time since his overthrow. Bashir said that he had received $25 million from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as funds from other sources, but that he had not received or used the money for his own benefit. A lawyer for Bashir said that his client denied the charges against him and that witnesses for the defense would be presented at the next hearing. The judge denied a request for bail and said a decision on the duration of Bashir�s detention would be taken at a hearing on Sept. 7. Foreign currency held by Bashir was illicit and had been transferred illegally, he said. Millions of euros and Sudanese pounds were found at Bashir�s residence in April when he was toppled and arrested, a judicial source said at the time. Sudan�s military ousted Bashir after months of protests across the country. His prosecution is seen as a test of how far military and civilian authorities now sharing power will go to counter the legacy of his 30-year rule. Bashir, who appeared in traditional white robes in a metal courtroom cage and spoke slowly into a microphone, said his former office manager had received a message from Mohammed bin Salman�s office that a sum of money in euros worth $25 million would be sent by private plane for extra-budgetary needs. �It was not possible to present the money to the ministry of finance or the central bank because that would have required clarifying the source of the funds, and the Saudi prince asked that his name should not appear,� said Bashir. �I used the money for private donations to various parties,� including medical services, a university, an Islamic media channel, and the urgent provision of petroleum products, he said. Bashir gave no date for the transfer. Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bashir said he had also received more than five million Sudanese pounds ($111,110) from the head of a cereals company that provides much of Sudan�s flour, to be exchanged for foreign currency for flour imports.   The charges against Bashir carry maximum prison sentences of around 10 years.  Bashir was charged in May with incitement and involvement in the killing of protesters. The International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants against him in 2009 and 2010 on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Sudan�s Darfur region. A police detective told the court earlier this month that Bashir had acknowledged receiving millions from Saudi Arabia.

Defend our Democracy. Save our future,"" a sign read. PM Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.",Reuters,"LONDON/BELFAST (Reuters) - Thousands of people across Britain and Northern Ireland protested on Saturday against Prime Minister Boris Johnson�s decision to suspend parliament for about a month before the deadline for the country to leave the European Union. Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal on future relations with the bloc. The move to shut parliament for around a month in the period before that will hinder efforts by his opponents to stop him. About 2,000 people gathered outside his office in Downing Street, chanting: �Liar Johnson, shame on you!� A sign read: �#StopTheCoup. Defend our Democracy. Save our future.� The government says it is usual for parliament to be suspended before a new prime minister outlines his policy program in a Queen�s speech, now scheduled for Oct. 14. His supporters also say parliament usually breaks in late September, when the main political parties hold their annual conferences. But his critics say the suspension, known as a prorogation, is unusually long and describe the move as a thinly veiled attempt to reduce the time that lawmakers will have to debate before Britain leaves the EU at the end of October. Opposition lawmakers want to prevent the shutdown of parliament and pass legislation to avoid a no-deal Brexit when they return from summer recess on Tuesday. As well as London, protests were scheduled in other major cities in the four nations of the United Kingdom, comprising England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. About 100 people protested outside the city hall in Belfast, the capital of the Northern Ireland, which has become a particular focus in the Brexit negotiations as it has the United Kingdom�s only land border with the European Union. The �backstop� insurance policy, part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the EU and Britain�s former prime minister and which aims to keep the border with Ireland open, has become the main sticking point in negotiations. Johnson wants the backstop removed, saying it could leave Northern Ireland operating under different regulatory rules than the rest of the United Kingdom. The EU and Ireland say Britain has yet to come up with acceptable alternatives. A court case being heard in Belfast next week aims to block Johnson�s suspension of parliament on the grounds that a no-deal Brexit would breach the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the British-run province of Northern Ireland. Protesters said the government had failed to take into account the importance of the border issue. �The thing that scares me most is they have no appreciation of what is important for Northern Ireland. We are not on their radar,� said Graham Glendinning, 49, a software worker.  �The border means nothing to them and they don�t give two hoots about it.� Reporting by Peter Nicholls in London and Amanda Ferguson in Belfast; Additional reporting by Conor Humphries in Dublin; Writing by Alistair Smout; Editing by Edmund Blair",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-protests/thousands-protest-british-pm-johnsons-move-to-suspend-parliament-idUSKCN1VL0F2?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The residents of the six �more dangerous� provinces � Aleppo, Raqqa, Idlib, Homs, Hama, and Deir ez-Zor � can still expect asylum to be granted automatically. That will not be true for people living in �less dangerous� regions in the south, including Damascus, as well as in Latakia and Tartus on the Mediterranean coast, and the Kurdish-held northeast.�Their individual reasons [for applying for asylum] are now much more important than they were before,� the agency�s director of legal affairs, Fredrik Beijer, said.Now it will become very important who you are, where you come from, and what risk you are facing.Sweden is often considered as one of the most refugee-friendly nations as, in recent years, it has admitted more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU country.�The authorities have granted asylum to more than 115,000 people from Syria since 2011, after a civil war broke out there.There is an ongoing debate in Sweden whether the influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa has contributed to a spike in certain crimes, like gang violence, rape and sexual assault.Think your friends would be interested?

Vandana, the new mommy, is also extremely elated about welcoming Vanraj home. However, she expressed her ordeal and struggle in great lengths. Vandana said that when she was in the hospital during the treatment, she would feel depressed. However, it was the support from her husband that kept her going. She said, �Everything took a toll on me and I felt like I was having a breakdown. I prayed for strength and whatever the hardships, I knew I had to fight it out. I did not give up! What mattered was my child; the pain was nothing in front of this miracle baby, who fought for two-and-a-half months in the NICU. We have named him Vanraj Krishna Khattar; Vanraj is a combination of our names.� Rajesh and Vandana surely are proud parents of their baby as he has arrived home.

3356,Swiss at-home blood testing startup Baze raises $6 million,"First-ever at home blood-based nutritional testing kit startup Baze, has raised $6 million in Series A funding led by Nature's Way. Baze offers personalised subscription-based supplements to customers using blood samples. The Switzerland-based company aims to use the funds to create awareness about the importance of personalised supplements, and expand nutrient testing and supplement offerings.",TechCrunch,"By now, the venture world is wary of blood testing startups offering health data from just a few drops of blood. However, Baze, a Swiss-based personal nutrition startup providing blood tests you can do in the convenience of your own home, collects just a smidgen of your sanguine fluid through an MIT manufactured device, which, according to the company, is in accordance with FDA regulations.The idea is to find out (via your blood sample) which vitamins you�re missing out on and are keeping you from living your best life. That seems to resonate with folks who don�t want to go into the doctor�s office and separately head to their nearest lab for testing.Most health professionals would agree it�s important to know if you are getting the right amount of nutrition � Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide epidemic affecting calcium absorption, hormone regulation, energy levels and muscle weakness. An estimated 74% of the U.S. population does not get the required daily levels of Vitamin D.�There are definitely widespread deficiencies across the population,� Baze  CEO and founder Philipp Schulte tells TechCrunch. �[With the blood test] we see that we can actually close those gaps for the first time ever in the supplement industry.�While we don�t know exactly how many people have tried out Baze just yet, Schulte says the company has seen 40% month-over-month new subscriber growth.That has garnered the attention of supplement company Nature�s Way, which has partnered with the company and just added $6 million to the coffers to help Baze ramp up marketing efforts in the U.S.I had the opportunity to try out the test myself. It�s pretty simple to do. You just open up a little pear-shaped device, pop it on your arm and then press it to engage and get it to start collecting your blood. After it�s done, plop it in the provided medical packaging and ship it off to a Baze-contracted lab.I will say it is certainly more convenient to just pop on a little device myself � although it might be tricky if you�re at all squeamish, as you�ll see a little bubble where the blood is being sucked from your arm. For anyone who hesitates, it might be easier to just head to a lab and have another human do this for you.The price is also nice, compared to going to a Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp,  which can vary depending on which vitamins you need to test for individually. With Baze it�s just $100 a pop, plus any additional supplements you might want to buy via monthly subscription after you get your results. The first month of supplements is free with your kit.Baze�s website will show your results within about 12 days (though Schulte tells TechCrunch the company is working on getting your results faster). It does so with a score and then displays a range of various vitamins tested.I was told that, overall, I was getting the nutrients I require with a score of 74 out of 100. But I�m already pretty good at taking high-quality vitamins. The only thing that really stuck out was my zinc levels, which I was told was way off the charts high after running the test through twice. Though I suspect, as I am not displaying any symptoms of zinc poisoning, this was likely the result of not wiping off my zinc-based sunscreen well enough before the test began.For those interested in conducting their own at-home test and not afraid to prick themselves in the arm with something that looks like you might have it on hand in the kitchen, you can do so by heading over to Baze and signing up.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/30/at-home-blood-testing-startup-baze-rakes-in-6-million-from-natures-way/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

British media had reported that Javid was �livid� about the firing of his press aide by Johnson�s top adviser Dominic Cummings, who was looking into whether government officials had helped opponents of the premier�s Brexit plans. Javid said that though it would be inappropriate to directly discuss personnel issues, his views were �well understood� after the media reports. However, he said he got on well with Johnson.  �The relationship is fantastic with the prime minister,� Javid told BBC radio. �(He�s) someone I�ve always got on with incredibly well, and it�s been a real privilege to work with him so closely.� Javid would not be drawn on how well he got along with Cummings, but denied assertions by the opposition Labour party that Johnson�s aide was effectively running the Treasury. �The Labour party, they�re our opponents and they will say all sorts of nonsense all the time, and I�m used to it,� he said. Johnson gave Javid the finance portfolio when he came to office in July, and the apparent tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury come at a delicate time.  Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the European Union with or without a transition deal on Oct. 31, heralding a showdown with parliament, while his government also seeks to outline new domestic priorities. Javid is due to announce a one-year government spending plan on Wednesday with a focus on more funding for education, health and the police.  Johnson announced details of the rise in schools spending on Friday, while Javid announced 400 million pounds ($491.08 million) of investment for further education on Saturday. Javid said such moves were a sign of the smooth operation of government, which has a majority of just one in parliament. �From the moment this new government was formed, how much activity and focus has taken place, just in the last few weeks...

3379,Losing just 5 wickets on this track a good effort: Mayank,"After helping India reach 264/5 in the second India-Windies Test, batsman Mayank Agarwal said, ""We are in a great position. To have just lost five wickets on a track like that was a good effort from our side."" ""It just kept getting a little better to bat on, but I think credit must be given to Windies bowlers,"" Agarwal added.",Cricket Country,"Opener Mayank Agarwal accepted batting wasn�t an easy task on the opening day of the second Test against West Indies in Kingston but the fact that India lost just five wickets against some good bowling means they have done pretty well.INDIA vs WEST INDIES FULL SCHEDULE | LATEST NEWSWest Indies, trailing 0-1 in the two-match series, opted to bowl first hoping for their pacers to make an early impact. But the Indian opening pair of KL Rahul and Agarwal led an aggressive start before captain Jason Holder struck in the seventh over.READ: Kohli, Agarwal and Vihari keep India ahead despite Holder�s brillianceThe pacers kept a testing length while spinners, especially debutant Rahkeem Cornwall got plenty of purchase to keep Indian batsmen in check. However, half-centuries from Agarwal and captain Virat Kohli meant the tourists finished the day at 264/5 despite Holder�s 3/39.READ: An XI of portly (or heavier) international cricketers�I thought the first session � the ball was doing a bit,� Agarwal said after the end of day�s play. �Kemar Roach and Holder bowled great areas. It wasn�t easy � there was a lot of moisture and the ball was doing a bit. I think Holder is bowling great areas, he is not giving you an inch. He is there pegging in those areas, pegging on length and short of length. And you know he doesn�t give free deliveries for you to score.�
He added, �So, the pressure is always there even if you defend him off � the first spell he bowled six-seven overs in that he�s given three or four maidens, so as a batsman you know you�re not getting much out of him. We are in a great position. To have just lost five wickets on a track like that was a good effort from our side.�Batting on 53, Agarwal successfully overturned a caught-behind decision but was unable to capitalise on it as he added two more runs to his total before falling to Holder in the 41st over of Indian innings. When Agarwal fell, India were 115/3 before Kohli (76) combined with Rahane (24) and Hanuma Vihari (42*) to put his side in a relatively comfortable position.�I can say it got a little better to bat on after the first session, the wicket got a lot harder as the sun beat down, the wicket lost some of its moisture. It just kept getting a little better to bat on, but I think credit must be given to the West Indian bowlers, especially Roach and Holder � they kept coming and kept coming and kept bowling tight lines,� said Agarwal who recorded his third Test fifty.Offspinner Cornwall (1/69) left an impression as was evident from the 27 of the 90 overs he was asked to bowl on the opening day and managed to pick the important wicket of Cheteshwar Pujara (6). �Rakheem was very consistent, he forms good clusters and he keeps bowling those areas, keeps bowling those areas. I thought it wasn�t very easy to score off him. We took our time and it was very important for Virat and me to actually get a partnership going and it was important that one of us went on to score big. He definitely gets a lot more bounce compared to many other spinners.

""He has gone through a lot in his little time, but he can only get better from here,"" Pollard added about the suspension Hardik faced earlier this year.",Cricket Country,"India allrounder Hardik Pandya�s unabashed confidence, which many may feel at times borders on arrogance, is actually his biggest strength, feels West Indies allrounder and his Mumbai Indians teammate Kieron Pollard.Speaking to IANS, Pollard said that Hardik channelises his self-belief into creating magic moments on the field and the way the cricketer is able to focus on the job in hand even in trying situations shows his true mettle.�I have seen him from when he started at Mumbai and I am not surprised. He has turned into an Indian superstar. The way he carries himself and the manner in which Hardik plays emulates how he is off the field and sometimes when you see guys like that, we as individuals who are very conservative tend to always have negative things to say.�But, you know, when you are a confident person off the field and you can take that on to the field and perform, I think that shows great mettle in the human itself,� Pollard said of Hardik who is very close to the Trinidadian along with brother Krunal.Pandya�s fledgling career hit an all-time low when KL Rahul and he were suspended and sent back from the Australia tour in January over their comments on a chat show.Talking about Hardik�s talk show saga, Pollard said: �He has gone through a lot in his little time, but he can only get better from here. He puts in a lot of hard work. I am not overly surprised at what he is doing at this point of time.�Once the ban was lifted, Hardik made a strong comeback, especially with his performances in the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) where he scored 402 runs in 15 innings and took 14 wickets, including a 17-ball half century against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to help Mumbai Indians lift a record fourth title.Hardik also had a decent World Cup with both bat and ball as he helped India reach the semi-finals where they lost to New Zealand. Rested for the ongoing West Indies tour, Hardik has now been included in India�s T20I squad for the home series against South Africa next month.T20 specialist Pollard, 32, made a comeback into the West Indies team with the recently concluded three T20Is against India with scores of 49, 8 not out and 58. But he isn�t thinking too far ahead and wants to take each day as it comes.�It was good to make a comeback. For me, once I step on a cricket field, it�s always to perform to the best of my abilities for my team. Let�s see what the future holds in terms of international cricket,� he said.On West Indies cricket, keeping an eye on the T20 World Cup next year, Pollard said they have to meet expectations of being the defending champions.�We are defending champions so it�s always difficult. But again, when that time comes we cross that bridge. It�s a matter of trying to plan as best as possible and try to get that winning combination.�On the Selector Fan Cup, he said: �I am very excited. The concept is something that will happen for the first time. So hopefully we can go out and enjoy.�For any youngster who has the opportunity to rub shoulders with international superstars and past and present players will always be a learning experience.

3385,Google to pay up to $200 mn to settle FTC probe into YouTube,Google will reportedly pay between $150 million-$200 million to settle a Federal Trade Commission investigation into alleged violations of children's privacy laws on YouTube. Investigations found that Google collected data of children under the age of 13 who used YouTube. The complaints allegedly date back as far as 2015. The settlement has been sent to Department of Justice for review.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc�s Google (GOOGL.O) will spend up to $200 million to settle a Federal Trade Commission investigation into YouTube�s alleged violation of a children�s privacy law, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. Politico reported the settlement is expected to be between $150 million and $200 million. The settlement is set to be announced next week and will be the largest ever fine imposed for violating the Children�s Online Privacy Protection Rule by collecting personal information from kids without parental consent. Google declined to comment. The FTC voted 3-2 to approve the settlement and sent it to the Justice Department as part of the review process, Reuters confirmed, citing a person familiar with the matter. The Washington Post reported the settlement's approval in July but did not detail the amount of the civil penalty.(politi.co/2ZtIM5G) The settlement will far surpass the previous record set in February, a $5.7 million civil penalty imposed on Musical.ly, which did not ask for users� ages for three years. The online library for Musical.ly � now known as TikTok � features music popular with kids. Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, said Friday �the FTC appears to have let YouTube off the hook with a nominal fine for violating users� privacy online. And in this case, Google�s intrusions on kids� personal info are at issue. We must come down hard on companies that infringe on children�s privacy.� On Thursday, Google launched YouTubeKids. The company said it built the site �to create a safer environment for kids to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving parents the tools to customise the experience for their kids.� Parents can select from three different age groups to choose age-appropriate content - preschool, ages 5-7 and 8-12. Katharina Kopp, deputy director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said Friday �a settlement amount of $150-200 million would be woefully low, considering the egregious nature of the violation, how much Google profited from violating the law, and given Google�s size and revenue.� She added the fine �would effectively reward Google for engaging in massive and illegal data collection.�  In April 2018, the centre, joined by other groups, filed an FTC complaint alleging YouTube profited from kids �without first providing direct notice to parents and obtaining their consent as required by law. Google uses this information to target advertisements to children across the internet and across devices.� Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Ayanti Bera in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Steve Orlofsky",https://in.reuters.com/article/alphabet-ftc/google-to-pay-up-to-200-million-to-ftc-on-youtube-probe-source-idINKCN1VK285?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Ray alleged the makers have copied an artwork of contemporary artist Shilo Shiv Suleman and used it in their poster. Sharing the picture of the artwork and the film's poster, Ray wrote, ""This is NOT inspiration but blatant theft. In no world, is this acceptable.""",Times Now,"Lisa Ray has accused the makers of Saaho�of plagiarism. The actress took to Instagram on Friday to write a post, where she has alleged how the makers of Saaho�have copied an artwork of contemporary artist Shilo Shiv Suleman and used it in one of their posters.

Lisa shared the two pictures, one of the original artwork and the other of a similar image featuring Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor's photos on it.

Lisa wrote: ""�We need to stand up and speak up. To hold up a mirror to these makers to make them understand THIS IS NOT RIGHT. It's come to light that big-budget film production has ripped off one of Shilo's original creations. This is NOT inspiration but blatant theft. In no world, is this acceptable. The production did not contact the creator, asking her permission or offer to collaborate or offering a credit. Nothing. This is not right.""

The picture in question happens to be a poster of the song Baby won't You Tell Me,�featuring Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor. In the poster, the two actors can be seen walking hand in hand while the background looks very similar to the artwork shared by Lisa.

Taking a dig at the Hindi film industry, the ""Dobaara"" actress added, ""I believed the Hindi film industry was evolving necessarily past stealing storylines and so-called inspiration, but the producers of Shahoo have obviously not gotten the memo when it comes to art. Here's the thing. Creators are worthy of worship. What they produce are more lasting and precious so than all the other �things' that can be taken away. Let's hold these producers accountable for their infuriating, dishonourable action.""

Lisa ended the note with a question, ""How would you feel if a thief slid into your home and took away your most prized possessions? Your heart. Your soul. And your livelihood.""

The makers of Saaho�are yet to react to this.

Saaho,�helmed by Sujeeth has released in Hindi, Telugu, and Tamil in theatres across the country today. The action-thriller stars Prabhas, Shraddha Kapoor, Evelyn Sharma, Mandira Bedi, and Neil Nitin Mukesh.

3408,Iran goes further in breaching nuclear deal: UN nuclear watchdog,"Iran has gone further in breaching its nuclear deal with world powers, increasing its stock of enriched uranium and refining it to a greater purity than allowed, UN nuclear watchdog IAEA said in a report. IAEA also hinted at less than ideal cooperation from Iran. Iran has said it will breach the deal's limits one by one.",Reuters,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has gone further in breaching its nuclear deal with world powers, increasing its stock of enriched uranium and refining it to a greater purity than allowed, the U.N. atomic agency report said on Friday. The quarterly report from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is policing the 2015 deal, confirms Iran is progressively backing out of the deal in retaliation for  Washington�s withdrawal form the accord and renewal of sanctions that have hit Iranian oil sales. Iran has said it will breach the deal�s limits on its nuclear activities one by one, ratcheting up pressure on parties  who still hope to save it. U.S. President Donald Trump has offered to hold talks with Iran on a broader deal but Tehran says first it must get relief from U.S. sanctions. In July, the IAEA said Iran exceeded both a 202.8-kg limit on its enriched uranium stock and its 3.67% cap on the fissile purity to which it is allowed to refine uranium. In a verbal update on July 10, the IAEA said Iran was enriching uranium to 4.5% purity and had stockpiled 213.5 kg of enriched uranium. Friday�s quarterly report to member states obtained by Reuters said Iran has accumulated 241.6 kg of enriched uranium and is enriching at around the same level as before, up to 4.5%. Iran�s enriched uranium stock is still a fraction of the tonnes it possessed before the deal. Its enrichment level is also well short of the 20% it reached before the deal and the roughly 90% that is considered weapons-grade. Its breaches have therefore not yet made much difference to the time it would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb if it sought one. The deal - which set nuclear restrictions in exchange for sanctions relief - extended that time to roughly a year from a few months. Iran has threatened to take further steps by Sept. 6, such as enriching to 20% or restarting mothballed centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium. The report also hinted at less than ideal cooperation from Iran, saying: �Ongoing interactions between the Agency and Iran ... require full and timely cooperation by Iran. The Agency continues to pursue this objective with Iran.� A senior diplomat added, however, that Iran had not changed its level of cooperation and IAEA inspectors were able to visit all the locations in the country they needed to.

This comes after US State Secretary Mike Pompeo said, ""We recognised that North Korea's rogue behaviour could not be ignored."" Hui further said that Pompeo's remark has made the opening of the expected DPRK-US working-level negotiations more difficult.",Reuters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A recent remark by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about �North Korea�s rogue behavior� will make talks with the United States more difficult, the North�s KCNA news agency on Saturday quoted its vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, as saying.  �We recognized that North Korea�s rogue behavior could not be ignored,� Pompeo said on Tuesday, while speaking at the American Legion National Convention in the state of Indiana.  Pompeo�s comment was unreasonable and provocative, Choe said, according to the news agency. �Pompeo has gone so far in his language and it made the opening of the expected DPRK-U.S. working-level negotiations more difficult,� Choe said in statement.�  Choe also warned that North Korea�s expectations of talks with the United States are gradually disappearing and the country is being pushed to reexamine all measures.  �The U.S. had better not put our patience to the test any longer with such remarks irritating us if it doesn�t want to have bitter regrets afterwards,� Choe said.  North Korea has stepped up its criticism of Pompeo lately, calling him a �diehard toxin�, and casting doubt on attempts to restart talks In Washington, a State Department official indicated on Saturday that the United States remained interested in pursuing talks. �As we have indicated, we are prepared to engage in negotiations as soon as we hear from our counterparts in North Korea,� said the official, who asked not to be named. Negotiations aimed at dismantling the North�s nuclear and missile programs have stalled since a failed second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi in February. Trump and Kim met again in June at the inter-Korean border and agreed to reopen working-level negotiations, but that has not happened. Since the Vietnam summit, North Korea has demanded that Pompeo be replaced with a �more mature� person, while lauding the rapport built between Kim and Trump. North Korea has fired a series of short-range missiles in recent weeks in protest against U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises and the adoption of new weapons, complicating the reopening of the talks.

As the portrayal of the female character is changing in Bollywood films, asked about how she looks at the change, Shraddha told IANS here, ""I think whether it is in our entertainment business or in our society, the casual sexism is going away and it was bound to happen. It is wonderful to see how gender is not limiting a job profile, there are no such things as �men's job' anymore. All those notions that were previously practised are challenged now.""

Van Dijk is the first defender to win the award, beating Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus and Barcelona�s Lionel Messi who have won the award, established in 2010, five-times between them. The 28-year-old Netherands centre back has transformed Liverpool�s defence since joining them from Southampton in January, 2018 for a then world record fee of 75 million pounds ($92.08 million) for a defender with his physical presence and superb reading of the game. Van Dijk began his career in his homeland with Groningen and moved to Scottish club Celtic before heading to the Premier League, where he helped Liverpool to runners-up spot last season as well as a Champions League triumph over Tottenham Hotspur. �It�s been a long road but that�s part of my journey, it�s part of who I am. I needed it like this, I�m not a player who was 18 years old and had that rise straight away. I had to work hard for every step of the way - that�s part of me and I�m very happy about that,� said the Dutchman. �I�m very proud to get this trophy and it�s all credit to everyone that�s helped me along the way.�  Van Dijk had earlier picked up the Champions League Defender of the Season award.

Bronze, the former Manchester City attacking fullback, enjoyed a successful season, winning the Champions League with Lyon and reaching the World Cup semi-final with England. She finished ahead of club team mates Ada Hegerberg of Norway and Amandine Henry of France. �I�m ecstatic and super humbled to have won the award up against two fantastic players who I know really well at Lyon; two great girls, great players. �I want to say huge thanks to the Lionesses, the England team.

3425,"TN school kids made to hold posters with sexist, homophobic msgs",Children of a school in Chennai were made to hold posters having sexist and homophobic messages in a campaign organised by a former SBI employee R Mohan. Mohan said he has been organising such campaigns for 17 years. The school's assistant headmaster claimed she hadn't seen the posters before sending the students but said that she agrees with its content.,The News Minute,"It was a sight that brought 26-year-old Keerthana, who was on her morning walk on Friday, to a complete halt. Standing there, in white and green school uniforms at Karpagam Gardens in Chennai's Adyar, were female school students from Avvai Home Higher Secondary School with extremely offensive, sexist and homophobic posters in their hands.'Parents protect yourself & your children from Gays-Homos-Lesbians',�'Do not corrupt other minds by wearing provocative & revealing dresses',�'Women using dupatta meant for its purpose walk without any fear',�'Sexy dresses invites eve-teasing',�'Women's groups express support for bar girls. What a shame?!'These were the lines splashed across the blue and white charts that were held up by the unassuming students who were chatting and laughing on the public road.�""There were at least 50 female students, accompanied by 6-7 members of the school staff,"" said Keerthana, who works in a self-financed college. ""I immediately confronted the adults there and demanded to know what a 'sexy dress' was. A man, who was standing with them, said that it was when a woman showed her breasts in public. I was just horrified. How can they teach young girls that rape or sexual harassment is their fault?"" she asked.The man whom Keerthana confronted is R Mohan, a former employee of the State Bank of India, who along with serving and retired staff has been conducting these 'awareness' programmes for 17 years in Chennai. He is not associated with the school in any official capacity.When TNM contacted the school, the assistant headmaster, who refused to divulge her name, claimed that she had not seen the posters before sending her students to hold them up in a public place.""Our staff went with the girls for their safety but we had not seen what the posters said. The (ex) SBI staff R Mohan told us that it was regarding women's safety,"" she said. However, when probed about the content, she says that she agrees with it. Further, the senior teacher, who is in a position to influence young minds, says that limiting the freedom of girls and women as opposed to educating boys and men was the means to stop sexual harassment.""We (women) have to concentrate on our dresses,"" she added, when asked about the messages on women's attire.But doesn't that amount to blaming the victim for sexual harassment? Shouldn't men be the ones receiving moral education?""We (women) have to take the message positively. We have to take steps for safety when incidents like this happen. Gents are filled with lust,"" she argued, falling back on patriarchal ideas that have contributed towards building a culture where the onus of preventing sexual violence has been placed exclusively on women.Mohan, who organised the campaign, says that these posters have been held up across the city for the past 17 years. When TNM pointed out that his posters are homophobic and sexist, he countered this with more misogynistic statements.""No, it doesn't place the blame on women,"" he said, before resorting to the 'biology' argument. ""Biological urge for men and women are same. If a person wears clothes exposing their breasts or if it is transparent, this naturally.... It is a spur of moment action (sexual harassment or rape). The person is just..he searches for opportunity. And if he gets the opportunity, he does it,"" he said.To make matters worse, he claimed that women do not have the right to wear the clothing of their choice.""It is done by a handful of Westernised people who think they have the right to expose their body in public places and to kiss in public places. This is not Tamil culture,"" said Mohan. ""This will definitely lead to sexual harassment. The biological urge is spur of the moment. Not just young boys, even old people are not exceptions,"" he added, reducing men to mere animals with 'urges'.When asked about the homophobic content on his posters, he said, ""Children should be taught about gays and lesbians and warned about unwanted advances,"" he said.When TNM contacted M.P. Nirmala, the Chairperson of Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights (TNCPCR), she said that the school in the past has been averse to progressive awareness programmes.""Yes, children cannot be made to hold such posters and probably don't even know the contents,"" she said.

Sundaram said Amazon doesn't influence prices when Khandelwal asked what ""magic"" was used to offer discounts. When Sundaram said Amazon warehouses provide logistics support to small sellers, Khandelwal retorted, ""We are not small. Don't call us small, please"".",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com defended its business strategies in India as it came under fire from a local trader group on Friday over discounted products on the global e-commerce giant�s website. New e-commerce foreign investment rules that took effect in India from February were designed to help small traders by curbing heavy online discounting, but traders have complained that big online retailers use complex business structures to circumvent the rules and continue to burn billions of dollars to offer discounts. The issue has become one of the biggest trade irritants between New Delhi and Washington. At an open panel discussion on Friday - organised by India�s competition watchdog - the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) reiterated its concerns to Amazon�s senior corporate counsel, Rahul Sundaram, sparking a heated public confrontation. The CAIT represents 500,000 merchants and traders in India.  Sundaram said Amazon was abiding by all the rules and does not influence prices of products its website, adding that the company provides growth opportunities to more than 500,000 sellers online. The trade body, however, was in no mood to accept Sundaram�s statement. CAIT�s Praveen Khandelwal pointed out to Sundaram that an air conditioning unit available at 42,000 rupees in the offline retail market was sold for 35,000 rupees on Amazon�s website and asked what �magic� was used to offer such a discount. Sundaram hit back with a personal example, saying he had once spent half a day once walking around New Delhi markets to buy an air conditioner and managed to secure a discount of 6,000 rupees.  �It is a factor of the entire retail market that you will get discounts,� he said. The new rules introduced in February followed complaints from small traders who said that the e-commerce giants used their control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace.  In June the Indian government warned Amazon and Walmart�s Flipkart that they must ensure compliance with the new regulation, adding that it will not allow deep discounts that affect small shopkeepers. At one point during Friday�s discussion, Amazon�s Sundaram said the company�s 57 warehouses in India provide logistics support to small sellers and traders, which served only to rile Khandelwal further.     �We are not small ... Don�t call us small, please,� came the CAIT representative�s angry retort.

If you go out there and play well, you can easily turn things around.�Australia will welcome the return of Steve Smith who seems to have fully recovered after being diagnosed with concussion during the second Test. England are also gearing up for the return of veteran James Anderson who pulled out on the opening day of the first Test hurting his right calf.�Steve Smith coming back is a massive, massive bonus for Australia, but he has got his own demons to face in Jofra Archer and the short ball, especially on the quickest pitch on the circuit in Old Trafford.

Defending champions Liverpool and Napoli will meet in Group E, while PSG and Real Madrid were drawn together in Group A. Premier League champions Manchester City will face Shakhtar Donetsk, Dinamo Zagreb and Atalanta.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Holders Liverpool received a relatively kind draw for this season�s Champions League group stage but 13-times European champions Real Madrid were pitted against Kylian Mbappe and Paris St Germain. Juergen Klopp�s side, who beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in June�s final to win their sixth European Cup, will face Serie A�s Napoli, Austria�s Salzburg and Belgian side Genk. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane will return to his homeland France for a clash with PSG in Group A which also features Club Brugge and Galatasaray. The draw produced two fascinating groups which should deliver a real battle for qualification with Barcelona facing Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan and Slavia Prague in Group F. Group D is also a mouth-watering prospect with Italian champions Juventus taking on Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Lokomotiv Moscow. Last year�s runners-up Tottenham Hotspur face German champions Bayern Munich as well as Greek side Olympiakos and Serbia�s Red Star Belgrade in Group B. Liverpool played Napoli at the same stage last season, losing 1-0 in Naples before securing a place in the next round with Mohamed Salah scoring the only goal in the win at Anfield. �Napoli are obviously a very experienced side and their coach Carlo Ancelotti has won the competition,� said Klopp, referring to his triumphs with AC Milan and Real Madrid. �I will need now to have another, closer look at Genk and Salzburg, but I already know they are very young, very exciting and very fresh, so it will be interesting, 100 percent,� he said. Two of Liverpool�s squad, Sadio Mane and Naby Keita, have played for Salzburg, who are managed by American Jesse Marsch. Liverpool, beaten by Real Madrid in the 2018 final, are looking to becoming the first English team to reach three consecutive Champions League/European Cup finals. In the past two seasons, Liverpool have scored more goals and won more games than any other team in the competition. It remains to be seen if PSG�s Brazil forward Neymar, linked with Real and Barca, will be at the club when the Parisians take on Madrid. Real eliminated PSG in the last 16 in 2018. Dortmund captain Marco Reus, was delighted with the psopect of facing Barca. �A few of us from the team were stood together at breakfast this morning and we all agreed that we�d love to draw Barcelona,� he said.  �I am buzzing that it�s actually happened. Obviously, the group is extremely difficult. The games against Barcelona will have a party atmosphere for us and our fans. We believe in our quality and our aim is to go through,� he said. Chelsea have a tricky test in Group H where they face last season�s semi-finalists Ajax Amsterdam along with Spain�s Valencia and French club Lille. Premier League champions Manchester City will feel happy with their draw in Group C which puts them up against Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine, Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb and Italy�s Atalanta, who are in the group stage for the first time.

3439,New Instagram feature may allow users to import IGTV stories to FB,"Instagram has been working on a feature that would allow users to import Instagram Stories directly to the Facebook app. The feature, which is still in the prototype stage, can be used by toggling the ""make visible on Facebook"" switch. This move, if happens, could prompt more creators to use IGTV, which hasn't taken off as a standalone video platform.",TechCrunch,"Following the departure of Instagram�s founders, Facebook is working to more closely integrate the photo-sharing app with its flagship social network. It�s already added its brand name next to Instagram�s, and is working to make both platforms� messaging products interoperable. Now, Facebook is prototyping a means of syndicating Instagram�s IGTV video to Facebook�s  video site, Facebook Watch.In another find from noted reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong, Instagram was found to have under development a feature that would allow Instagram  users to post their IGTV content to both Instagram as a preview, as well as to Facebook and Watch � the latter by toggling an additional switch labeled �make visible on Facebook.�Instagram is working on IGTV Series pic.twitter.com/SLOWCnicLJ� Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) August 28, 2019Wong says the feature is still in the prototype stage, as the buttons themselves aren�t functional.This move, should it come to pass, could prompt more video creators to use IGTV, given that it would boost their videos� distribution by also including Facebook as a destination for their content. The videos could also be part of an ongoing, episodic series, Wong found.This, in turn, could help IGTV � an app which hasn�t quite taken off as a standalone video platform. Today, IGTV takes inspiration from TikTok and Snapchat�s vertical video. It�s meant to engage Instagram users with longer-form, portrait mode video content both within Instagram and in a separate IGTV app. But IGTV has often been filled with poorly cropped and imported web video, rather than content designed specifically for the platform.Meanwhile, the IGTV app has struggled to rise to the top of the App Store�s charts the way its parent, Instagram, has. Today, it�s ranked No. 159 in the Photo & Video category on the App Store, and unranked in the Overall top charts.To address some of the issues that creators have complained about, Instagram this week rolled out a few changes to the upload experience. This included the new ability to select the 1:1 crop of an IGTV thumbnail for the creator�s Profile Cover as well as the ability to edit which 5:4 section of the IGTV video shows in the Feed.IGTV will also now auto-populate Instagram handles and tags on IGTV titles and descriptions, and will now support the ability to upload longer video from mobile. With the latter change, IGTV has increased the minimum threshold to upload on mobile to one minute, and is allowing mobile uploads up to 15 minutes.Instagram declined to comment on the possible syndication of IGTV content to Facebook and Facebook Watch.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/instagram-may-allow-creators-to-syndicate-igtv-videos-to-facebook/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3469,Iranian tanker released by Gibraltar headed to Lebanon: Turkey,"Iranian oil tanker first detained and later released by British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar is headed towards Lebanon, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Friday. Crew of Adrian Darya 1 had reportedly set a course for Turkey according to data in its navigational system. Lebanese Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil denied knowledge of Iranian tanker heading towards them.",Reuters,"OSLO/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey said on Friday that an Iranian oil tanker at the center of a confrontation between Washington and Tehran was headed to Lebanon�s waters, but the United States later said the ship was sailing to Syria.  According to Refinitiv tracking data, the Adrian Darya, formerly called Grace 1, after changing course several times headed on Friday for Turkey�s Iskenderun port, 200 km (124 miles) north of Syria�s Baniyas refinery, the tanker�s suspected original destination. When the ship was released off Gibraltar in mid-August after a five-week standoff, Iran assured Britain that the cargo was not headed to Syria.  The latest twist sets it in the direction of Syria, and raises the possibility that a ship-to-ship transfer of cargo may be attempted once it nears Lebanon�s coast. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet late on Friday: �We have reliable information that the tanker is underway and headed to Tartus, Syria.� Pompeo had earlier said that if the tanker went to Syria, Washington would take every action it could consistent with U.S. sanctions.  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said earlier on Friday that despite the tracking data, the tanker was �for sure� not going to Turkish ports but rather toward Lebanese waters. Earlier on Friday, the minister told Reuters the ship was headed to Lebanon�s �main� port. �I didn�t mean that this tanker is going to a Lebanese port, but (rather) according to the information coordinates it is heading to the territorial waters of the country,� he later told reporters at an Oslo forum.  �It doesn�t mean that it is going to reach a Lebanese port,� he said of the tanker that was carrying 2 million barrels of oil when released at Gibraltar. �We are monitoring it very closely.� In response, Lebanese Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said in a separate interview: �We have not been informed of the Iranian oil tanker Adrian Darya heading (here).� The apparent confusion underlines the risk of reprisal that countries face taking in the tanker, which at 1400 GMT was headed east toward the channel separating Turkey and Cyprus after a series of turns in the Mediterranean Sea, according to tracking data. The ship had been detained off Gibraltar due to British suspicion that it was carrying Iranian oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.  The United States says the tanker is controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, which it considers a terrorist group. �What�s important here is that it is carrying oil that enables the terrorism of (President Bashar al-Assad�s) regime,� a State Department spokesperson said. The Trump administration has conveyed �our strong position via diplomatic channels to all ports in the Mediterranean that should be forewarned about facilitating� the tanker, said the spokesperson, who declined to be named.   The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday blacklisted the ship and sanctioned its captain. Washington last year pulled out of a nuclear deal with Iran aimed at blocking its path to a nuclear bomb, and has ramped up sanctions to pressure and isolate Tehran. Iran denies ever having sought to build or acquire a nuclear weapon. Cavusoglu told Reuters that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke about the ship�s coordinates with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday. In a readout of the call, London said the leaders agreed it was vital to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon but did not mention the tanker. Shipping sources said the tanker would need to conduct a ship-to-ship transfer before being able to enter a port such as Beirut�s, which does not have deep water facilities necessary for fully laden supertankers.  It could potentially discharge its cargo offshore toward Lebanon�s Tripoli port further north, which is closer to Syria�s coastline between Lebanon and Turkey, they said. There is a ship-to-ship transfer anchorage outside of Tripoli port limits. Beirut and Tripoli ports have both served as transhipment hubs for cargoes bound for Syria in recent years during Syria�s conflict.  An Iranian government spokesman was quoted on Monday as saying Iran had sold the oil aboard the tanker and that the vessel�s owner, whose identity he did not disclose, would decide its destination.  After its release at Gibraltar, the ship stated that its destination was the Greek port of Kalamata, then Turkey�s Mersin. On Thursday, it abruptly changed course, heading first west then south, away from the Turkish coast. While west of Cyprus on Friday morning, it did a similar maneuver, doubling back on itself.

He fell down from the theatre building after he was electrocuted. The boy was a daily wage labourer and is survived by his mother.,The News Minute,"A 16-year-old Prabhas fan was electrocuted on Thursday when he came in contact with an electric wire while trying to erect the banner of his star at a theatre in Mahabubnagar, Telangana.The 16-year-old identified as Venkatesh, a resident of Boyapalli Thanda in Mahabubnagar, was trying to fix the banner of Saaho -- Prabhas� film which is releasing on Friday -- from the window pane of the theatre building. However, as an electric pole was too close to the building, Venkatesh accidentally came in contact with the electric wire. As soon as he came in contact with the high-tension wire, he got electrocuted, and fell down from the building.�Police said that Venkatesh was a daily-wage labourer. Immediately after the accident, his friends had taken Venkatesh to a nearby hospital. However, as his condition was critical, he was shifted to the state-run Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad. His cousin Rajesh told TNM that Venkatesh was critical and the doctors may amputate his arm.After the management of Tirumala theatre informed the police about the accident. A case was registered in this regard, according to Deccan Chronicle.�Saaho�is one of the biggest films of actor Prabhas. The film was made on a whopping budget of Rs 350 crore, and it is releasing in around 10,000 screens in India alone. In the Telugu states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the film will be released in more than 2,000 screens.�Saaho�was made in four languages -- Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam and Tamil.�And as for any other big budget movie starring a superstar, fan clubs and fan associations have gone into a tizzy this time too. Though, there has been much debate against unsafe things that fans indulge in, during the release of a movie, they continue to do so. This is also not the first time that a fan has lost his life trying to put up a banner. Stories of fans dying while putting up banners and these giant banners in turn posing a danger to the public have been reported multiple times from Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for instance.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/prabhas-fan-electrocuted-while-putting-saaho-banner-telangana-108069?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Rayudu, 33, was not picked in India�s squad for the 50-over World Cup in England after being tipped as the team�s top choice for a middle-order batting spot. He was not considered as a replacement even when India lost opener Shikhar Dhawan and Vijay Shankar to injuries, with Rishabh Pant and Mayank Agarwal called up instead, despite being named as one of the five stand-bys for the tournament. A smarting Rayudu, who quit first-class cricket in 2018 to focus on his limited-overs career, announced last month he has retired from all forms of the game.  He has now informed the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) of his availability. �He has withdrawn his retirement letter that he gave and said he�s available to play for HCA,� Ratnakar Shetty, a member of the committee in charge of the HCA administration, said. Rayudu will be available to play the full season for Hyderabad and it was a �good� news for the team, Shetty added. The middle-order batsman has played 55 one-day internationals for India, the last of them in March against Australia, and was part of the Chennai Super Kings franchise in the 2019 Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament. �It is great news for us. I still believe he still has five years of cricket and groom youngsters which is more important for us. Last year without him, we struggled in Ranji Trophy,� HCA chief selector Noel David told Sportstar. �Rayudu�s class and experience will prove to be very handy for Hyderabad and will surely have a major positive influence on the other players as he will be playing in all the formats. �Hopefully he carries on the good work and leads from the front and I am confident of Rayudu getting support from all quarters.� Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Amlan Chakraborty",https://in.reuters.com/article/cricket-india-rayudu/cricket-india-batsman-rayudu-does-retirement-u-turn-idINKCN1VK0FH?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3480,"Death toll from Ebola outbreak in Congo climbs above 2,000","The death toll from the Democratic Republic of Congo's year-long Ebola outbreak has climbed above 2,000, according to government data. The government team overseeing the response said the number of confirmed and probable cases stood at more than 3,000. ""We are fighting literally (along) with all partners on the ground...to identify cases as early as possible,"" World Health Organisation said.",Reuters,"GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - The death toll from Democratic Republic of Congo�s year-long Ebola outbreak has climbed above 2,000, government data showed on Friday, as responders battle to overcome community mistrust and widespread security problems. The death in neighboring Uganda of a 9-year-old girl who had tested positive for the virus after entering the country from Congo underscored the challenge medical teams face containing the disease in border territory with a highly mobile population. The government team overseeing the response said the number of confirmed and probable cases had also hit a milestone of more than 3,000 in what has become the second-worst epidemic of the virus on record. Despite the development of an effective vaccine and treatments, health workers have struggled to stop the virus spreading in remote and conflict-hit areas of eastern Congo, where many locals are wary of the response effort. Nevertheless, the World Health Organization said the latest Uganda case highlighted the border authorities� skill at detecting and isolating potential sources of transmission. �This case was picked up at the border,� WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said at a briefing in Geneva. �The people who are at the borders have the expertise.� This is Congo�s 10th Ebola outbreak, but it is the first in the densely forested hillside provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, where militia-led violence and ethnic killing have undermined security in certain areas for decades. The WHO declared the epidemic an international health emergency in July - only the fifth outbreak to warrant this status since the system was introduced in 2005. The authorities have since come up against new fronts in their fight to contain the virus, testing the reach and flexibility of responders. Health workers confirmed the first cases in South Kivu province on Aug. 16. Soon after, a woman contracted the virus in a remote, militia-controlled territory in North Kivu, hundreds of kilometers away from other known cases. �The response is being spread too thin chasing new cases at the expense of the longer-term community engagement that is crucial if we�re ever to hope of being Ebola free,� Oxfam�s Congo Director Corinne N�Daw said in a statement. Despite the virus spreading to new areas, the past week�s transmission rate was little changed from that of the past month and a half, which has seen an average of 77 new cases per week, according to the WHO. Last week the WHO voiced concern about the widening geographic reach of the disease, but confirmed the virus had not gained a foothold in the major city of Goma, even after four cases were recorded there in July and early August. Goma, a lakeside city of nearly 2 million people on the Rwandan border, had been on high alert for weeks after a gold miner with a large family infected several people with Ebola before dying himself. The latest government data showed Ebola deaths reaching 2,006 and cases at 3,004. �Two thousand deaths means that there is a problem,� said Timoth�e Buliga, a priest, returning home from his church in Goma. �We need to reach the point where we reject Ebola, say no and eradicate it definitively.� Only the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been deadlier than the current outbreak. More than 11,300 people died then out of the 28,000 who were infected.

3481,Brazil bans land-clearing fires in Amazon forest for 60 days,Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro issued a decree banning land-clearing forest fires in the Amazon rainforest for 60 days. The move comes as wildfires in the Amazon have been raging at a record rate. The period of the ban comes in the dry season when most fires are usually set by farmers who clear the land for new crops.,Times Now,"Brasilia: Brazil on Thursday banned setting fires to clear land for 60 days in response to a massive increase in the number of fires in the Amazon rainforest. The decree incorporating the ban was signed by President Jair Bolsonaro, who has faced intense criticism at home and abroad for failing to protect the rainforest.�It remains unclear what impact the ban will have as according to environmentalists, the overwhelming majority of forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon is already illegal and enforcement is lax, the BBC reported.The Forestry Code only permits fires in specific cases and when authorized by an environmental entity. In the case of indigenous peoples, the practice is allowed in subsistence farming. This comes as a leading Brazilian environmentalist warned on Wednesday that the ""worst of the fire is yet to come"".About 80,000 blazes have been detected in Brazil this year - more than half in the Amazon region - although on Saturday, Bolsonaro claimed the situation was ""returning to normal"".""The worst of the fire is still to come,"" Tasso Azevedo, a forest engineer and environmentalist who coordinates the deforestation monitoring group MapBiomas, wrote in an article for Brazil's O Globo newspaper.�Azevedo said many of the areas currently being consumed by flames were stretches of Amazon rainforest that had been torn down in the months of April, May and June. But areas deforested in July and August - when government monitoring systems detected a major surge in destruction - were yet to be torched.Azevedo called for a ban on the use of fire in the Amazon region until the end of the dry season in November.
He also called for urgent action to end deforestation, which he said was largely illegal and linked to criminal groups involved in timber theft, gold mining and land grabbing.The Brazilian Amazon lost 1,114.8 sq km - an area equivalent to Hong Kong - in the first 26 days of August, according to preliminary data from the government's satellite monitoring agency. An area half the size of Philadelphia was reportedly lost in July, reports say.�South American countries will meet next week to discuss the crisis. Bolsonaro has accepted Chile's offer of four planes to fight the fires, but he has refused a G7 offer of $22 million following a spat with French President Emmanuel Macron.The government says it has deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states to combat the fires. That came after Bolsonaro last week said the authorities did not have the resources to fight the blazes.

The reports have to be uploaded on the company's websites by September 30. The new FDI norms came into effect from February 1.,Entrackr,"The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) has asked e-commerce marketplaces such as Amazon and Flipkart to upload statutory audit reports certifying FDI compliance on their websites.The compliance reports have to be uploaded within a month time (by Sept 30), which as per ET report will cover Feb-March 2019 period. DIIPT Secretary Guruprasad Mohapatra, in a meet, communicated the decision to e-comm marketplaces.In December last year, the govt issued�Press Note 2�and asked FDI compliance certification be submitted to the Reserve Bank of India (India) whereas FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) notification a month after did not mandate the requirement.Govt had later asked RBI to include the provision in the FEMA notification.Two months ago, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had asked e-comm firms to comply with the FDI norms and submit audit reports.The govt had also asked e-commerce firms to submit details of their shareholding, subsidiaries and business structures, among others. However, they did not comply.Earlier, SMEs and small sellers had complained to the govt that e-commerce marketplaces are flouting regulation norms and offering deep discounts to lure consumers. The govt after mulling for long came out with new FDI regulation.In last December, the govt had modified�FDI�rules for its booming e-commerce sector.The FDI draft policy, which was�implemented in February�barred e-tailers from selling products via vendors in which they have equity, and from allowing sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms. It also prohibits vendors from buying more than 25% from group companies of online platforms.In case that single vendor is selling more than 25%, then that will be considered as maintaining an inventory, which is against the FDI laws of the B2C consumer market.Besides, the marketplaces are not allowed to influence prices directly or indirectly and have to offer a level-playing field all vendors. As per the draft norms, marketplaces cannot mandate any seller to sell any product exclusively on the marketplace.",https://entrackr.com/2019/08/dpiit-asks-amazon-flipkart-upload-fdi-compliance/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3486,Google finds malicious websites which hacked iPhones for years,"Security researchers at Google have found several hacked websites that targeted iPhones over a period of at least two years to 'implant' malicious software to access photos, locations, passwords etc. The researchers said on Thursday that the websites were visited a thousand times a week by users. Most of the vulnerabilities targeted were found in iPhone's default Safari web browser.",TechCrunch,"Security researchers at Google say they�ve found a number of malicious websites which, when visited, could quietly hack into a victim�s iPhone by exploiting a set of previously undisclosed software flaws.Google�s Project Zero said in a deep-dive blog post published late on Thursday that the websites were visited thousands of times per week by unsuspecting victims, in what they described as an �indiscriminate� attack.�Simply visiting the hacked site was enough for the exploit server to attack your device, and if it was successful, install a monitoring implant,� said Ian Beer, a security researcher at Project Zero.He said the websites had been hacking iPhones over a �period of at least two years.�The researchers found five distinct exploit chains involving 12 separate security flaws, including seven involving Safari, the in-built web browser on iPhones. The five separate attack chains allowed an attacker to gain �root� access to the device � the highest level of access and privilege on an iPhone.

Reportedly, the area where the meeting took place was heavily guarded and no media personnel was allowed to go near it. This was the first such meeting after India revoked Article 370 in J&K.",The New Indian Express,"ISLAMABAD/GURDASPUR: India has reportedly told Pakistan to fast-track the process of constructing the 300-metre long bridge on the river Ravi on its side which will connect the Kartarpur corridor on the zero line between both the countries.India has already completed 70 per cent of work of the 100 metres of the same bridge being constructed on its side.�Sources said that the fourth round of technical talks about the corridor between both countries took place on Friday on the zero line at Dera Baba Nanak. Fifteen officials from each side participated in the meeting.The bridge has been a bone of contention between the two countries. Initially, Pakistan was not willing to construct the bridge as it insisted that it would instead build a causeway.Indian officials, though, said the causeway would lead to flooding in the area. An agreement was reached and construction of the bridge was approved.�ALSO READ |�Construction work on Kartarpur Corridor resumesThe Indian delegation comprised of HK Wadhwa and Alok Kumar from the Ministry of Home Affairs; Yash Pal Singh Jadon, Project Director, National Highway Authority of India; Akhil Saxena, Member (Planning and Development), Land Port Authority of India; Jeetendra Singh, Vice-President of Ceigall India construction company; and Mahipal Yadav, IGP, BSF (Punjab Frontier).�This was the first meeting on the Kartarpur corridor after the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and will probably be the last one before the first batch of Sikh pilgrims from India pass through the corridor on November 8 to attend the 550 birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak.�Over the past few months, many rounds of meetings have been held on the corridor during which the experts from the two sides have discussed its alignment, coordinates and other engineering aspects of the proposed crossing points.The corridor will be the first visa-free corridor between the two neighbours since their independence in 1947.Terrorist arrestedHarpal Singh Pala, a close aid of pro-Khalistan leader and former secretary of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee Gopal Singh Chawla, was arrested by Punjab Police three days ago for spying from Bhatija village of Kartarpur region.

3502,Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong arrested ahead of protests,"Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was arrested on Friday ahead of the planned weekend protests, Wong's political party said. Two other activists, Andy Chan and Agnes Chow, have also been detained. Police said Wong and Chow were arrested on suspicion of ""organising unauthorised assembly"" and ""knowingly participating in unauthorised assembly"".",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested a number of prominent pro-democracy activists including Joshua Wong and three lawmakers on Friday, seeking to rein in protests that have plunged the city into its worst political crisis for decades.  Wong, who was one of the leaders of the pro-democracy �Umbrella� movement five years ago, is the most prominent activist to be arrested since protests escalated in mid-June over fears China is exerting greater control over the city and squeezing its freedoms.  He was charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly outside police headquarters on June 21.  Police also arrested Agnes Chow, another senior member of his group Demosisto.  Other activists arrested included Athea Suen, a former university student union leader, as well as three pro-democracy lawmakers - Cheng Chung-tai, Au Nok-hin and Jeremy Tam.  Au and Tam had been present at some protests and faced charges including obstructing police officers, according to their political parties.    Police also blocked plans for a mass demonstration on Saturday in a show of force a day before the fifth anniversary of a decision by China to curtail democratic reforms in the former British colony. The bespectacled Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the student-led civil disobedience movement in 2014 that blocked major roads for 79 days, has not been a prominent figure in the latest protests, which have no identifiable leaders. He was released from jail in June after serving a five-week term for contempt of court.     Wong and Chow were released on bail and the case was adjourned until Nov. 8, but they will be subject to travel restrictions and a night-time curfew. �Under the chilling effects generated by Beijing and Hong Kong governments, we are strongly aware how they arrest activists no matter whether they behave progressively or moderately,� Wong told reporters. �All we ask for is just to urge Beijing and Hong Kong governments to withdraw the bill, stop police brutality and respond to our calls for a free election.� Thousands of demonstrators blockaded police headquarters on June 21 protesting against a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. More than three months of unrest has evolved into calls for greater democracy under the �one country, two systems� formula, by which Hong Kong has been ruled since the handover from British rule in 1997. The formula guaranteed freedoms not enjoyed on mainland China. Protesters accuse China of interference that they say has  steadily eroded Hong Kong�s freedoms and autonomy.  China denies the accusation. It has denounced the protests and warned of the damage to the economy of Hong Kong, a major financial center. It has also accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the demonstrations and warned against foreign interference. Andy Chan, a founder of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party that was banned last September, was arrested at Hong Kong airport on Thursday on suspicion of participating in riots and attacking police, police said. Wong�s pro-democracy group, Demosisto, said the arrests were an attempt to scapegoat individuals in a movement that has built momentum without public figureheads. �The arrests were apparently a political operation,� Demosisto said on its Facebook page. �It will only make the government misjudge the public, leading to a deadly situation that is more difficult to resolve.� The Civil Human Rights Front, the organizer of previous protests, canceled a mass demonstration planned for Saturday after the police refused permission.  Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Chief Executive Carrie Lam previously requested Beijing�s approval for a plan to ease tension, evidence of the extent to which China is controlling the Hong Kong government�s response to the unrest. Nearly 900 people have been arrested since the demonstrations began. There have been frequent clashes between protesters and police, who have often used fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, amid accusations of excessive force. With protesters and authorities locked in an impasse and Hong Kong facing its first recession in a decade, speculation has grown that the city government may impose emergency law, giving it extra powers over detentions, censorship and curfews. Hong Kong�s July retail sales sank the most since February 2016, government data showed on Friday. The government would consider using �all laws� to prevent violence, Hong Kong leader Lam, who has become a lightning rod for protesters� anger, said this week.  Hong Kong was a long way from having to make use of emergency powers, a senior official of China�s parliament told Reuters on Friday. China brought fresh troops into Hong Kong on Thursday in what it said was a routine rotation of its garrison.

""What we talk about is completely legal [and] transparent, and there's nothing that could be used against us,"" he said. Obrador had even claimed during his presidential campaign that he and his family were spied upon.",Reuters,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday unseen forces were spying on him and his cabinet, revealing that a �sophisticated camera� had been discovered at the presidential offices in central Mexico City. During a regular daily news briefing, in which he usually expounds on everything from history and economics to culture, Lopez Obrador said the device had been found in a room used for meetings in the National Palace, his headquarters. �Just imagine, they�ve been recording us in a meeting room, here in the Palace,� the president said as he reflected on the importance of free speech and transparency. Lopez Obrador, who didn�t provide details on the camera or how it came to be there, said he had no secrets. �What we talk about is completely legal, transparent, and there�s nothing that could be used against us,� he said. During the presidential campaign last year, Lopez Obrador said he and his family were the victims of spying. Upon taking office in December, he put an end to the former national intelligence agency CISEN, giving the body a new name. Lopez Obrador has accused previous governments of lacking transparency and suppressing dissent. He frequently blames negative reports about his administration on efforts by unnamed �adversaries� and �conservatives� to thwart his agenda. The administration of his predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto, faced persistent criticism over alleged surveillance by the state, and numerous reports were published of journalists, NGO workers and opposition politicians being snooped upon.

3506,Ex-FBI Director not to be prosecuted despite leaking Trump info,The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has decided not to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey despite an internal investigation that found he improperly leaked information to the news media. DOJ said leaked information did not contain classified material. Comey leaked the information to pressure the DOJ to launch an independent investigation into his conversations with President Donald Trump.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has decided not to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey despite an internal investigation that found he improperly leaked information to the news media, the department�s internal watchdog said on Thursday. The Justice Department�s Office of Inspector General said Comey asked a friend to share the contents of a memo with the New York Times to pressure the department to launch an independent investigation into his conversations with President Donald Trump. In the memo, Comey described a meeting in which Trump allegedly asked him to drop the FBI�s investigation into Michael Flynn, who at the time was his national security adviser. Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian officials. Comey signed off on an investigation into the Trump campaign�s possible ties to Russia during the 2016 election and later emerged as a prominent critic of the president after Trump fired him in May 2017. Trump and many of his allies say that investigation should never have begun. The Justice Department appointed a special counsel, Robert Mueller, to handle the investigation after Comey left. That probe unearthed numerous contacts between the campaign and Russian officials but concluded that there was not enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy. Mueller�s final report did not reach a conclusion as to whether Trump�s efforts to interfere with the probe amounted to criminal obstruction of justice, but it also did not exonerate the president. Attorney General William Barr concluded that he did not see enough evidence to bring obstruction charges. The Inspector General said on Thursday that while Comey�s memo did not contain classified material, he set a dangerous example when he shared sensitive information to create public pressure for official action.  �Were current or former FBI employees to follow the former Director�s example and disclose sensitive information in service of their own strongly held personal convictions, the FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly,� the report said. Comey said on Twitter that people who have accused him of sharing classified information should apologize. �To all those who�ve spent two years talking about me �going to jail� or being a �liar and a leaker��ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president,� he said. It is the second time Comey has been criticized by the Inspector General�s office, which concluded last year that he made a �serious error of judgment� when he announced shortly before the 2016 election that he was re-opening an investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton�s use of a private e-mail server when she was secretary of State. Trump said on Thursday: �Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General�s Report. He should be ashamed of himself!� White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham called Comey a �liar and a leaker� and said his decision to share information with the press led to a �baseless, politically motivated, two-year witch hunt.� Comey wrote seven memos during the first few months of Trump�s presidency, detailing one-on-one meetings in which Comey says Trump demanded loyalty and tried to influence the actions of the FBI, which is supposed to enforce the law in an impartial manner.  The Inspector General�s report said Comey should not have held on to the memos after he was fired because they were official FBI documents. Comey gave one of them to his friend Dan Richman and told him to share it with a New York Times reporter, according to the report. Richman declined to comment. Congress made redacted versions of those memos public last year. FBI spokesman Brian Hale said the report underscored the need for all agency employees, regardless of position, to obey rules about official records. The Justice Department declined to comment. Some Republicans said the Inspector General�s report provides more evidence that the FBI was motivated by political considerations when it started investigating the Trump campaign�s contacts with Russia. �This is the first of what I expect will be several more ugly and damning rebukes of senior DOJ and FBI officials regarding their actions and biases toward the Trump campaign of 2016,� Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said in a statement. The Inspector General�s office is currently examining the FBI�s conduct during the investigation, and Barr is also overseeing two inquiries into the origins of the Mueller probe: one led by John Durham, the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut, and another involving senior intelligence officials. Although the Justice Department will not prosecute Comey, he could face other disciplinary action because the Inspector General�s report has been referred to the FBI and the department�s Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigates employee misconduct. Democrats in Congress are split as to whether Trump should be impeached for the actions detailed in Mueller�s report, while    Republicans have largely stood by the president.

He took a dig at the former Pakistan cricketer stating that he refuses to mature after so many years and also went on to say that he is ordering the online kindergarten for Afridi.Shahid Afridi was bound to respond to Gautam Gambhir and he did so almost within 24 hours. The banter continued as the 39-year-old wittily mentioned that weather in Karachi is changing slowly and it is expected to rain and recalled India�s former Mental Conditioning Coach Paddy Upton�s comment on Gambhir.He had once said that the left-hander who opened for India was one of the weakest and mentally insecure players. �Gautam Gambhir was one of the weakest and mentally most insecure people I have worked with,� Paddy had said. Afridi pointed out at the same and also indirectly went on to say Gambhir speaks irrelevant things.�Change of weather in Karachi, rain in the air. Also each time Gautam tries to make himself relevant, I am reminded of this�,� Afridi wrote in his tweet.",https://www.crictracker.com/shahid-afridi-responds-to-gautam-gambhirs-kindergarten-comment/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

A new Watch model is also expected.",Times Now,"Apple has confirmed the date for its biggest event of the year 2019 - the launch of the iPhone 11 series. The Cupertino giant has just confirmed that they will be holding a keynote event on Tuesday, September 10 - the date of the iPhone 11 launch.The iPhone launch event is usually one of the biggest launch events of the year. The upcoming Apple Keynote will reportedly see the launch of three new iPhones - the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and an Apple Watch as well. There are some reports which have talked about the upcoming Watch and that it will be a newly finished Series 4. The same has been revealed in the upcoming iPhone software codes as well.Historically speaking, Apple always goes for a Wednesday launch to a Tuesday. But has always been careful at avoiding the September 11 data so as to avoid clashing with the memorial events taking place on that day.The Apple keynote will begin at 10 AM PST which is 10.30 PM in India.Recently, the new camera module design of the iPhone was leaked and the design sure is polarising but a number of reports have pointed out that the new iPhone 11 series will be getting massive camera upgrades - yes, even the iPhone 11R.The iPhone 11 is expected to carry a lot of upgrades in terms of camera modules, and the notch which is already two years old now, and the display. But design-wise, the iPhone 11 has been leaked a number of times and has been shown with a squared camera module which we think is now almost close to being confirmed to arrive on the upcoming iPhone.Expanding on other leaks, a new hands-on video of dummy iPhone units has also surfaced on YouTube which points at major design details alongside the triple camera setup placement of the iPhone 11 Pro. Keeping up with the new design claims in the video which has surfaced, new case renders have also now leaked on a case-selling website as well.�The new hands-on video of dummy models of the iPhone 11 series have been outed by ConceptsiPhone - videos of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro ahead of their official debut which takes place in the first half of September. The video shows dummy models of the two iPhones. The two models sport a wide notch up front, metal frames, glass back, and the Apple logo placed in the centre of the rear panel. In cameras, the iPhone 11 is seen to feature a dual rear camera setup, while the iPhone 11 Pro features a triple rear camera at the back inside a square-shaped protective module.�",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/apple-s-september-10-event-announced-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-and-iphone-11-pro-max-expected/478863?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The apex court will take up the matter on Friday.The plea relates to the case of a law student from SS Law College in Shahjahanpur in UP who went missing after an alleged sexual harassment by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand.Chinmayanand was booked in the case of alleged abduction of the law student on Tuesday, following which he claimed that it was an attempt to malign his image, similar to that of UP BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.On Wednesday, the BJP leader had told media that the young woman, who studied at the college of whose managing committee he was the president, was also part of the conspiracy started by four women lawyers.The 23-year-old woman has allegedly been missing from�her college hostel since Saturday, days after she accused Chinmayanand of harassment and �destroying the lives of several girls�.In a video that surfaced on the internet, the law student had sought the help of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, claiming that the former BJP MP was threatening to eliminate her and her family as she had evidence that could land him in trouble.The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh had tried to withdraw a 2011 rape and abduction case against Chinmayanand last year, but a court in Shahjahanpur had rejected its petition. The FIR against him was lodged on the complaint of a girl who had spent several years at his ashram. However, the BJP leader was never taken into custody.Chinmayanand had been a three-time BJP MP.

The innings comes just after a month after he led England to a nerve-shredding victory in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 final.Stokes celebrated his exploits by getting into a cab with few of his England teammates and feasting on McDonald�s. But for Stokes the epic comeback will get sweeter only if England end up lifting the Ashes at the Kensington Oval, the venue for fifth and final Test of the five-match series.�We have got ourselves back into the series by winning at Headingley. That day will only be made better for everyone � not just the team but all the staff who travel around with us � come the end of The Oval Test match when we are lifting the urn,� Stokes told talkSPORT. �It was an amazing thing to be able to get back in the series with such an amazing game that was basically a spectacle, but that will only be made sweeter if we lift the Ashes at the end because we�ve given ourselves a massive chance now.�Stokes revealed how he planned the run-chase once England had lost their nine wickets and still 73 runs behind the target.

Stokes was busy at one end, keeping his team in the contest but the task seemed insurmountable as wickets kept tumbling at the other.�Going in to bat in the morning with Joe, Australia started off the day brilliantly � I think they had four maidens in a row � and you have to respect good bowling when it comes.

We all saw what he did at Lords� when he got 92 and you have to be able to hold the bat to do that no matter who the opposition is.��I was always telling him to be on your bat in case we get two. I was telling him, right I�m going for two this ball or we are getting one on this ball. I was letting him know what my plan was. The first three balls I was really looking to attack.

3563,UK activists to fly drones at Heathrow airport to ground flights,"Environmental campaigners in the UK are planning to fly drones around Heathrow next month in an attempt to ground flights. The planned action is in protest at the government's decision to give green-light to a third runway at Heathrow. They will operate small toy drones on September 13 and expect up to ""a couple of hundred people"" to be involved.",TechCrunch,"A UK group of climate activists is planning to fly drones close to Heathrow Airport next month in a direct action they hope will shut down the country�s largest airport for days or even longer.The planned action is in protest at the government�s decision to green-light a third runway at Heathrow.They plan to use small, lightweight �toy� drones, flown at head high (6ft) within a 5km drone �no fly� zone around the airport � but not within flight paths. The illegal drone flights will also be made in the early morning at a time when there would not be any scheduled flights in the air space to avoid any risk of posing a threat to aircraft.The activists point out that the government recently declared a climate emergency � when it also pledged to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 � arguing there is no chance of meeting that target if the UK expands current airport capacity.A press spokesman for the group, which is calling itself Heathrow Pause, told TechCrunch: �Over a thousand child are dying as a result of climate change and ecological collapse � already, every single day. That figure is set to significantly worsen. The government has committed to not just reducing carbon emissions but reducing them to net zero � that is clearly empirically impossible if they build another runway.�The type of drones they plan to use for the protest are budget models which they say can be bought cheaply at UK retailer Argos � which, for example, sells the Sky Viper Stunt Drone for �30; the Revell GO! Stunt Quadcopter Drone for �40; and the Revell Spot 2.0 Quadcopter (which comes with a HD camera) for �50.The aim for the protest is to exploit what the group dubs a loophole in Heathrow�s health and safety protocol around nearby drone flights to force it to close down runways and ground flights.Late last year a spate of drone sightings near the UK�s second busiest airport, Gatwick, led to massive disruption for travellers just before Christmas after the airport responded by grounding flights.At the time, the government was sharply criticized for having failed to foresee weaknesses in the regulatory framework around drone flights near sensitive sites like airports.In the following months it responded by beefing up what was then a 1km airport exclusion zone to 5km � with that expanded �no fly� zone coming into force in March. However a wider government plan to table a comprehensive drones bill has faced a number of delays.It�s the larger 5km �no fly� zone that the Heathrow Pause activists are targeting in a way they hope will safely trigger the airport�s health & safety protocol and shut down the airspace and business as usual.Whether the strategy to use drones as a protest tool to force the closure of the UK�s largest airport will fly remains to be seen.A spokeswoman for Heathrow airport told us it�s confident it has �robust plans� in place to ensure the group�s protest does not result in any disruption to flights. However she would not provide any details on the steps it will take to avoid having to close runways and ground flights, per its safety protocol.When we put the airport�s claim of zero disruption from intended action back to Heathrow Pause, its spokesman told us: �Our understanding is that the airport�s own health and safety protocols dictate that they have to ground airplanes if there are any drones of any size flying at any height anywhere within 5km of the airport.�Our position would be that it�s entirely up to them what they do. That the action that we�re taking does not pose a threat to anybody and that�s very deliberately the case. Having said that I�d be surprised to hear that they�re going to disregard their own protocols even if those are � in our view � excessive. It would still come as a surprise if they weren�t going to follow them.��We won�t be grounding any flights in any circumstances,� he added. �It�s not within our power to do so. All of the actions that have been planned have been meticulously planned so as not to pose any threat to anybody. We don�t actually see that there need to be flights grounded either. Having said that clearly it would be great if Heathrow decided to ground flights. Every flight that�s grounded is that much less greenhouse gas pumped into the atmosphere. And it directly saves lives.�The fewer flights there are the better. But if there are no flights cancelled we�d still consider the action to be an enormous success � purely upon the basis of people being arrested.�The current plan for the protest is to start illegally flying drones near Heathrow on September 13 � and continue for what the spokesman said could be as long as �weeks�, depending on how many volunteer pilots it can sign up. He says they �anticipate� having between 50 to 200 people willing to risk arrest by breaching drone flight law.The intention is to keep flying drones for as long as people are willing to join the protest. �We are hoping to go for over a week,� he told us.Given the plan has been directly communicated to police the spokesman conceded there is a possibility that the activists could face arrest before they are able to carry out the protest � which he suggested might be what Heathrow is banking on.Anyone who flies a drone in an airport�s �no fly� zone is certainly risking arrest and prosecution under UK law. Penalties for the offence range from fines to life imprisonment if a drone is intentionally used to cause violence. But the group is clearly taking pains to avoid accusations the protest poses a safety risk or threatens violence � including by publishing extensive details of their plan online, as well as communicating it to police and airport authorities.A detailed protocol on their�website sets out the various safety measures and conditions the activists are attaching to the drone action � �to ensure no living being is harmed�. Such as only using drones lighter than 7kg, and giving the airport an hour�s advance notice ahead of each drone flight.They also say they have a protocol to shut down the protest in the event of an emergency � and will have a dedicated line of communication open to Heathrow for this purposes.Some of the activists are scheduled to meet with police and airport authorities� tomorrow, face to face, at a London police station to discuss the planned action.The group says it will only call off the action if the Heathrow third runway expansion is cancelled.In an emailed statement in response to the protest, Heathrow Airport told us:We agree with the need to act on climate change. This is a global issue that requires constructive engagement and action. Committing criminal offences and disrupting passengers is counterproductive.Flying of any form of drone near Heathrow is illegal and any persons found doing so will be subject to the full force of the law. We are working closely with the Met Police and will use our own drone detection capability to mitigate the operational impact of any illegal use of drones near the airport.Asked why the environmental activists have selected drones as their tool of choice for this protest, rather than deploying more traditional peaceful direct action strategies, such as trespassing on airport grounds or chaining themselves to fixed infrastructure, the Heathrow Pause spokesman told us: �Those kind of actions have been done in the past and they tend to result in very short duration of time during which very few flights are cancelled. What we are seeking to do is unprecedented in terms of the duration and the extent of the disruption that we would hope to cause.�The reason for drones is in order to exploit this loophole in the health and safety protocols that have been presented to us � that it�s possible for a person with a toy drone that you can purchase for a couple of quid, miles away from any planes, to cause an entire airport to stop having flights. It is quite an amazing situation � and once it became apparent that that was really a possibility it almost seemed criminal not to do it.�He added that drone technology, and the current law in the UK around how drones can be legally used, present an opportunity for activists to level up their environmental protest � �to cause so much disruption with so few people and so little effort� � that it�s simply �a no brainer�.During last year�s Gatwick drone debacle the spokesman said he received many enquiries from journalists asking if the group was responsible for that. They weren�t � but the mass chaos caused by the spectre of a few drones being flown near Gatwick provided inspiration for using drone technology for an environmental protest.The group�s website is hosting video interviews with some of the volunteer drone pilots who are willing to risk arrest to protest against the expansion of Heathrow Airport on environmental grounds.In a statement there, one of them, a 64-year-old writer called Valerie Milner-Brown, said: �We are in the middle of a climate and ecological emergency. I am a law-abiding citizen � a mother and a grandmother too. I don�t want to break the law, I don�t want to go to prison, but right now we, as a species, are walking off the edge of a cliff. Life on Earth is dying. Fires are ravaging the Amazon. Our planet�s lungs are quite literally on fire. Hundreds of species are going extinct every day. We are experiencing hottest day after hottest day, and the Arctic is melting faster than scientists� worst predictions.�All of this means that we have to cut emissions right now, or face widespread catastrophe on an increasingly uninhabitable planet. Heathrow Airport emits 18 million tons of CO2 a year. That�s more than most countries. A third runway will produce a further 7.3 million tons of CO2. For all Life � now and in the future � we have to take action. I�m terrified but if this is what it will take to make politicians, business leaders and the media wake up, then I�m prepared to take this action and to face the consequences.�",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/climate-activists-plan-to-use-drones-to-shut-down-heathrow-airport-next-month/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He said Australia wouldn't help because I am not white.""This is nonsense.

3572,Italy's President asks PM Conte to form new coalition,"Italy's president Sergio Mattarella asked PM Giuseppe Conte to head up a coalition of the 5-Star Movement and opposition Democratic Party (PD) on Thursday. PM Conte had lost the majority in the Parliament after its former partner League Party withdrew its support. To avoid fresh elections, rivals 5-Star Movement and Democratic Party decided to come together and form a government.",Reuters,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy�s president asked Giuseppe Conte to head up a coalition of the 5-Star Movement and opposition Democratic Party (PD) on Thursday, a move could that could improve Italy�s fractious relations with the European Union. Markets welcomed the prospect of a quick end to a three-week political crisis triggered by League leader Matteo Salvini, who pulled his hard-right party out of its governing alliance with 5-Star after weeks of public bickering.     Salvini had wanted fresh polls to capitalize on his party�s success in European elections but his plan backfired as 5-Star and the PD, lagging the League in opinion surveys, set aside their long-standing antipathy to form a government. Italy�s 10-year borrowing costs fell to an all-time low at auction on Thursday on the news as the prospect of a snap election retreated.  Conte, who told reporters he would present a cabinet list to the president in the coming days, said his priority was to draft a 2020 budget. �We must immediately get to work and draw up a budget to avert the VAT hike, protects savers and offers solid prospects for economic growth and social development,� he said.  VAT will rise from Jan. 1 unless the government can find 23 billion euros ($26 billion) elsewhere. The creation of a new government is not yet a done deal, however, and the two parties still need to agree a shared policy platform and divide up cabinet posts.  In a further complication, 5-Star has promised to put the deal with the PD to an online vote of its members. Many 5-Star supporters oppose a pact with the center-left and a �yes� vote is not a certainty. However, investors brushed off those concerns. Conte was seen as a voice of reason within the previous 5-Star/League coalition and investors are betting Italy will get a fiscally prudent government that will avoid confrontation with Europe. According to the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, an early draft of the incoming coalition�s policy platform would see it ask the EU for flexibility on the 2020 budget deficit to �reinforce social cohesion� in Italy.  The EU imposes budget rules on member states to ensure financial stability in the bloc. It has had a testy relationship with Rome under the outgoing administration, with League leader Salvini blaming EU rules for impoverishing Italians. Salvini had promised swinging tax cuts for 2020 that economists warned could put unsustainable pressure on Italy�s towering debt mountain. The PD leader Nicola Zingaretti said the priority for the new coalition would be to revive the stagnant economy. �As soon as it takes office, the government will have to act very quickly to relaunch the country � school, environment, infrastructure, investment to create work,� he said in a statement. Italy's battered blue-chip index .FTMIB was headed for its best weekly performance in six months on news of Conte's reappointment, and bond markets pushed Italy's 10-year borrowing costs to an all-time low.  �We think it will be less challenging to agree on an agenda between M5S (5-Star) and PD because the priorities both political forces have set out seem broadly consistent in many areas, ranging from fiscal policy to Italy�s relationship with the EU to a focus on a green economy,� UBS Wealth Management Italy�s Matteo Ramenghi said. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said Conte�s appointment was good news for Europe, adding: �I�m glad to see that the government crisis in Italy seems to have come to an end now and that a stable and new, progressive government can take the helm.� Conte, a quietly spoken academic with a penchant for smart suits, waistcoats and cufflinks, has enjoyed high poll ratings since he was plucked from relative obscurity 14 months ago to become premier. While he has no political affiliation he is considered close to 5-Star.

SBI has already tapped banks to run the IPO process and a listing is expected to happen in the last quarter of this financial year, bank officials have previously said. �Roughly about an 8% stake will be divested and after seeing the valuations and the inputs we are getting it would translate to 80 billion rupees,� said the source directly involved in the process, who asked not to be named as the details are not public. This would value the overall business at about 1 trillion rupees ($14 billion).  SBI and SBI Card did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  At the end of March 31, 2019, SBI Card, which is 74% owned by SBI and 26% by U.S private equity firm Carlyle Group (CG.O),  had total assets worth 195.93 billion rupees. India�s credit card market is still small compared to its debit card market. The latest regulatory data shows that there were 49.6 million credit cards in circulation in the country, compared with 836 million debit cards.  SBI Card is the second-largest credit card issuer in the country, with 8.8 million outstanding cards as of June 30. It only trails private lender HDFC Bank (HDBK.NS) in terms of the number of cards issued.  Earlier this year, home-grown ride hailing company Ola had partnered with SBI Card to launch a co-branded credit card, allowing the company to expand its customer base.  SBI�s management has been looking at selling its investment in non-core assets to raise capital.  SBI Card will be SBI�s second subsidiary to be listed.

He'd written about the military's role in politics and Myanmar's 2008 constitution. Gyi was convicted under a law which bans sharing statements that might induce a soldier ""to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in duties"".",Reuters,"YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar court on Thursday sentenced a prominent filmmaker to one year in prison with hard labour for Facebook posts that criticised the military. Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi was arrested in April and accused of breaking a colonial-era law that bans statements that could cause a soldier or other service member �to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in his duty�. His Facebook posts criticised the military�s role in politics and the country�s 2008 constitution, which was drawn up by the former ruling junta and which civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi is attempting to amend. Speaking outside the court, Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi told reporters he had expected the verdict. �Please, don�t worry about me, I�ll be back,� he said. �I also want to urge everyone to march together vigorously for amending the constitution with our leaders�. Although Suu Kyi took power after a landslide election win in 2015, the charter reserves key political roles for the military, including a quarter of seats in parliament. Her ruling National League for Democracy party has proposed gradually cutting the number of military representatives in parliament over a period of 15 years. Government spokesman Zaw Htay said he could not immediately comment on the case. Two military spokesmen did not answer calls seeking comment. Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi�s lawyer, Robert San Aung, told Reuters he would appeal the ruling.  �His writings do not comply with the characteristics of the section he was charged with,� San Aung said. �It didn�t cause mutiny or disrespect within the military�. Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi recently had surgery for liver cancer, San Aung said, adding that he worried about his client�s health in prison.  According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners human rights group, 161 people are in jail or on trial in Myanmar on what the group says are politically motivated charges. Maung Saungkha, an activist with the human rights organisation Athan, said the sentence was a �harsh blow to the freedom of speech in Myanmar�. Human Rights Watch also condemned the ruling. �Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi should never have been arrested, much less prosecuted and imprisoned, for airing critical views about Myanmar�s rights abusing military,� Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said in a statement. He urged the civilian government to use its overwhelming majority in parliament to revoke laws which �clearly violate the right of free expression�.

Previously, parents would have to download the YouTube Kids app to a mobile device in order to access the filtered version of YouTube.By bringing YouTube Kids to the web, the company is prepared for the likely outcome of an FTC  settlement that would require the company to implement an age-gate on its site, then redirect under-13-year-olds to a separate kid-friendly experience.In addition, YouTube Kids is gaining a new filter, which will allow parents to set the content to being preschooler-appropriate.The announcement, published to the YouTube Help forums, was first spotted by Android Police.It�s unclear if YouTube was intentionally trying to keep these changes from being noticed by a larger audience (or the press) by publishing the news to a forum instead of its official YouTube blog.

But with an FTC settlement looming, it seems an odd destination for such a key announcement.)It�s also worth noting that, around the same time as the news was published, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki posted her quarterly update for YouTube creators.The update is intended to keep creators abreast of what�s in store for YouTube and its community. But this quarter, her missive spoke solely about the value in being an open platform, and didn�t touch on anything related to kids content or the U.S. regulator�s investigation.However, it�s precisely YouTube�s position on �openness� that concerns parents when it comes to their kids watching YouTube videos. The platform�s (almost) �anything goes� nature means kids can easily stumble upon content that�s too adult, controversial, hateful, fringe or offensive.The YouTube Kids app is meant to offer a safer destination, but YouTube isn�t manually reviewing each video that finds its way there. That has led to inappropriate and disturbing content slipping through the cracks�on numerous occasions, and eroding parents� trust.Because many parents don�t believe YouTube Kids� algorithms can filter content appropriately, the company last fall introduced the ability for parents to whitelist specific videos or channels in the Kids app. It also rolled out a feature that customized the app�s content for YouTube�s older users, ages 8 through 12. This added gaming content and music videos.Now, YouTube is further breaking into two parts its �Younger� content-level filter, which was previously 8 and under. Starting now, �Younger� applies to ages 5 through 7, while the new �Preschool� filter is for the age 4 and under group. The latter will focus on videos that promote �creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration,� says YouTube.Above: the content filter beforeYouTube confirmed to TechCrunch that its forum announcement is accurate, but the company would not say when the YouTube Kids web version would go live, beyond �this week.�The YouTube Kids changes are notable because they signal that YouTube is getting things in place before an FTC settlement announcement that will impact how the company handles content for kids and its continued use by young children.It�s possible that YouTube will be fined by the FTC for its violations of COPPA, as Musical.ly (TikTok) was earlier this year.�One report, citing unnamed sources, says the FTC�s YouTube settlement has, in fact, already been finalized and includes a multimillion-dollar fine.YouTube will also likely be required to implement an age-gate on its site and in its apps that will direct under-13-year-olds to the YouTube Kids platform instead of YouTube proper. The settlement may additionally require YouTube to stop targeting ads on videos aimed at children, as has been reported by Bloomberg.�We probably won�t see the FTC issuing a statement about its ruling ahead of this Labor Day weekend, but it may do so in advance of its October workshop focused on refining the COPPA regulation � an event that has the regulator looking for feedback on how to properly handle sites like YouTube.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/ahead-of-ftc-ruling-youtube-kids-is-getting-a-website/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It may be noted that according to the ""First In First Out"" policy, the goods purchased first are sold first.Delhi excise department during its inspection observed that liquor stock at the bar counter is not disposed of/served in order of their receipt from the liquor store. It further observed that while the old stock of liquor is still available at the bar counter, the fresh stock which was received comparatively on a later date from liquor store to the bar counter is actually served to the customers.The department notice said, ""It has been brought to the notice of this department that this practice of not following First In First Out and keeping liquor bottles at the bar counter for a duration beyond their normal period of consumption has potential of misuse through refilling/adulteration.""While the time limit for destroying beer, wines including champagne and alcopops would be three days in order of their receipt from the liquor store, other liquors such as whiskey, gin, vodka, rum, scotch and tequila having a maximum retail price up to Rs 1,500 are required to be removed from the counter in five days.

3609,Half of India police feel Muslims more likely to commit crime: Study,"Half of India's police force feel that Muslims are naturally more likely to commit crimes, according to a survey of around 12,000 police personnel across 21 states. The study by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) and Common Cause further said that one in three police staff felt mob violence in cases of cow slaughter was ""natural"".",The Quint,"Video Editor: Ashutosh BharadwajNearly half of India�s police force feels that Muslims are naturally more likely to commit violence, while one in every three policemen maintain that it is only natural for a mob to punish the alleged accused in cases of cow slaughter, says a study conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) and Common Cause. The report, titled Status of Policing in India 2019, is based on a survey of around 12,000 policemen and women across 21 states.While the report focuses extensively on working conditions on India�s police force, it also delves into how they perceive the world in which they operate.This is in contrast to 33 percent of the police force (�Very Likely� � 6 percent, �Somewhat Likely� � 27 percent) which feels that Upper Castes are likely to commit criminal offences. Moreover, two-thirds of the police force surveyed in Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Bihar are of the view that Muslims are more likely to commit criminal offences. The trend is particularly worrying in Uttarakhand, where four out of five policemen hold a similar view.In Uttar Pradesh, where the Muslim population stands at nearly 19 percent, nearly 56 percent (�Very Likely� � 20 percent, �Somewhat Likely� � 36 percent) of the police force believes that Muslims are more prone to committing criminal acts.Also Read : Voters Had Heard of �Chowkidar�, Not Much of �NYAY�: CSDSSocial activist and Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sanghatan Founder Aruna Roy, who was one of the panelists at the event to mark the release of the report, said �these numbers reveal a steady erosion of values enshrined in our Constitution. We need to re-look at these values and ensure that they are imbibed by policing agencies.�Former Uttar Pradesh DGP Prakash Singh, who spoke on law of order, first said that such generalisations against Muslims are unwarranted and unwelcome, since criminals come from various backgrounds. However, when asked about the cause behind such a mindset, Singh said �while everybody commits crimes, Muslims commit it rather aggressively.�Also Read : Trainee Cops Are Failing Exams Yet No Police Reforms in SightAlthough at the national level, the report did not find any major difference in how the police perceive various caste-groups in terms of their criminal tendencies, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka had the highest number of policemen who believed that Dalits were more prone to committing crime.So far as Adivasis and tribals are concerned, the report found that �While Rajasthan and Maharashtra had about half of the police personnel reporting that Adivasis are likely to be naturally prone towards committing crimes, about two-fifth of the police personnel in Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand and Gujarat believe so, all states which fall under the Fifth Schedule, 6 except Uttarakhand.�It's not just perception, the report mentions that over half of the police force feels that complains registered under �The Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989� are false and motivated. While 21 percent said that complains registered under the SC/ST Act were �very much� false, around 30 percent believed the said complaints were fictitious.A closer look reveals �about three-fifth of the upper-caste police personnel to be more likely to believe that in their experience complaints under the SC/ST (PoA) Act are false and motivated (�very much� and �somewhat� combined), while SC and ST police personnel believing so were 9 and 20 percentage points lesser, respectively.�The report also sheds light on what the police force thinks about cases of mob violence that have risen over the years. According to the report, one in every three policemen across the country feel that it is natural for a mob to punish an alleged accused in cases of cow slaughter. This number is particularly high in Madhya Pradesh, where about 63 percent of the state�s police force feels that mob lynching in cases of cow slaughter is natural (�Very Much � 39 percent, �Somewhat� � 24 percent).In Uttar Pradesh, 23 percent of policemen feel its is very much natural for a mob to lynch in cow slaughter cases, while 14 percent feel that it is somewhat natural.Also Read : 12 Mob Lynching Cases Reported in Bihar in 15 Days: Patna Police(Hi there!

It is satisfying in every medium mostly because I am acting, I am performing. But theatre has a slight edge, there is a live audience in front of you.""""In theatre there is a certain discipline that you have to follow, and you have to be experienced to be performing in front of a live audience.

Once people update to the new versions of its OS, they will have the chance to say yes to the grading process that uses audio recordings to help verify requests that users make of Siri. This effectively means that every user of Siri will be opted out of this process once the update goes live and is installed.Apple says that it will continue using anonymized computer-generated written transcripts of your request to feed its machine learning engines with data, in a fashion similar to other voice assistants. These transcripts may be subject to Apple employee review.Amazon  and Google  had previous revelations that their assistants were being helped along by human review of audio, and they have begun putting opt-ins in place as well.Apple is making changes to the grading process itself as well, noting that, for example, �the names of the devices and rooms you setup in the Home app will only be accessible by the reviewer if the request being graded involves controlling devices in the home.�A story in The Guardian in early August outlined how Siri audio samples were sent to contractors Apple had hired to evaluate the quality of responses and transcription that Siri produced for its machine learning engines to work on. The practice is not unprecedented, but it certainly was not made as clear as it should have been in Apple�s privacy policies that humans were involved in the process. There was also the matter that contractors, rather than employees, were being used to evaluate these samples. One contractor described audio as containing sensitive and private information that, in some cases, may have been able to be tied to a user, even with Apple�s anonymizing processes in place.In response, Apple halted the grading process worldwide while it reviewed the process. This post and updates to its process are the result of that review.Apple says that around 0.2% of all Siri requests got this audio treatment in the first place, but given that there are 15 billion requests per month, the quick math tells us that though it is statistically insignificant, the raw numbers could be quite high.The move away from contractors was signaled by Apple releasing employees in Europe, as noted by Alex Hearn earlier on Wednesday.Apple is also publishing an FAQ on how Siri�s privacy controls fit in with its grading process; you can read that in full here.The blog post from Apple and the FAQ provide some details to consumers about how Apple handles the grading process, how it is minimizing the data given to data reviewers in the grading process and how Siri privacy is preserved.Apple�s work with Siri from the beginning has focused enormously on on-device processing whenever possible. This has led a lot of experts to say that Apple was trading raw capability for privacy by eschewing the data-center heavy processes of assistants from companies like Amazon or Google in favor of keeping a �personal cloud� of data on device. Sadly, the lack of transparency on human review processes and the use of contractors undercut all of this foundational work Apple has been doing from the beginning. So it�s good that Apple is cranking all the way back to past industry standard on its privacy policies regarding grading and improvement. That is where it needs to be.The fact is that no other assistant product is nearly as privacy focused as Siri � as I said above, some would say to the point of hampering its ability to advance as quickly. Hopefully this episode leads to better transparency on the part of Apple when humans get involved in processes that are presumed to be fully automated.Most people assume that �AI� or �machine learning� mean computers only, but the sad fact is that most of those processes are intensely human driven still because AI (which doesn�t really exist) and ML are still pretty crap. Humans will be involved in making them seem smarter for a very long time yet.Love watching people realize that ""AI"" is really just a people-sized rat king. https://t.co/Zfx7NzYAO3� Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) August 13, 2019",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/apple-is-turning-siri-audio-clip-review-off-by-default-and-bringing-it-in-house/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3619,Uber proposes $21/hour minimum wage for US drivers after protests,"Uber has proposed a policy that would offer drivers a minimum wage of $21 per hour, following protests by its drivers in US. In the petition, Uber advocates for a policy that would also allow drivers paid time off, sick leave and compensation if they are injured while driving. The policy would classify drivers as employees instead of independent contractors.",TechCrunch,"On the heels of a driver-led protest outside Uber�s San Francisco headquarters, where drivers showed their support for gig worker protections legislation (via Assembly Bill 5) and demanded a union, Uber  is circulating a petition urging people to �protect ridesharing in California.� In the petition, Uber advocates for a policy that would offer drivers a minimum of $21 per hour while on a trip,* paid time off, sick leave and compensation if they are injured while driving, as well as a collective voice and �the ability to influence decisions about their work.�Uber has also created a new website called �Independent Driver� to showcase stories from drivers who want to remain independent contractors. Lyft, similarly, is circulating a petition urging people to demand legislators �fix AB 5.��We agree with the bill�s goal to protect workers, but we don�t agree that this protection should come at the cost of the flexibility our community relies on to supplement their income, support their families, and set their own schedules,� Lyft wrote in its petition. �After talking with thousands of California drivers and listening to experts in labor laws, we�re proposing a revision that protects driver earnings and the flexibility to earn when and how you want. Our proposal includes additional workplace protections for drivers and a minimum earnings floor.��Everything that Uber and Lyft are offering is insulting to drivers,� Lauren Casey of Gig Workers Rising told TechCrunch. �This is nothing new. All they�ve done since AB5 was introduced is spread misinformation and fear. This shows us that Uber and Lyft are worried. Drivers have been organizing and fighting hard for AB5 for months, and, it�s working.�These petitions are clearly Hail Marys by Lyft and Uber to try to prevent the passage of AB-5, which seeks to codify the ruling established in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors based on the presumption that �a worker who performs services for a hirer is an employee for purposes of claims for wages and benefits��According to the�ABC test, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, performs work outside the scope of the entity�s business and is regularly engaged in an �independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.�In short, AB-5, which has already passed in the California State Assembly, would ensure gig economy workers are entitled to minimum wage, workers� compensation and other benefits.*This story has been updated to clarify that Uber is proposing to pay drivers $21 per hour while on a trip.

Before he could continue, the police whisked him away to an unknown location,� the report stated.Curiously, the police vehicle in which Omar was taken away had its number plate covered.On 5 August, the Modi-led government had abrogated Article 370 which gives special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir.

Intersex is used for people born with variations in sex characteristics, that don't fit typical definitions of female or male.",The News Minute,"In a progressive move, the Tamil Nadu government has banned sex reassignment surgeries on intersex infants and children. In a Government Order (GO) released earlier this month, the state government quoted a World Health Organisation report, that clearly says that such �sex normalising procedures� are medically unnecessary and often irreversible, with lifelong consequences for the physical and mental health of the intersex person.�Intersex� is a term used for persons who are born with variations in sex charecteristics, that do not conform to what we typically think of as �male� or �female�. For instance, they may have genitals that are not typically male or female; or their chromosomes may not be �xx� or �xy�; or they may have hormonal variations that are not typically understood as �male� or �female�. In several cases, doctors and parents perform surgeries on intersex infants and children to make them �conform� to male or female gender � however, these surgeries are medically unnecessary, and can be harmful to the children. Experts have maintained that intersex children should be allowed to grow up and decide what they would like to do with their bodies.Now, with this GO, Tamil Nadu has become the first state in India to ban such surgeries. The GO follows two important judgments: In 2014, the Supreme Court in the landmark NALSA judgment had said that such surgeries on infants and children should be banned; and earlier this year, the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court had reiterated the Supreme Court�s stand, and suo motu asked the Secretary of Health and Family Department to ensure that this is done in the state.The government has said that unless there is a life-threatening situation, such surgeries should be banned on intersex infants and children. Further, they�ve ordered the formation of a committee comprising of a pediatric surgeon or urologist; an endocrinologist; a social worker or psychology worker or intersex activist; and a government representative not below the rank of Under Secretary. This committee, along with the Director of Medical Education in the state, will advise the government on whether a specific case is a life threatening situation where a sex reassignment surgery needs to be performed on a minor, and the government will take the final call.The GO has been welcomed by activists from the LGBTQI+ community. �It�s a positive step, but there are certain gaps that need to be addressed,� said intersex activist Gopi Shankar, who had written to the Health Ministry regarding the issue.�The first is that they haven't mentioned what surgeries are included under the ban and haven't specified the types of intersex variations included. Also, we need a more scientific approach to determine whether something is life threatening,� Gopi said.Srishti Madurai, an organisation that Gopi works with, released a statement which further recommended that the government must specify punishments for those who don�t follow the ban.Gopi further said, �Currently, this is a decision that has come from the judiciary and has become a GO. It needs to become a law however for it to be implemented properly. The court's powers are limited.""C Moulee, founder of Queer Chennai Chronicles meanwhile pointed out that hospitals need to be sensitised on the subject as well for this GO to be implemented well. ""This is definitely a precedence to tackling the larger issue,"" said Moulee, ""But the awareness must start from hospitals. They are the ones who suggest these surgeries and counselling must also be given to parents of intersex children who are under pressure due to social conditioning.""",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/first-tn-govt-bans-sex-reassignment-surgeries-intersex-infants-and-children-108025?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The error allowed thousands of children to join group chats with people who weren't approved by their parents. It incurred in October 2018, 10 months after the app was introduced.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) acknowledged a flaw in its Messenger Kids app, weeks after two U.S. senators raised privacy concerns about the application, and said that it spoke to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about the matter. �We are in regular contact with the FTC on many issues and products, including Messenger Kids,� Facebook Vice President Kevin Martin wrote in a letter to two Democrats, which is seen by Reuters. He described the flaw as a �technical error�. The letter dated Aug. 27 was sent to Democratic Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. �Based on our review, we have determined that the technical error you have inquired above arose in October 2018. The fix we implemented is designed to prevent the issue from happening again,� Facebook said in the letter. The senators said on Wednesday they were disappointed by Facebook�s approach on the matter. �We are particularly disappointed that Facebook did not commit to undertaking a comprehensive review of Messenger Kids to identify additional bugs or privacy issues,� Markey and Blumenthal said in response to Facebook�s letter. The senators had written to Facebook on Aug. 6 questioning whether there was a �worrying pattern� of poor privacy protection for children using the Messenger Kids app and sought transparency. The senators were �disturbed� to learn that the application allowed thousands of children to join group chats in which not all members of the group were approved by their parents, they said in the letter to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. In July, Facebook agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine to resolve an FTC probe into its privacy practices and will boost safeguards on user data.

Although she had done a few roles before that, her performance in that film became her calling card, so much so that people started recognising her by her character in that film rather than her real name.

As the actress gears up for her new film Dream Girl�opposite Ayushmann Khurrana, she hopes people know her name so that she can get rid of the tag of 'Panchnama Girl'�for good.

""Initially I was taking the tag of 'Panchnama girl' sportingly but then I realised that people called me by that name more than my real name! Thankfully after the success of 'Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety', things have changed,"" Nushrat told IANS here.

While she had no problem with the tag, she said: ""I wondered why would people only call me the 'Panchnama girl' whereas there were two more girls in the film! Did they only remember me and Kartik and not the rest? However, I am happy the way things have panned out now.""

Australia had won the first match by 251 runs.The English fans will look to see more from the New Zealand-born all-rounder who had some career-threatening events a few years ago. But Stokes has learnt lessons from the experiences and has evolved into a modern-day great for England.

3702,South American nations to meet to discuss Amazon forest fires,"South American nations will meet to discuss the response to the fires in the Amazon rainforests, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro announced on Wednesday. All South American nations except Venezuela will meet on September 6. Bolsonaro further said that he has also accepted Chile's offer of four aircraft to help fight the fires.",Reuters,"BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday he would meet with other South American countries to set common policy for defending the Amazon rain forest, while his foreign minister told Reuters the nation should be seen as an environmental hero. In an indication that Bolsonaro, a far-right conservative, is forging closer ties with neighboring countries than with European nations, he accepted Chile�s offer of four aircraft to help fight the fires sweeping through the world�s largest rain forest. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in Brasilia, Bolsonaro said a meeting with regional neighbors except Venezuela to discuss the Amazon would be held on Sept. 6 in Leticia, Colombia. In a statement, the two leaders said environmental challenges must be met while respecting �national sovereignty.� Each country, it added, should have control over the �rational and sustainable use of their natural resources, in line with their environmental obligations and needs of their citizens, including indigenous peoples.� Pinera, who has a close relationship with Bolsonaro, is an increasingly important figure in the environmental crisis triggered by the Amazon fires, and visited Brasilia on his return from a G7 summit in France where he attended as the rotating representative for Latin America.  Chile will hold the COP25 climate summit in December, having taken it over from the original host, Brazil, after Bolsonaro was elected.     Following a meeting with Paraguayan President Mario Abdo later on Wednesday, Pinera spoke of the need to build out regionwide infrastructure to fight increasingly prevalent forest fires in South America. Pinera said new regional bloc Prosur could contribute to the effort. Bolsonaro waded back into a spat with France, saying Brazil�s sovereignty had �no price, not even $20 trillion,� a reference to an offer of $20 million aid announced by French President Emmanuel Macron at the Group of Seven summit of wealthy nations over the weekend. Bolsonaro dismissed the offer as an insulting attempt to �buy� Brazil�s sovereignty. Macron has accused Bolsonaro, a longtime skeptic of environmental concerns, of lying about climate change.  �Only after it (the French government) has recanted what it said about my person, which represents Brazil ... can we talk again,� Bolsonaro said. In an interview with Reuters, Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo said the country supported Bolsonaro in his dispute with Macron. He also said that Brazil was fighting forest fires like never before and that he hoped �people who legitimately care about the environment see that Brazil is the hero and not the villain.� A Reuters report on Wednesday found that Bolsonaro�s government had weakened the federal agency charged with protecting the rain forest through budget cuts, restrictions on destroying equipment used in environmental crime, and the sidelining of an elite force of enforcement agents. Brazil�s federal government is preparing a presidential decree forbidding fires to clear land in the country during the dry season, the presidency said on Wednesday.  According to one source, Bolsonaro had already agreed to the main terms of the decree.    Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, 44, was admitted to a hospital unit on Tuesday after complaining of feeling unwell. The Armed Forces Hospital in Brasilia said on Wednesday that the minister was given the all-clear after some medical tests and told to rest for five days.

3708,US to not release Middle East peace plan before Israel polls,"The US will not release the political portion of its Israeli-Palestinian peace plan before Israel's elections, White House Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt said on Wednesday. The US had announced the economic portion of its plan in June that proposes aid worth $50 billion for the region. Israeli general elections are scheduled to take place on September 17.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will not release the long-delayed political portion of its Israeli-Palestinian peace plan before Israel�s elections next month, White House Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt said on Wednesday. The move, announced in a tweet by Greenblatt, keeps the plan�s details from becoming an issue in the election, in which the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, is at stake. �We have decided that we will not be releasing the peace vision (or parts of it) prior to the Israeli election,� Greenblatt said on Twitter. Trump�s son-in-law Jared Kushner has been working behind the scenes on the plan to resolve the decades-old Israeli Palestinian conflict, although Palestinians, who say the Trump administration is too pro-Israel, say it is dead in the water. A goal to raise tens of billions of dollars to fund the plan was announced earlier this year, but the political details have remained under wraps, with Kushner refusing to say even whether it would offer Palestinians a state of their own. Trump on Monday had said the plan might be revealed before the Israeli election. At a campaign rally on Wednesday, Netanyahu said he expected the U.S. proposal would not be delayed for much longer. �This evening we learned that President Trump�s �deal of century� would be published and presented to the world after the election. I can reasonably estimate that it will happen very soon after the election,� Netanyahu said. Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014. The Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, areas Israel captured in a 1967 war. Israel moved troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005 and still occupies the West Bank. Trump�s Middle East team, including Kushner, had wanted to roll out the plan during the summer but Netanyahu�s failure to put together a governing coalition after April elections prompted a delay. Netanyahu now faces a fresh vote on Sept. 17 and, if successful, will try again to form a coalition. Announcing a peace plan before Sept. 17 could have complicated a tight race in which Netanyahu�s right-wing Likud party and its strongest rival - Blue and White, led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz - are running neck and neck in the polls. Netanyahu has praised Trump policy moves such as the transfer of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel�s capital and its annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. But any perceived concessions towards the Palestinians in the peace plan in the run-up to a ballot only three weeks away could have harmed Netanyahu�s chances of remaining in office. Netanyahu has campaigned for votes partly by highlighting his close relationship with Trump, whom he has featured on election billboards. �Who do you want to negotiate with President Trump on the �deal of the century�?� Netanyahu asked the crowd at Wednesday�s rally. �Me, at the head of a right-wing and Likud government, or Gantz and (Blue and White co-leader Yair) Lapid? �That�s the question in this election, because we will be faced, full force, with the (peace) issue in a few weeks� time.� The White House in June announced the economic piece of the Trump peace plan and sought support for it at a conference of global finance ministers in Bahrain. It proposes a $50 billion investment plan that would create a global investment fund to lift the Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies, and fund a $5 billion transportation corridor to connect the West Bank and Gaza. Gulf leaders, however, want to see details of the political plan before signing on to the economic plan. (Corrects day to Wednesday in paragraph 16.)

3709,Amazon moves SC against HC order barring sales of D2C brands,"Amazon Seller Services has moved the Supreme Court challenging Delhi High Court's order which bars e-commerce platforms from selling products of direct-to-consumer (D2C) entities without their consent. Amazon reportedly contests that barring them from selling certain categories might set a precedent for other categories too. The HC judgment had come on pleas filed by Amway, Oriflame and Modicare.",Entrackr,"A month after Delhi High Court restrained e-commerce platforms from selling products of direct selling entities without their consent, Amazon Seller Services has moved to the Supreme Court opposing the judgement.Amazon contest the ruling as barring e-comm platforms from selling specific categories might lead to a precedent for other categories said ET report quoting industry official aware of the development.Direct selling platforms contribute a very less percentage to sales on e-comm platforms. Though, Amazon has not officially put out words on the matter.Amway India believes that Delhi HC judgement was correct and in the interest of the consumers and direct sellers. The company is confident that the apex court will also arrive at the same judgement.Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA) chairman Vivek Katoch is hopeful that e-comm platforms and sellers would not be allowed to sell their products without consent.In July, the Delhi HC had passed an interim order to prevent e-comm platforms from advertising, displaying or selling Amway products without direct selling brand�s consent. Platforms were accused of violation of the Direct Selling Guidelines, 2016 by offering unauthorised sale.Amway, Modicare and Oriflame, who mainly deal in healthcare and beauty products, alleged that e-comm platforms are sourcing and selling their products in an unauthorised manner at cheaper rates, resulting in financial losses to companies.They further said that their products are being tampered and sold without unique codes and QR codes on these platforms while hiding the sellers� names and contact details.Delhi HC in the ruling said that irreparable injury would be caused to plaintiffs, their businesses, and all those who depend on plaintiffs� successful business, such as employees, distributors/direct sellers, agents, and finally, the consumers if interim relief is not granted.Earlier last year in October, Amway had dragged Flipkart to court, alleging it of unauthorised selling of the US direct-selling giant�s products. Amway also had filed cases against e-comm companies including Snapdeal and online pharma seller 1mg.com.Soon after the Court intervention, Snapdeal complied with the Court order and had taken down products.",https://entrackr.com/2019/08/amazon-moves-sc-delhi-hc-order-direct-selling-firms/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3714,"After Priyanka's photoshop, fan edits Ashwin's wife near bowler in pic","A fan photoshopped Team India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's wife Prithi near the bowler in a picture wherein Ashwin was seen on a cruise along with Virat Kohli, Anushka Sharma, Mayank Agarwal and KL Rahul. The fan attributed Priyanka Chopra's photoshopped pic with Nick Jonas as his inspiration. Reacting to the fan's pic, Prithi wrote, ""HAHAHAHA but but but #whythegap?""",CricTracker,"Ravi Ashwin is currently on the tour to West Indies but wasn�t picked in the XI for the first of the two-match Test series, as Team India registered a massive and record-making 318 runs win over the hosts in Antigua. Ravindra Jadeja was preferred over Ashwin and Jadeja justified his selection with a brilliant half-century in 1st innings saving India from a subpar total.Ashwin, who boasts of an amazing record against West Indies with four Test centuries and 60 wickets in just 11 matches. The ace-spinner with 342 Test wickets in 65 matches last played in Tests for India against Australia in January this year and was then injured. He, in the meantime, played English county cricket and IPL 2019. He is no longer considered for the limited-overs format in the Indian team and has competition from Kuldeep Yadav in Tests as well.AdvertisementRecently, he was spotted spending some time away from the field, relaxing on a cruise in the Caribbean with KL Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Virat Kohli, and Kohli�s better-half Anushka Sharma. However, it seems like an Ashwin fan didn�t find it nice that the offie�s wife Prithi wasn�t with him on the cruise, to give company to Anushka and photoshopped her with him.Prithi Narayanan had a good laugh at the attempted photoshop effort and jokingly looked angry with the gap between her and Ashwin and quipped, �HAHAHAHA but but but #whythegap ?�It looked similar to what Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra had done recently when she photoshopped herself with beau Nick Jonas, who was standing alone at the recent MTV Video Music Awards. The Jonas Brothers � Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas � won Best Pop Song for Sucker at the star-studded awards night. Joe and Kevin were accompanied by their wives Sophie Turner and Danielle Jonas; Nick look awkward alone and Priyanka did the needful using the photo editing software.Meanwhile, India will be playing the second Test against West Indies at the Sabina Park ground in Kingston, Jamaica which starts from August 30. Virat Kohli and his men will be looking forward to winning this man and adding 60 more points to their kitty in the ongoing ICC World Test Championship point table, where they are the no.1 ranked team.",https://www.crictracker.com/fan-photoshops-prithi-with-ravi-ashwin-just-like-priyanka-chopra-photoshopped-herself-hugging-nick-jonas/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
