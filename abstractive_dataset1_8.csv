""A versatile actor is able to play same role differently,"" he added. ""If I get an opportunity to play the lead, I'll do it on the basis of my style,"" Siddiqui said.",Times Now,"New Delhi: Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui feels the Bollywood hero is the most cliched creation one can think of, adding that he likes to keep a distance from that image.""I have played a variety of roles, be it gangster, a writer or a policeman. Even if I get an opportunity to play the lead hero in a movie, I will do it only on the basis of my style,"" Nawazuddin told IANS. ""The Bollywood hero is one of the most cliched roles (that) you will find. People have this conception on how they see him, the kind of clothes he wears etc. This is a zone I ideally don't want to be a part of because then you go into an absolute comfort zone,"" he added. According to Nawazuddin, anybody can play the hero but the difficult part is to play the same role differently each time. ""For this, you need an education and practice. According to me, a versatile actor is one who is able to play the same role differently. For example, I have played the mafia don several times, whether it is Faisal Khan or Ganesh Gaitonde. But each role is different, as there is always that one signature dialogue/move that sets the character apart from the other. I did the same even with Dilly Mahmood (in McMafia) too,"" added the actor. Starting off with bit roles in films such as Sarfarosh and Shool, Nawazuddin made a name for himself by associating with projects such as Gangs of Wasseypur, The Lunchbox, Liar's Dice, Badlapur, Manjhi: The Mountain Man, Kick, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Lion, Mom and Sacred Games. The actor was happy to be a part of the television crime drama McMafia, which is about Alex Godman (essayed by James Norton), an educated hedge-fund manager who unwillingly gets sucked into the lawless world of his Russian mafia family. Nawazuddin features as Mumbai-based gangster Dilly Mahmood in the show, aired in India on Zee Cafe. The show is inspired by the 2009 non-fiction book of the same name by Misha Glenny and explores the world of organised crime.Talking about his experience of working with director James Watkins on McMafia, Nawazuddin said: ""James Watkins has been following me since Gangs of Wasseypur and it is my performance in this movie, along with Miss Lovely and The Lunchbox, that eventually helped me bag my role in McMafia. ""Watkins is an experienced and passionate director and has also directed a few episodes of Black Mirror. He is somebody who keeps a keen eye for detail and beautifully brings out the smallest element in each shot. On McMafia, the overall experience was great, not just working with the director but all the other actors who were apart of the show,"" he said. In fact, Nawazuddin stumbled upon Norton's India connect while working on the show. ""While shooting, he once told me that he had come to India almost 15-20 years ago as a backpacker, and during his stay he ran out of money. In order to make some money, James appeared in the crowd scene of a Bollywood film,"" said the Indian actor. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/nawazuddin-siddiqui-says-he-doesnt-want-to-become-cliched-bollywood-hero/464989?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6372,Kerala govt asks HC to cancel IAS' bail who ran over journalist,"Kerala government has asked High Court to cancel suspended IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman's bail in the alleged case of drunken driving leading to a journalist's death. The government said the bail was granted after Venkitaraman's medical report didn't find alcohol in his blood sample. However, the government added there were people claiming Venkitaraman was drunk at the time of accident.",The News Minute,"A day after the Judicial Magistrate of Thiruvananthapuram granted bail to Sriram Venkitaraman (32), an IAS officer under suspension, the Kerala government has approached the High Court asking for a cancellation of the bail. Sriram has been booked under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, for causing the death of a journalist named Basheer, by ramming his over-speeding car into the scribe’s bike.The Kerala government, in its petition to the High Court, has said that the Magistrate has based his judgment solely on the fact that the Chemical Examiner's Laboratory in Thiruvananthapuram has not found traces of alcohol in Sriram’s blood sample. The government has said that the Magistrate has not considered the gravity of offence and that there was sufficient material to charge him under Section 304.The petition filed by the Assistant Commissioner of Narcotics cell on behalf of the government says that Sriram misled the police by giving false statement that the vehicle was driven by his friend, Wafa, who is also the registered owner of the vehicle. Moreover, the Magistrate has failed to acknowledge that the accused is a doctor by qualification and an IAS officer in Kerala cadre and is therefore highly influential, the government says.The petition says that though Sriram was taken to the General Hospital soon after the accident, a doctor there asked him to consult a surgeon and referred him to Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, Surgery Casualty.The doctor at GH also noted that he was smelling of alcohol. Despite the doctor referring him to the Medical College, Sriram went to KIMS Hospital, a private hospital without informing the police. It was only after 9.45 am that the police located him and were able to take his blood sample.The government has alleged that this act by Sriram, who is well aware of its medical as well as legal aspects, in collusion with the doctors of KIMS hospital, was to destroy the evidence of his alcohol consumption.The government has alleged that Sriram drove the car at high speed, well aware of the risk posed to others. He and Wafa, his passenger, lied to the police that she had driven the car. The petition also says that the bail was granted without taking into consideration the statements given by two witnesses who concurred that Sriram was driving at high speed and hit the motorcycle from behind. The two witnesses have also informed the police that Sriram was in an inebriated state.The petition says that the tyres of the car Sriram was driving skidded for 17 meters and is a clear indication of the speed of the vehicle at the time of occurrence.Arguing that Sriram being a Civil Service Officer can influence witnesses and tamper evidence, the Kerala government has asked the court to cancel the bail.Though the government has asked the court to cancel bail, it has offered no explanation as to why alcohol content could not be traced in Sriram’s blood and whether delay on behalf of police officers in collecting the samples led to this.Read: Kerala IAS officer Sriram gets bail in accident case, without spending a night in jailKerala IAS officer Sriram suspended from service after arrest in accident caseWhen icons fall off pedestals: How Kerala reacted to arrest of Sriram IAS",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/cancel-sriram-ias-bail-he-lied-cops-will-hamper-probe-kerala-govt-sc-106799?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Tomorrow, we will take Balochistan and PoK. I have trust in this government that it'll fulfil the dream of undivided India,"" Raut has been quoted in the poster as saying.  
 
This has come when Parliament has passed the historic Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill 2019, that splits the state into two Union Territories. Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday had moved a resolution apprising the Rajya Sabha that the President has issued an order revoking Article 370.Article 370 that was ushered in almost two years after post-accession to India (1947 being the accession year within months of Independence from British raj) gave Kashmir its own constitution and restricted the Centre's powers to mere matters of defence, communications and external affairs. For any other area, the Centre had to get the state legislature's approval. Further Article 370 legitimised Article 35A that empowered the J&K government to define permanent residents of the state and make special reservations for them. It barred 'outsiders' (not originally from the state) from buying property in J&K or claiming government jobs and educational scholarships. As for the posters, reports suggest that they might have been put up by Baloch activists who have been fighting for decades for their rights and freedom within Pakistan but have been labelled as traitors and extremists. Meanwhile, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and its Army General Qamar Javed Bajwa have warned of repercussions for India. While Imran Khan said that such moves will lead to incidents like the one in Pulwama, Bajwa said that his troops were ready to go to ""any extent"" to ""help Kashmiris"".

Thorpe is telling them to be positive, look to score runs,” Boycott pointed out.“It is madness. In this situation of trying to save the match a quick fifty is not as good as staying in for three hours.

Vistara will focus on short-haul international routes while developing operations within India.",Reuters,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indian airline Vistara expects to grow its fleet size by over a third by the end of this year as it charts an aggressive expansion plan encouraged by the potential of the fast-growing domestic market, its top executive said. The company expects to end 2019 with 41 aircraft, up from 30 at present and 22 at March-end, Chief Executive Leslie Thng said on Wednesday. The carrier, a joint venture between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines Ltd, completed its first international flight to Singapore on Wednesday. The full-service airline has announced plans to add routes from India to Bangkok and Dubai as it sought to fill the gap left after the collapse of rival Jet Airways Ltd in April. “India is a market that is growing, the economy is growing. Demand for premium products will continue to grow - there is still a gap that we are trying to restore in the market,” said Thng. Vistara has hired 600 former Jet employees, including over 100 pilots, Thng told reporters in Singapore. It has taken delivery of seven Boeing 737s from Jet’s lessors and will have two more by August-end on short-term leases of 1 to 4 years. Vistara will focus on short-haul international routes this year, along with developing its operations within India, where it currently has 24 destinations. However, once Airbus A321neos and Boeing 787-9s start getting delivered next year, Vistara will have more flexibility to fly longer haul, including non-stop to Europe, the United States and Australia. While he did not confirm any destinations, Thng said Vistara was prepared to invest in purchasing slots in London. The loss-making airline has said the launch of international flights, which will give it greater scale to grow, is part of its path to profitability. The company is still posting losses, but it is moving in  the right direction towards profitability, Thng said. The company has committed to grow the fleet to about 60-70 aircraft by 2023.  “But Vistara will not stop growing. We have to continue to grow beyond 2023, we have to make another aircraft order,” Thng said. “In the second phase, which is the next five years, it is not unthinkable to say that Vistara will reach the three digit (fleet size) given the size of the Indian market, the potential of the market as well,” he added.

What is our strategic partnership? Where would we end up? How do we cooperate?” the envoy said.Obviously, the basic ingredients, the inherent factors that contribute to the relationship are there, which is essentially because both nations are strong democracies, Shringla said. “We believe in rule of law. We share the same values, ideas and principles and this is what ensures that our relationship will move forward irrespective of some of the minor speed bumps that come along the way,” he said. “We certainly see the relationship as one that should be seen in a long-term perspective and that many of these issues that may arise as you go along can be addressed and can be addressed effectively,” Shringla said.Do you know What is  Fiscal Policy in India, Expenditure Budget, Customs Duty, Reverse Repo Rate, Receipt Budget?

The multi-purpose geostationary communications satellite, which will provide mobile, streaming and video connectivity across parts of the Middle East, Africa and Europe, reached geostationary transfer orbit and then reached its target orbit and deployed as planned.SpaceX also recovered at least the fairing used to protect the cargo as it ascends to space tonight — it managed to catch one half in a giant net strung across support structures on “Ms. Tree,” a ship operated by SpaceX specifically for this purpose. The other half fell into the ocean, and SpaceX will try to collect that half as well, using a second ship it has for that purpose.SpaceX has recovered a fairing half using the net mounted on ‘Ms. Tree’ previously – it caught a fairing used in its last Falcon Heavy launch in June.SpaceX records another first for reusable rocketry by catching Falcon Heavy fairing with a boat",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/spacex-successfully-launches-twice-re-flown-falcon-9-for-amos-17-mission/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

M&M said it was only able to maintain margins due to falling commodity prices. ""Now job losses are happening in four areas Â— OEMs (original equipment makers), suppliers, dealers and unorganised sector,"" MD Pawan Goenka said.",Reuters,"MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) said on Wednesday it saw a “huge danger” of job losses in the ailing domestic auto sector, as it sought government intervention, including tax reductions to revive demand. A lending crisis among the country’s shadow banks, which fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles and 30% of passenger cars, has led to automakers, including M&M and its rivals Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, to either cut production or temporarily close plants. M&M said here in a statement it was only able to maintain margins due to falling commodity prices and the government must reduce the goods and services tax (GST) rate to spur demand. A slump in sales is also triggering massive job cuts in the sector that employs 35 million people directly and indirectly. Reuters reported on Tuesday that initial estimates suggest automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since April. “Now job losses are happening in four areas OEMs (original equipment makers), suppliers, dealers and unorganised sector,” Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters in Mumbai in a post-earnings press meet. M&M’s heavy goods segment, which makes trucks and tippers, saw its worst growth in nearly six years, the company added, as it reported a June-quarter consolidated profit that nearly halved from a year ago to 9.14 billion rupees ($129.10 million). “Given the current challenging global and domestic growth environment, a concerted policy effort will be required to prop sentiment, put a floor under consumption and revive growth,” M&M said.

6419,Nun who protested against rape-accused Bishop sacked for 'lifestyle',"Sister Lucy Kalappura, who protested against rape-accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal last year, was dismissed from Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC) in Kerala. The FCC said Kalappura didn't show remorse and failed to give a satisfactory explanation for her lifestyle. She was earlier given show cause notices for allegedly breaking her vows by writing poems, learning to drive, and buying a car.",The News Minute,"She wrote and published her poems, learnt how to drive, bought a car and even supported the protests against rape accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal. These are Sister Lucy Kalappura’s crimes according to the Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC), for which she has been dismissed from the congregation on Monday.Superior General of FCC, Ann Joseph, issued the letter, dated August 5, to Sister Lucy, stating that she “did not show the needed remorse and you failed to give a satisfactory explanation for your lifestyle in violation of the proper law of the FCC”.The General Council, which was held on 11 May 2019, unanimously voted to dismiss her from the FCC. This decree was sent to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches in the Vatican through the Nunciature in New Delhi.This, according to the letter, received confirmation from the Vatican. “The Congregation for the Oriental Churches, by virtue of the faculty given to it by the Supreme Pontiff Pope Francis having considered everything seriously, has granted the confirmation, as per the request, so that the same professed one remains freed from her religious profession and other obligations and separated from her Religious Congregation, and to be considered dismissed from her religious life, and to be considered as a simple layperson the other things to be done what are to be done according to the law,” a part of the letter of confirmation from Vatican read.Sister Lucy has been given a deadline of 10 days to make recourse to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches against this decree of dismissal.“In case you accept this decree of dismissal without any recourse, as per canon law and as per the decree of confirmation, you will be freed from the obligations of the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience that you have taken in the Franciscan Clarist Congregation and you will have no more rights and duties in the Franciscan Clarist Congregation and hence, you are to leave the present community within 10 days from the reception of this communication, after having handed over your religious habit to the superior of your local community,” the letter added.Reacting to this decree, Sister Lucy told the media, “There is no fault on my part. I will not move out from the convent and I will fight against this (dismissal) legally.”Sister Lucy of Mananthavady Diocese in Wayanad was given two letters prior to this, warning her for her “lifestyle” and for challenging the Church for cornering the survivor nun in the rape case against Franco Mulakkal. Even then, she stood by what she says now, that she has not done anything wrong, but has been right.The first letter was issued in January, and the second one in February. In both letters, the Superior General pointed out that her life was “against the principles of religious life” and “against the rule and constitution of FCC”.In fact, a few days after joining the protests led by five nuns of Missionaries of Jesus in September 2018, Sister Lucy was banned from teaching the Bible and attending prayers, worship services and other activities of the parish, including offering holy communion.Publishing poems, supporting rape survivor: 'Crimes' by Sr Lucy, according to church",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/sr-lucy-who-protested-against-rape-accused-bishop-franco-expelled-her-lifestyle-106788?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

According to police, two people entered the ""Casa de Moneda"" branch and disarmed the security guard on the premises. One of the robbers then entered the vault and filled a backpack with 1,567 gold coins before escaping, police added.",Reuters,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Armed robbers broke into a Mexican government coin manufacturer on Tuesday and filled a backpack with more than $2 million worth of gold coins from a vault that had been left open, security officials said. The daylight robbery was the latest high-profile crime to hit Mexico City, where crime has increased during record lawlessness plaguing the country. Two people, one wielding a firearm, broke into a “Casa de Moneda” branch in the morning after throwing a security guard to the ground and taking his gun, Mexico City police said. One of the robbers then went to the vault, which was open, and filled a backpack with 1,567 gold coins, police said. The coins, known as “centenarios,” have a face value of 50 pesos, but trade for 31,500 pesos ($1,610) apiece, according to Mexican bank Banorte. That makes the total value of the haul at least $2.5 million. The coin was first minted in 1921 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Mexico’s independence from Spain, according to the central bank. Production was suspended in 1931, but the coin was re-minted beginning in 1943 due to demand for gold coins.  One side bears Mexico’s coat of arms, with an eagle perched atop a cactus, and the other features the capital’s iconic Angel of Independence monument backed by the majestic Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl volcanoes. The coins, 37 mm (1.46 inches) in diameter, have a gold fineness of 0.900, or 90% purity. The same Casa de Moneda branch was also broken into last year while the building was being renovated, according to Mexican media. Mexico is suffering from record murder levels that have made the capital, long regarded as a relatively safe haven, increasingly prone to violent crime.

""Uber has not found its product-market fit in India yet,"" Parameswaran also said.",Entrackr,"After cabs, autos, and bikes, Uber will be starting an air-conditioned bus service in India in a bid to increase its user base through the introduction of public transit solutions in the country. The San Francisco-based company’s India and Southeast Asia head Pradeep Parameswaran said that it’s finalising the new product and will be launching the service within 12 months in the country on the similar lines of its pilots that are currently operational in Latin America and Middle Eastern markets of Cairo and Mexico City.Uber will run air-conditioned buses on pre-identified routes with heavy commuter traffic, focussing on business centers and educational campuses in mind. The users will be able to book a seat on the bus and will be matched with riders going in the same direction.Launched 6 years ago in India, Uber managed to capture market share by shelling out huge discounts on rides early on that got the Indian commuter hooked. But that sheen veered off as the prices came back to a somewhat operational level.According to Parameswaran, a lot of Indian commuters would spend money traveling in air-conditioned cabs twice a day, although the demand for cabs has been increasing with a growing economy and rising per capita income, a large chunk of the Indian consumer would still prefer public transit service. 

Understanding the need of users, Uber would be looking to tap a market that has been run by primarily chartered bus services and startups such as Shuttl and ZipGo which provide commuter shuttle services in India. 

Shuttl which has already raised total funding of around $48.9 million, currently runs over 1,300 buses in five Indian cities. It runs on a subscription model with a monthly price of around Rs 2,500 and claims to cater more than 65,000 customers each day. 
Meanwhile, ZipGo has been on the verge of shutdown as it didn’t receive proposed Rs 300 crore funding from Essel Group.This is not the first time a major mobility player forayed into the public transit market. Ola used to operate its own service named “ Shuttle” in the regions of Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai. Launched in 2015, the service was put to rest by the company due to “ rebalancing” of its mobility portfolio and to focus on Ola Electric and Ola Autos.The development was reported by Moneycontrol.",https://entrackr.com/2019/08/uber-bus-services-india/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Distorting results for political purposes would harm our business and go against our mission of providing helpful content to all of our users.”Conservative Google employees have claimed that Cernekee led conversations within the company tied to alt-right beliefs — claims he has since denied. “These are false and baseless smears from a jealous and vindictive ex-colleague,” the former Google engineer said in a statement. “I have always supported free speech and opposed white nationalism.”Cernekee says he was fired from the company for his conservative views.

6469,"Upcoming iOS update may restrict FB, WhatsApp voice calling","Apple reportedly plans to restrict how apps implement internet voice call, which may directly affect apps including Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp. The Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) functionality can currently enable the collection of data while running in the background, as per reports. ""We're in conversations with Apple on how best to address,"" Facebook said on the upcoming iOS update.",Engadget,"A change coming in iOS 13 could force Facebook to change Messenger and WhatsApp. As The Information reports, Apple will no longer allow these apps to run Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) in the background when it's not in use. At the moment, apps like Messenger and WhatsApp run VOIP continuously in order to connect calls faster, but doing so could also allow them to do other things, like collect user data. According to The Information, Facebook may have to redesign its messaging apps in order to comply.The change could have the biggest impact on WhatsApp, which allegedly uses VOIP to enable end-to-end encryption. But Facebook isn't alone. Other messaging app developers use VOIP to keep their apps running in the background, and they'll have to adapt to these changes, too. The update will be part of the September iOS 13 release, but developers have until April 2020 to comply.In a statement provided to The Information, a Facebook spokesperson said:""The changes to the upcoming iOS releases are not insignificant, but we are in conversations with Apple on how best to address. To be clear—we are using the PushKit VoIP API to deliver a world-class, private messaging experience, not for the purpose of collecting data.""When Apple first announced the change at its Worldwide Developers Conference, it said doing so would help it protect privacy and improve the performance of its devices. But some say the change is a way for Apple to challenge Messenger, which competes with iMessage.

""We're communal, because we want to abolish the Article 370...Mr Speaker, we're communal, because we want the voices of the Kashmiri refugees to be heard,"" she had said.",India.com,"New Delhi: Fiery, feisty and indefatigable, former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who died on Tuesday, was a leader who fit many roles in her long political leader. She might be remembered best for giving an all-new dimension to the role of foreign minister by being proactive in reaching out to Indians in distress in foreign lands.But looking back, it was equally important to have contested against Sonia Gandhi in Bellary on the Congress leader’s electoral debut in what was billed as a ‘videshi bahu’ versus ‘bharatiya nari’ contest. Bellary was then a Congress safe seat and for the BJP it was important to fight against the then new Congress president because the latter’s foreign origin was an important political issue at the time.Advertisement

            Her brief tenure as Delhi chief minister was important too, for she broke a glass ceiling as the first woman chief minister of the state. That was about as important as being the youngest cabinet minister at 25 years in the Haryana cabinet in 1977.Her proximity to Bharatiya Janata Party stalwart L.K. Advani was what led to her rise. She was one of the four Advani acolytes who came to be known as the D4, the four powerful leaders from Delhi who pretty much dominated the party at the time: Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Ananth Kumar and M. Venkaiah Naidu.It was because of the power that they wielded that two of the D4 came to occupy top positions in the party structure when the BJP was in opposition during UPA rule — Sushma Swaraj was leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha and Arun Jaitley was leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha.Being outspoken and clear-headed got her into the headlines. What perhaps contributed to that was her confidence in herself — and that she was never afraid to walk alone. Perhaps that was why she allowed media persons to walk up to her and ask questions.For her supporters, there might have been mixed feelings about some of the controversies surrounding her — like facilitating the foreign travel documents of former cricket administrator Lalit Modi in 2011 and dancing at Gandhi Samadhi in Rajghat while staging a protest. Her explanations, forceful though they were, had appeared less than fully convincing.She got into a spot of bother when a photograph of her apparently blessing the controversial Bellary brothers appeared in the media. Behind the damage limitation exercise that followed were rumours of her face-off with a prominent party leader because she thought she was taking the fall for someone else’s association with the Bellary duo — that while the BJP leader had backed them, she was being made to look poorly in public because of the photograph. Party insiders say that even though she had moved on from the episode, she never forgave the BJP leader.Sushma Swaraj might not have been in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s inner circle but she held her own, often winning praise from the Prime Minister for her role as External Affairs Minister. Delhi’s insidious grapevine had suggested that she was asked to contest for the Lok Sabha this year but she declined, citing health reasons. The truth about that might never be made public.Women politicians, even the fiery among them, often come to be regarded as mother figures in their later years. Sushma Swaraj was no exception and her role as External Affairs Minister endorsed this image of her. But, behind that amiable exterior was a politician of immense caliber and top grade firepower. Indeed, those who saw her for the first time were often surprised that she was not quite tall.Hours before she passed away, Sushma Swaraj had tweeted her congratulations to the Prime Minister and Home Minister for the decision on Article 370. Here too, she had a role to play — through her speech in the Lok Sabha in 1996 when she spoke on the BJP’s plan to remove Article 370, which is in the party’s core agenda, along with a uniform civil code and building a Ram temple at Ayodhya.For a committed BJP leader, it is likely that she would have been at peace following the government’s decision on the contentious constitutional provision.",https://www.india.com/news/india/sushma-swaraj-a-fiery-leader-and-a-mother-figure-3738651/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6482,Delhi govt rejects AB InBevÂ’s plea to temporarily lift ban: Report,The Delhi government reportedly rejected a plea by world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev to temporarily lift a three-year ban while they hear the brewer's appeal. AB InBev has been barred from selling its products in Delhi for allegedly evading local taxes. An investigation revealed that AB InBev acquired SABMiller used duplicate barcodes on beer bottles supplied to retailers in 2016.,Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Authorities in New Delhi have rejected a plea by Anheuser-Busch InBev to temporarily lift a 3-year ban while it hears the global brewer’s appeal, a senior government source told Reuters. AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, has been barred from selling its products in the critical New Delhi market for allegedly evading local taxes, Reuters reported last week. The company has denied the allegations. A three-year investigation by authorities in India’s capital found that SABMiller - acquired by AB InBev in 2016 for around $100 billion - used duplicate barcodes on beer bottles supplied to retailers that year, allowing it to pay lower levies. AB InBev has appealed against the ban to the Commissioner of Excise in the Delhi city government, two government sources with direct knowledge said. The ban order was passed by a deputy commissioner of the division. While the company’s appeal is still under consideration, AB InBev also filed a separate plea with the Commissioner for putting the ban order on hold pending appeal, but that request was turned down, one of the government sources said on Tuesday. “The (ban) order was detailed, there was no ground to give an interim stay,” said the official, who declined to be named as the decision is not public. AB InBev, which counts popular beer brands such as Budweiser, Hoegaarden and Stella Artois in its portfolio, said the city’s allegations dated back to 2016 before its takeover of SABMiller and it looked forward to receiving a “fair hearing”. “We are strongly committed to operating with integrity and high ethical standards and making the City of Delhi part of our larger growth story in India,” it said in a statement. In recent weeks, AB InBev’s senior executives, including vice president for legal & corporate affairs for South Asia, John K. Johnson, appeared before the Delhi officials who are hearing the company’s appeal, the second government source and a third person familiar with the matter said. AB InBev is the second biggest player in India’s $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5 percent market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. The New Delhi case was sparked by a random inspection of beer bottles at a drinking spot in an upmarket New Delhi neighbourhood in 2016. The order, issued on July 16, said it was “reasonable to believe” same barcodes were duplicated multiple times and supplied to various retail vendors in Delhi, amounting to the offence of selling non-duty paid liquor.

6483,Vivendi in talks with Tencent to sell 10% stake of Universal Music,French conglomerate Vivendi announced on Tuesday that it is in talks with Chinese tech group Tencent to sell a 10% stake of Universal Music Group. The deal would give UMG a preliminary equity valuation of $33.6 billion and Tencent a one-year option to purchase another 10% stake on the same terms. The potential sale would cost Tencent $3.36 billion.,Reuters,"PARIS/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd is in talks to buy up to 20% of Universal Music Group (UMG) from Vivendi SA, valuing the music label of Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and the Beatles at around 30 billion euros ($34 billion), as both firms look to expand in a recovering global music market. While at a preliminary stage, the discussions highlight Tencent’s role as gatekeeper to China’s growing but tightly controlled music market and its interest in global expansion. It also highlights Universal’s ambition in new markets and embrace of online streaming. Global music-streaming retail sales are expected to more than double to $45.3 billion by 2026 from $19.6 billion in 2018, UK-based media analysis firm Midea predicts. French media group Vivendi, controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, said on Tuesday that Tencent would first buy 10% of Universal, the world’s biggest music label ahead of Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music and home to artists also including Taylor Swift, Drake and Kendrick Lamar. Tencent, which already holds stakes in the world’s most popular music streaming service, Sweden’s Spotify, India’s Gaana, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, and owns Asian streaming app Joox, would also have an option to buy a further 10% of Universal. Vivendi shares closed 4% higher at 24.93 euros as analysts welcomed progress on the sale of a stake in Universal.  “The valuation looks good, and the progress made on the UMG deal is also positive,” said Gregory Moore, fund manager at Keren Finance, which owns Vivendi shares. Both groups are also “considering areas of strategic commercial cooperation,” Vivendi said, raising questions among analysts over the scope of the talks. Universal rivals Sony Music and Warner Music also have investments in Tencent Music Entertainment Group. Jerry Dellis, an analyst at Jefferies, also said in a note to clients that U.S. political opposition to Chinese investment in what could be considered a strategic asset could obstruct a deal. A deal with Tencent could boost Universal’s presence and  build on a partnership struck two years ago, under which Tencent can license Universal’s music for distribution over its streaming platforms.   Tencent’s music unit also owns exclusive rights to sub-license Universal’s content to other content providers in China. They worked together to build Abbey Road Studios, China, a recording studio named after the Beatles’ studio in London.  Tencent appears to be responding in part to slowing growth at home, wrote MIDiA analyst Mark Mulligan, who added that a deal would give Tencent investments in both music distribution and music rights holding, “backing both horses” in the music industry’s financial race. Tencent also faces stiff competition from China’s privately held ByteDance, whose popular social media, video sharing and music sites include Toutiao and TikTok.  Universal still generates the bulk of its revenue out of the North America and Europe, which together represented more than three-quarters of the division’s recorded music sales in the first half, while Asia produced only 14%. Recorded music revenue, however, grew twice as fast in Asia at 35% as in Europe at 15% over the period and TME boasted 654 million monthly active users on its platforms at the end of the first quarter.  Spotify’s monthly active users, which include its ad-supported free version, amounted to 232 million at end of June.  After a cash-burning competition among companies to snap up music rights, China’s content regulator last year demanded music streaming sites share 99% of their rights reserve with each other. Unlike Western players such as Sweden’s Spotify, Tencent Music generates only a fraction of revenue from music subscription packages, and instead relies heavily on services popular in China such as online karaoke and live streaming.  Universal and Tencent both hold shares in Spotify, the world’s biggest music streaming platform which has a market capitalisation of about $27 billion, while the Swedish firm is a stakeholder in Tencent Music. Tencent said at the time of its last earnings that it was adding more music behind a paywall, including popular Taiwanese singer Jay Chou, to raise revenue. But it said it might take time before Chinese users adapt to this relatively new approach. Tencent shares closed 1% lower in Hong Kong and the company declined to comment. Vivendi Chief Executive Arnaud de Puyfontaine said last month that proceeds of the sale of up to 50% of Universal would be used for bolt-on acquisitions and share buybacks.  The group first said it would sell part of Universal a year ago but had made little progress until announcing last month that it had selected investment banks to start a formal sale, which should be finalised by the start of 2020. Vivendi also said it was continuing the process to sell further minority stakes in Universal to other partners.

6484,HSBC to pay $336 million for Belgian tax fraud settlement,"HSBC's Swiss private banking arm agreed to pay nearly $336 million to settle a 2014 Belgian tax fraud case, prosecutors said on Tuesday. HSBC was charged with 'serious and organised tax frauds, money laundering and illegal use of financial intermediaries'. The scheme could have benefited over thousand clients and cost the Belgian authorities 'hundreds of millions of euros', prosecutors alleged.",Reuters,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - HSBC’s (HSBA.L) Swiss private banking arm has agreed to pay nearly 300 million euros ($336 million) to settle a tax fraud case in Belgium, Belgian prosecutors said on Tuesday, the latest blow for the Alpine state’s banking sector from the EU. The settlement comes after a French court in February ordered UBS (UBSG.S), another Swiss lender, to pay 4.5 billion euros in penalties for illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. UBS, which is under investigation in Belgium for a similar case, denies the charges. Swiss banks have been exposed to such legal challenges since 2004, when Bern agreed to apply a European Union tax on the savings income of its lenders’ EU clients. The Belgian prosecutors said in a statement that HSBC was “charged by a prosecutor in 2014 for serious and organized tax fraud, forgery and falsification of records, money-laundering and illegal use of financial intermediaries.” They alleged that HSBC helped and encouraged the avoidance of the EU savings tax by creating off-shore companies in Panama and other tax havens in the Caribbean for wealthy Belgian clients “with no other purpose but to hide money”. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. The prosecutors also said that the bank had made and committed to a significant overhaul of its practices to counter financial crime risks following the allegations. European Union governments have stepped up their pressure on banks and tax havens in recent years after a string of media revelations, including of the so-called Panama Papers, exposed tax avoidance and evasion schemes that helped the wealthy to avoid paying taxes in the bloc.     The Belgian prosecutors said that under the settlement, which needs to be endorsed by Belgian judges, HSBC had agreed to pay 294.4 million euros to the Belgian state for losses in tax revenues caused by the alleged illegal activities carried out by the bank since 2013. The prosecutors estimated that money transferred to these financial vehicles could amount to several billions of dollars. More than a thousand Belgian taxpayers could have used the illegal schemes set up by HSBC, prosecutors said, which also said the bank was mostly serving clients active in the Antwerp diamond business. In addition to the tax fraud, the prosecutors’ statement said part of the illegal transfers could have involved money laundering without providing further details.

6536,"NSE, SGX get approval for joint derivatives project in GIFT City","NSE and Singapore Exchange (SGX) said they have received regulatory approvals for their international financial centre in Gujarat's GIFT City. The proposed NSE International Financial Service Centre (IFSC)-SGX Connect aims to bring together the trading of Nifty products in GIFT City and create a larger pool of liquidity, they said. It is expected to be operational before 2020-end.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) have been given the go-ahead for a planned collaboration in trading stock index-based products from an international financial centre being developed in western India. The two said on Tuesday they had won regulatory approval for their plan, which has been under discussion for months and which envisages bringing trading of the SGX’s Nifty futures contract, based on the NSE’s Nifty 50 index, to the new centre. They hope this will create a larger pool of liquidity for the product, as well as boosting activity at the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT), an initiative led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his home state. The collaboration remains subject to further approvals from relevant local authorities, the exchanges said, adding they were also working to resolve related arbitration proceedings. The two exchanges have been locked in a dispute after India’s three main bourses unexpectedly announced in February last year that they would stop licensing their indexes to foreign bourses from August. An Indian court last May referred the dispute to an arbitrator, asking SGX to continue listing and trading SGX Nifty contracts beyond August while barring it from offering proposed new products until a final decision.     NSE and SGX said they would work to have their proposed NSE International Financial Service Centre (IFSC)-SGX Connect project at GIFT operational before the end of 2020, subject to members’ readiness and receiving relevant approvals. Vikram Limaye, managing director and chief executive of NSE, said he hoped all SGX Nifty futures volumes would ultimately move to GIFT IFSC. “The objective is to make GIFT City the hub of all India access products,” Limaye said. “If we are able to successfully transition the SGX Nifty contract, I see no reason why all India access products can’t be transitioned to GIFT City.” The Indian government has been trying to lure foreign investors to GIFT City, which offers close to zero tax, dollar contracts, and top-notch infrastructure. Still, daily trading volumes have been a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars on the country’s two main stock exchanges.  SGX Nifty futures in Singapore have daily average volumes of $1.8 billion, dwarfing volumes on NSE’s international exchange at GIFT.  Over the past two decades, SGX has become the most popular market for foreign investors to bet on Indian equity indexes, with Nifty 50 futures tracking the NSE’s main index.

UrbanClap recorded over a 90% hike in its valuation between the two rounds.",Entrackr,"UrbanClap has surprised everyone when it announced $75 million Series E round from Tiger Global last week. Why? Because, it had just raised $50 million worth Series D round eight months ago, and unlike other consumer internet companies, the firm was not in dire need of capital as it doesn’t face an immense burn.And to top it with another surprise, the home service marketplace with this round has placed itself on the Soonicorn list.While the Gurugram-based company was valued to the tune of $480 million (post-money) after Series D round, it has recorded over 94.37 % hike in its marketcap with the latest round led by Tiger Global.According to RoC filings, UrbanClap is valued at about $933 million after the series E round.

Tiger Global invested $20.7 million for 50 equity shares and 12,327 Series E CCPS, reveals filings. VY Capital acquired 1,375 CCPS for $2.3 million while Steadview along with its subsidiary ABG capital invested $11.5 million for a total of 6,876 Series E CCPS in the company.The post-money valuation of UrbanClap after Series E round has catapulted the company closer to become a Unicorn. If we factor in the valuation of UrbanClap in its Series C round, the company’s valuation jumped to 4.66X in just two years. It was valued $200 million when it raised $21 million in July 2017.UrbanClap leaves CureFit, Practo, Dailyhunt, Firstcry and several others behind who are in a league to be valued over $1 billion. Importantly, the company would be the first and possibly also the last Unicorn from the home service space in the near future.Besides raising capital from institutional investors, UrbanClap had also managed to raise money from bluechip investors including Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy and former Flipkart CTO and CPO Mekin Maheshwari.UrbanClap currently has more than 20,000 individual service professionals (ISPs) on its platform across categories such as beauty, spa, cleaning, plumbing, carpentry, appliance servicing & repair, and painting.

6540,"World's thinnest gold, million times thinner than fingernail, created","Scientists at the University of Leeds, England have created the world's thinnest form of unsupported gold which is just two atoms thick and one million times thinner than a human fingernail. The researchers measured the thickness of the gold to be 0.47 nanometres. The material could have wide-scale applications in the medical device and electronics industries.",Engadget,"Scientists have created the world's thinnest gold. At just two atoms thick, the material is one million times thinner than a human fingernail, which is big news for the tech industry. Gold is already used in a range of applications such as engineering, aerospace, as well as in medicine -- gold nanaoparticles play a significant role in cancer treatment, for example -- but in a ""2D"" form it has the potential to be used even more efficiently.The flakes are flexible, which means they could be used in bendable screens, electronic inks and transparent conducting displays, plus tests indicate that the material is 10 times more efficient as a catalytic substrate than the currently used gold nanoparticles. This means it could greatly increase the speed of medical diagnostic tests, as well as the efficiency of water purification systems. Or, manufacturers could achieve existing results but with a smaller amount of gold, which has obvious economic advantages.However, the invention has been billed a ""landmark achievement"" by researchers at the University of Leeds because it also sheds more light on the creation of 2D materials altogether. According to the team, the method used to create the gold ""could innovate nanomaterial manufacturing,"" and the researchers are now focusing on ways to scale up the process.Graphene, for example, was the much-lauded poster child of 2D materials when it was created in 2004, but has faced a number of hurdles in large-scale use. According to Professor Stephen Evens, who supervised the research, the fabrication of graphene was significant, but ""The translation of any new material into working products can take a long time and you can't force it to do everything you might like to.""With 2D gold, however, its potential is much clearer. ""I think with 2-D gold we have got some very definite ideas about where it could be used, particularly in catalytic reactions and enzymatic reactions,"" said Evans. ""We know it will be more effective than existing technologies—so we have something that we believe people will be interested in developing with us.""",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/06/researchers-create-2d-gold-a-million-times-thinner-than-a-fing/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
