Apple  is warning users of a bug in iOS 13 and iPadOS involving third-party keyboards.
In a brief advisory posted Tuesday, the tech giant said the bug impacts third-party keyboards which have the ability to request “full access” permissions.
iOS 13 was released last week. Both iOS 13.1 and iPadOS 13.1, the new software version for iPads, are out today.
Third-party keyboards can either run as standalone, or with “full access” they can talk to other apps or get internet access for additional features, like spell check. But “full access” also allows the keyboard maker to capture to its servers keystroke data or anything you type — like emails, messages or passwords.
This bug, however, may allow third-party keyboards to gain full access permissions — even if it was not approved.
Apple didn’t say much more about the problem. A spokesperson did not comment beyond the advisory. But the advisory said that the bug doesn’t affect iOS’ in-built keyboard.
Update on Sept. 27: iOS 13.1.1 and iPadOS 13.1.1, released Friday, fixes the keyboard issue, according to an updated security advisory. Apple credited its own staff for discovering the keyboard-related logic vulnerability.
iOS, iPadOS and tvOS 13.1 updates are now available

TechCircle
TechCircle brings you a round-up of technology investments and M&A deals reported from across newsrooms.
Rebel Foods
Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick is in talks to pick up a minority stake in Pune-based multi-brand cloud kitchen player Rebel Foods, earlier known as Faasos, multiple media reports said.
After exiting Uber in 2017 as its CEO, Kalanick took over real estate company City Storage Systems, which is making the investment in Rebel Foods.
The investment is part of the ongoing $125 million funding round for Rebel, the reports said.
Rebel Foods, founded by Jaydeep Barman and Kallol Banerjee, operates brands like Behrouz Biryani, Oven Story, Faasos, The Good Bowl and Sweet Truth, which are available across food delivery platforms like Zomato and Swiggy.
Last month, Rebel Foods was in talks to raise $76 million in Series D from Coatue Management, a technology focussed hedge fund headquartered in California and other investors.
OYO
Gurugram-based OYO Hotels & Homes is looking to raise $750 million to $1 billion in fresh funds to infuse in its parent company Oravel Stays, according to multiple media reports.
Reports said Japan-based SoftBank Group is expected to lead the funding round.
The valuation of OYO is expected to reach $13.5 billion-$15 billion post-funding and the company will use the funds for diversification and operation of its five-star and luxury properties across the world.
OYO was already in talks with financial institutions to borrow $200 million to buy premium hotels in the United States.
The company also proposed to buyback shares worth $1.5 billion from early investors this month.
It recently announced its presence in 60 US cities with over 100 hotels.

The Financial Express
Founded in 2013 with a single hotel, OYO Hotels & Homes has been on an expansion mode widening its footprint to 80 countries. Earlier this year, founder and group CEO Ritesh Agarwal made news for buying back shares worth $2 billion from existing investors. Agarwal talks to FE’s Asmita Dey about company’s financials and focus areas. Edited excerpts:
It has been a while since the OYO-Airbnb deal has been announced. How has the collaboration shaped up? What opportunities did it create for OYO?We are happy to have Airbnb as an investor and our partner. Airbnb’s strong global footprints and access to local communities open up new opportunities for OYO Hotels & Homes to strengthen and grow. Thousands of OYO’s vacation homes across the globe can now be listed on Airbnb.
How has FY19 been in terms of numbers? Were you able to notch revenues (India) of over Rs 1,400 crore as estimated? What is your revenue target for FY20?Our financial results for FY2018-19 are yet to be filed with the Registrar of Companies. However, CY2019 has been promising. We are happy to share the company has seen a 4.4 times year-on-year growth in revenue in June 2019 (vs June 2018), with over 1 million rooms under management across hotels and homes globally and over 270,000 rooms in India alone. We also had a stellar 2018 in India with more than 1,72,000 fully controlled and leased keys as at December 2018 with realised value run-rate of $1.2 billion.
By when are you eyeing profitability?We are not profitable at a group level as we have been investing in technology, talent and hotel infrastructure improvements in our buildings. The losses as a percentage of NRV (net realised value) have been on a steady and significant declining curve.
Could you shed some light on your overseas IPO plans?We are focused on our mission of making #LivingTheGoodLife a reality for over 3.2 billion middle-income people around the world. That is our focus in the foreseeable future. We don’t have any further comments.
How much cash are you burning now? Which are the most cash-heavy markets in your kitty?I would like to clarify that unlike e-commerce businesses, we do not spend a lot on customer acquisition. Our investments are mainly in three areas — capex, talent acquisition and technology.
You bought back shares worth $2 billion from Lightspeed and Sequoia? What led you to this move? How much has your stake in OYO increased to post this buyback?The company’s strong growth, improved margins, superior improvements in customer experience gave me the confidence to take this decision. The $2-billion primary and secondary management investment round is spearheaded by me with support from financial partners, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The capital will be utilised to maintain our strong market position in India and China, strengthen our footprint in southeast Asia, Middle East, growing our business in Europe and the US while creating a niche for our vacation homes business globally.
You seem to be on an international expansion spree. Which other countries are you looking to enter further in the near future? Any plans to raise further funds to propel your foreign foray?Currently, we have over 23,000 hotels and 125,000 vacation homes across 800 cities in 80 countries globally. There are many countries which are still on the drawing board and we are evaluating the business potential. At the moment, we are continuing to grow our footprints in SEA, ME, Europe and the USA. We have a healthy and strong balance sheet and are committed to continue making forward-looking investments. We have nothing further to announce at the moment.

The Indian startup ecosystem has seen several high profile cases of trademark infringement in the past two years. Right from Flipkart, to Paytm, Bigbasket, and EaseMyTrip, these firms have been dragged to court either for running a private label or products with a similar brand name to others.
While the companies above have managed to settle their respective cases, another case of trademark infringement has been registered in Delhi High Court, where two leading players in the merchant UPI ecosystem are at loggerheads.
According to a TOI report, PhonePe has accused BharatPe of illegal usage of ‘Pe’ as a suffix in its app in English as well as in Hindi.
Claiming trademark rights over the name, PhonePe has also sought an injunction order in a lawsuit against BharatPe. In this case, senior advocate Kapil Sibal’s son Amit Sibal, who is representing PhonePe, demanded an injunction restraining infringement of trademark, passing off, and damages.
However, the court did not grant an injunction on PhonePe’s original appeal. The matter will be heard on October 9.
This is not the first instance where both companies are locking horn against each other. Previously, PhonePe had sent legal notice to Sequoia-backed company over the logo.
According to PhonePe, protection of its brand, which is valued over $7 billion, is utmost important. BharatPe has not released any official statement on the matter.
Since the matter is sub judice, any assumption regarding the case would be unfair. 
A year-old startup, BharatPe has emerged as one of the fastest-growing fintech company focusing on offline merchants and retailers, a territory where PhonePe and Paytm have sheer domination. The Ashneer Grover-led company does around 20 million peer-to-merchant transactions per month and targeting 30 million transactions every month by Diwali.

   New Delhi: Automated or driverless cars might be a distant dream for Indians. On Tuesday, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said driverless cars will not be allowed in India because the government will not promote any technology that comes at the cost of jobs.

Self driving cars require minimal or no human intervention.

“Several big personalities from the country met me and said they want to bring driverless vehicles to India. I clearly told them that till I am there, I shall not allow driverless cars in India. I was asked whether I oppose new technology. I said not at all," PTI reported Gadkari as saying at an industry event.

The minister said India has 40 lakh drivers and there is a shortage of 25 lakh drivers. “I will not let the jobs of 1 crore people be snatched away," Gadkari was quoted as saying.

This is not that first time that Gadkari has made such a statement. Two years ago, he had said government will not allow cab aggregators make money by using driving skills.

“Cab aggregators like Ola and Uber are making money by using our driving skills. If cab aggregators think they can make more money by introducing technology like driverless cars and render people unemployed, the government is not going to allow it," he had said.

A KPMG study ranked Netherlands as a country most ready to support driverless cars, followed by Singapore and US. India ranks 20. According to the study, the common factors of most countries adopting driverless cars are government support, great infrastructure, technology and innovation, and consumer acceptance .

“Given the overall socio-economic benefits of autonomous transport and the strong entrepreneurial ecosystem, India could become an important AV (autonomous vehicle) market in the long term. But at present, on technology and innovation it scores minimally for lack of patents and investments and low usage of electric cars," the report said.

RamanSat 2, a miniature satellite made by Aabhaas Sikka, a 17-year-old student, was successfully launched by NASA. The satellite, which measures 4 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm, was developed by Sikka, during his internship with SPACE-India, an organisation working in the field of astronomy, space education and technology. SPACE-India also provides the necessary training and guidance to young innovators.

RamanSat 2 was developed with help from Sachin Bahmba, Founder and CMD of SPACE Group, along with the company’s research team.

From Left to right: Vivek Srivastava, Vikrant Narang, Sachin Bahmba, Aabhaas Sikka.
The miniature satellite is carrying state-of-the-art equipment, which will measure the radiation from the sun and space. The experiment intends to make exploration of space safer for humans and satellites.

It is significant as India is preparing to send astronauts into space in its first human space flight mission Gaganyaan in 2022.

Speaking on the same, Bahmba said,

The idea to develop the satellite came at a time when earlier this year, Idoodleedu Inc., a US-based firm working in partnership with NASA, announced an international competition, ‘Cubes in Space.’

The competition provided an opportunity for students to build their experiments, which are then flown to space. Out of the 350 experiment proposals submitted by the participants, 160 were selected to be flown by NASA. This included two experiment proposals submitted by SPACE-India.

RamanSat 2 follows the success of Kalam Sat, named after former Indian President APJ Abdul Kalam, and built by an Indian high school team from Chennai, that participated in the same programme in 2017.

Global Cloud Xchange on Tuesday said that Bill Barney has stepped down as CEO of Reliance Communications to focus full time at the helm of GCX during its corporate restructuring process.

“GCX today announced that Bill Barney, CEO of Reliance Communications and Chairman and CEO of Global Cloud Xchange has resigned his RCOM role to focus full time at the helm of GCX during its corporate restructuring process,” GCX said in a statement posted on its website.
On September 16, the GCX had said that it has initiated voluntary, pre-packaged Chapter 11 restructuring with support from over 75 per cent of lenders. In the statement on Tuesday, Barney said: “With GCX’s recent voluntary Chapter 11 filing, it will be in the best interest of both RCOM and GCX for me to step down at this time to focus on GCX restructuring”.
“Upon emergence from this process, GCX expects to be well-positioned to aggressively pursue our business plan independent of the overhang caused by our corporate parent’s challenges,” Barney added.

TechCrunch
WeWork’s co-founder and chief executive officer Adam Neumann  has stepped down as CEO and will serve as non-executive chairman of the board, the company confirmed in a press release Tuesday following a report from The Wall Street Journal. WeWork’s vice chairman Sebastian Gunningham and the company’s president and chief operating officer Artie Minson will serve as co-CEOs.
The eclectic executive has faced increasing pressure to relinquish his throne after another report from the WSJ highlighted his drug use and desires to become Israel’s prime minister, among other strange behaviors.
“As co-founder of WeWork, I am so proud of this team and the incredible company that we have built over the last decade,” Neumann said in a statement. “Our global platform now spans 111 cities in 29 countries, serving more than 527,000 members each day. While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive. Thank you to my colleagues, our members, our landlord partners, and our investors for continuing to believe in this great business.”
Neumann’s wife and WeWork co-founder Rebekah Neumann is said to have stepped down from her role as well. Rebekah has had several titles over the years, including chief impact officer, chief brand officer and most recently, co-founder and CEO of WeGrow, WeWork’s “conscious entrepreneurial school.”
SoftBank, the Japanese investor that has funneled billions into the star co-working business, is said to have encouraged — rather, enforced — Neumann’s reported transition out of the CEO role ahead of the company’s anticipated initial public offering. Per the WSJ, moving to the chairman seat would “allow [Neumann] to stay at the company he built into one of the country’s most valuable startups, but inject fresh leadership to pursue an IPO that would bring We the cash it needs to keep up its torrid growth.”
WeWork revealed its unusual IPO prospectus last month after raising more than $8 billion in equity and debt funding. The New York-based company had been valued at a whopping $47 billion, thanks largely to SoftBank’s repeated investments despite financials that show losses of nearly $1 billion in the six months ending June 30.
Wall Street investors were skeptical of the eye-popping valuation, leading to reports WeWork would seek a valuation of as low as $15 billion instead, a magnificent defeat for one of the most valuable private companies in the world. Ultimately, WeWork delayed its float altogether, claiming it planned to go public “by the end of the year.”
In additional efforts to appease Wall Street, WeWork amended its S-1 filing to include the appointment of an independent lead director and its first female board member, Frances Frei. On top of that, the company decreased the strength of Class B and Class C shares so Neumann would not have 20 times the voting power of other shareholders, and removed Neumann’s wife from succession planning at the company.
According to the latest news, Neumann’s voting shares will be reduced from 10:1 to 3:1.
Meanwhile, WeWork is working with bankers to reduce the cost of its money-losing operation, with a new report from The Information stating the business may cut as many as 5,000 roles, or one-third of its entire workforce.
The WeWork IPO saga draws many parallels to Uber’s pre-IPO struggles. Both companies were led, for years, by outspoken executives, Neumann and Travis Kalanick, respectively. Both men were ousted, in essence, by frustrated board members who were concerned at the potential outcome of multi-billion-dollar IPOs.
Given WeWork’s struggle to complete a public listing and Uber’s disappointing performance on the public markets, perhaps private market investors will realize Silicon Valley’s pixie dust doesn’t carry the same weight on Wall Street.
As Adam Neumann reportedly faces pressure to step down; it’s looking like a fight for life between WeWork and SoftBank

US-Indian comedian Hasan Minhaj appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers Monday night 23 September to discuss him being denied entry to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston, Texas.
Hasan, who hosts Netflix’s popular political comedy show Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj, was allegedly told by the organizers that his comments on PM Modi were the reason for him being shut out from covering the event.
Watch the video of Hasan recounting the entire situation below.

Hasan also pointed out that the irony while he was ‘blacklisted’ and forced to watch the program online, the event in fact mentioned his name while honouring prominent Indian Americans. He managed to captured a screen where his picture was used in the event alongside other Indian American comedians Aziz Ansari and Mindy Kaling.
About 50,000 people of the Indian-American community attended the event at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on Sunday, 22 September, that was jointly addressed by the Indian prime minister and US President Donald Trump.
Earlier, a video did the rounds on social media, in which Hasan is seen talking to a media coordinator from the press registration desk outside the venue on phone.
Hasan had received flak from Indian users on social media for his episodes on the Indian elections and the media clampdown in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370.

Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Tuesday, 24 September, reached Jammu on the second-leg of his six-day tour of Jammu and Kashmir and said the situation in the Valley is "very bad".
His three earlier bids to reach Srinagar had failed as he was turned back from the airport by the authorities.
When asked by reporters as to what was his assessment of the situation in Kashmir, Azad replied, "It is very bad."
"I do not have to say anything to media right now. I spent four days in Kashmir and arrived here to spend two more days in Jammu. After the end of the six-day tour, I will say whatever I have to say," he told reporters outside his residence in Jammu.
In response to another question about submission of his assessment report on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir to the Supreme Court, the former state chief minister said a decision on this would be taken after his return to Delhi.
Asked about detention of political leaders and curbs on political activities, Azad said, "There is no mark of freedom of speech in Jammu and Kashmir."
Azad's visit became possible after the Supreme Court on 16 September allowed him to tour the state.
A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had allowed the Congress leader to visit four districts - Srinagar, Jammu, Baramulla, Anantnag - to meet people.
The bench was informed by Azad's counsel and senior advocate A M Singhvi that the Congress leader wants to meet people and inquire about their welfare.
A senior Congress leader said Azad will restrict his visit to Jammu district alone as per the Supreme Court directive.
"He will hold meetings with party activists and will be interacting with cross-section of people to assess the situation," he said.
He said it is unfortunate that Azad had to seek the permission from the apex court to visit his home state, where majority of the mainstream political leaders have been placed under detention or house arrest since the scrapping of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two Union Territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

The speculation on MS Dhoni‘s future has been a talking point after India‘s semifinal exit from the World Cup 2019. The former India skipper has not played any international game after the ICC event in England and Wales.
While the selectors have decided to stick with Rishabh Pant, Virat Kohli has made it clear that Dhoni is on the similar page with the team management when it comes to his international cricket.
On Tuesday, Yuvraj Singh, who was part of India’s 2007 ICC World T20 and 2011 World Cup squads under Dhoni, said that the discussion around Dhoni’s future in “unfair”.

“I think it’s unfair to him. The guy (Dhoni) has done so much for Indian cricket. He has been the most successful Indian captain, so you got to give him time,” Yuvraj said on the sidelines of ‘The Sports Movement’ summit organised by India On Track in New Delhi.
Yuvraj also said that the decision to retire rests solely with Dhoni, who has been on a sabbatical for more than two months.

“He needs to decide when he wants to go out. He needs to take that call. If he wants to still play, that’s his call and we need to respect that,” added Yuvraj.
Earlier, Sunil Gavaskar had suggested that Dhoni should retire before being pushed out and urged that the team management should look beyond Dhoni.

“Nobody knows know what is in MSD’s mind. Only he can clarify what he thinks his future with Indian cricket is. But I think with him being 38 now, India should be looking ahead. Because by the time the next T20 World Cup comes around he will be 39 years old,” Sunil Gavaskar had told India Today.
“His value to the side is always going to be fantastic. Not just the runs he will score or the stumpings he will effect. But his overall presence on the field will be calming for the captain because the captain gets the benefit of his views. So that is a huge plus. But I do believe the time has come,” added Gavaskar.

Bangladesh and Afghanistan shared the trophy after the tri-nation Twenty20 international tournament final was washed out without a ball being bowled at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka on Tuesday.

Match officials declared the game abandoned at 9pm local time (1500 GMT) as the rain showed no sign of stopping — making it impossible to hold even a curtailed-over game.
TRI-NATION SERIES 2019 | LATEST NEWS 
It means hosts Bangladesh got a hand on the trophy of a Twenty20 tournament involving more than two teams for the first time in their history.
The wash-out also rounded off a mixed tournament for both teams as Bangladesh won three of their four matches in the league phase, while Afghanistan won their first two matches before losing the next two.
“Disappointing that we didn’t get any match today. It was a very important final. We didn’t play our best cricket in this tournament but leading up to the final we played some good cricket,” Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan said.
Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan hailed the fans who waited in the gallery, defying the rain and hoping for some action.
“The crowd we had today was amazing. We wanted to have a game today. I think it was incredible performance from the guys. So unlucky that we didn’t get the match today,” he said.
Afghanistan’s Rahmanullah Gurbaz was named player of the tournament for making 133 runs in four innings.
Zimbabwe were the other team of the tournament.

The BCCI's much-awaited elections have been rescheduled by a day to 23 October in the wake of assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra, Chairman of the Committee of Administrators (CoA) running Indian cricket Vinod Rai told PTI on Tuesday.
Both the states will be voting on 21 October in a single-phase elections and to ensure that voter members from the two units are not inconvenienced, the Cricket Board poll has been postponed by a day.
"The BCCI elections are on track. It's just because of the state polls, we have decided to reschedule by a day. So it will now be held on 23 October instead of 22 October. Anything else that you read anywhere will be factually incorrect," CoA chief Rai told PTI on Tuesday.
Another CoA member Diana Edulji said while she is "against any delay in conducting the BCCI elections", she understands that a day's extension is due to state polls.
"As per the Supreme Court order passed on September 20, the state units may be granted a few days' grace but BCCI elections should be on time. We may defer it by a day due to assembly elections in Maharashtra on 21st," the former India women's captain said.

Rai was happy with the outcome of the Supreme Court hearing on the Tuesday during which its petition seeking clarification on the permission granted to the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association to hold elections, was admitted.
"Today, the petition came up for hearing. The BCCI counsel was there, TNCA counsel and amicus curiae P S Narsimha was there. I am happy with the outcome," he said.
"The SC took cognisance of the fact that some state units are misinterpreting the order mischievously on 'disqualification being confined to office-bearers only'," said Rai.
"Many felt that it meant that the 70-year clause (age cap), non-Indian passport holder clause have been done away with, which is not the case," the former CAG added.

MS Dhoni has been a legendary cricketer for the Indian cricket after he made his debut at the highest level in 2004 versus Bangladesh. Around three years later, he took the mantle of leadership in the 2007 T20 World Cup and guided the team to glory, defying all the odds. Later that year, he was made the ODI captain in the tri-nation series in Australia that the Men in Blue won.
It was the same year when India crashed out of the World Cup in the West Indies after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the first round. A year later, the keeper became the Test skipper as well and ever since, Indian cricket has seen an upsurge. 12 years since his foray into international cricket, the Jharkhand-born is one of the greatest cricketers India have ever produced.

When he came into the scheme of things, India also got an answer to their problem of finding a genuine all-format keeper-batsman. Parking aside his prowess on the field, Dhoni isn’t an active participant on social media platforms, but keeps on chipping in with posts from time to time.
Recently, he posted a video where he went down the memory lane to his school days. In the video, his friend got bowled while trying to play a shot. Then the batsman hilariously claimed that it was a trial ball. Dhoni said that the childhood funda was a common phenomenon.
He captioned the video and wrote, “Wen U know what’s coming and start the camera and u get it in the nxt 1min, sorry for the bad light but it’s the lingo that’s fun trial ball, umpires decision last decision.brings back memory from school days.he wd have never accepted this ever happened if v didn’t have this video.all of us have witnessed this at some point of time in cricket.enjoy.”

Dhoni is going through a rather tough time in his career. He last played the 2019 World Cup in England and Wales. Then he took a break from the sport in order to serve the Indian Army. He missed the series versus the West Indies and South Africa. As per latest reports, he has extended his break until November and will miss the home series against Bangladesh as well.

Facebook  confirms it won’t fact check politicians’ speech or block their content if it’s newsworthy even if it violates the site’s hate-speech rules or other policies. This cementing of its policy comes from Facebook’s head of global policy and communication Nick Clegg, who gave a speech today about Facebook’s plans to prevent interference in the 2020 presidential election.
But by seeking neutrality, Facebook may become complicit in the misinformation and malevolence some politicians will use it to spread. It leaves users to fend for themselves as they try to discern fact from fiction and opinion from reality. Clegg claims the idea is for users to “judge what politicians say themselves.”
Isn’t that disgorgement of responsibility already what Facebook was doing by merely routing false news links to fact checkers and affixing their verdicts to shares of the content while still leaving it up on the site? To now say politicians can’t be fact-checked directly at all sets a critical and questionable precedent.
Facebook’s head of global policy and communications, Nick Clegg
Facebook’s head of global policy and communications, Nick Clegg
“We don’t believe, however, that it’s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician’s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,” writes Clegg, the former deputy Prime Minister of the U.K. “That’s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program . . .This means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review.”
Yes, it prevents direct censorship of politicians and leaves critique to the media. Yet it also ignores how Facebook turns any voice into a publication, amplified by engagement-seeking algorithms distributed to billions of people. Users often treat Facebook as the internet and what they see on the internet as true.
Facebook doesn’t want false news distorting voters’ decisions ahead of the 2020 elections. However, the year-old “no fact-checks” rule and three-year-old “protected newsworthy speech” rule effectively elevate whatever comes out of a politicians mouth as above consequence.
If they share a debunked link, that can be labeled as wrong and demoted, but what they say is free to proliferate and confuse people. Not even a politician’s ads are subject to fact check, so you can spread whatever lies you want on Facebook as long as you’re rich enough and running for office. Facebook only draws the line at allowing content from politicians that would cause real-world harm, or running politicians’ ads that violate its policies.
This is certainly easier operationally for Facebook. It doesn’t have to be responsible for paying in-house staff or outside fact checkers to assess politicians’ diatribes. And it won’t as often end up in the cross-hairs of elected officials claiming Facebook is biased against them.
Some could see the benefit of these rules being that Facebook could never directly censor a politician unless they directly threatened people. If speaking for themselves from their own accounts, they get what’s close to free speech.
But it ignores how politics has evolved in the post-truth era. Rather than win with facts, it’s easier just to shout lies or insults loud and frequently enough that they’re accepted at face value, rebroadcast and culturally ingrained. Sensationalism spreads further than what’s level-headed. The fact check never gets as many shares as the incendiary claim. And those with a bully pulpit can keep an iron grip on their megaphone.
Facebook may not want to be the arbiter of truth, or even be considered “media,” but it transmits falsity without question; it’s not a platform, it’s a pawn.

Trump was quoted by news agency IANS as saying, “He (PM Modi) gave a lot of his time, and for the Indian Americans it is a matter of great pride.”
Notably, the two leaders addressed a gathering of more than 50,000 Indian-Americans in Houston on Sunday.

Reuters
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a stinging rebuke to China’s trade practices on Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not accept a “bad deal” in U.S.-China trade negotiations. 
Four days after deputy U.S. and Chinese negotiators held inconclusive talks in Washington, Trump’s remarks were anything but conciliatory and emphasized the need to correct structural economic abuses at the heart of the countries’ nearly 15-month trade war. 
He said Beijing had failed to keep promises it made when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and was engaging in predatory practices that had cost millions of jobs in the United States and other countries. 
“Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale,” Trump said. 
“As far as America is concerned, those days are over.” 
Although Trump held out hope that the United States and China could still reach a trade deal, he made clear he wanted a deal that would rebalance the relationship between the two economic superpowers. 
“The American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance in our relationship with China. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial for both countries,” Trump said. “As I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal.” 
Trump also recently said he was not interested in a “partial deal” to ease tensions with China, saying that he would hold out for a “complete deal.” 
U.S. stocks gave up modest gains and fell into negative territory after Trump’s U.N. address, which some investors said marked a reversal of the more constructive tone that had surrounded the negotiations last week. [.N] 
“Trump’s comments to the U.N. were very antagonistic toward China. In the last couple of weeks there’s been optimism trade would go in a positive direction,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, an investment advisory group based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  
“It was the tone and the fact he listed out in great detail all the gripes the U.S. has with China,” Zaccarelli said. “All that trade optimism that’s been building has been sucked out of the air and replaced with pessimism.” 
Trump’s speech highlighted the plight of U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O), which has become a symbol of U.S. assertions that China fails to protect American intellectual property and steals it or forces the transfer of it. Two years ago Micron accused a Chinese state firm of stealing its chip designs. 
“Soon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China,” Trump said, “But we are seeking justice.” 
He added that the United States lost 60,000 factories and 4.2 million manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. 
“The rhetoric around China and President Trump’s speech was as harsh as we have heard,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at brokerage National Securities Corp in New York. 
China’s top official at the U.N. General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, sat silently during Trump’s remarks, showing no reaction on camera. 
Wang is due to speak on U.S.-China relations on Tuesday evening at a business event in New York. 
The tone of Trump’s speech also was at odds with some recent steps by China to meet his request for purchases of more American farm products. On Monday, Chinese importers bought about 10 shiploads of U.S. soybeans - about 600,000 tonnes. 
China’s customs commission will exclude certain amounts of U.S. soybeans, pork and other products from its retaliatory tariffs, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday. 
The purchases were made following last week’s trade talks, which both the U.S. and Chinese sides characterized as “productive.” People familiar with the trade talks said no new Chinese proposals were presented, and the countries agreed to continue minister-level talks in early October. 
In his U.N. speech, Trump also drew a link between resolving the U.S.-China trade dispute and Beijing’s treatment of Hong Kong. Washington was “carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong,” he said.”The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong’s freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life,” Trump said. Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997. 
“How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader,” Trump added. 
Trump also touched on trade with Japan in his speech, saying that he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday would “continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal.” 
It remains unclear whether the two countries will sign the deal at their bilateral meeting or whether Japanese requests for assurances that Trump won’t hit them with autos tariffs will delay the final agreement.

		             NEW DELHI :
The death toll from an earthquake that struck Pakistani Kashmir jumped to 37, officials said on Wednesday, as families mourned relatives and rescue teams sent supplies to the area.
Officials said the extent of the casualties, who included young children, emerged a day after the 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck as authorities were able to reach towns and villages around the region outside main population centres.
"We had dispatched survey teams in the entire area affected by the earthquake to collect details of the victims," Muhammad Tayyab, divisional commissioner for Mirpur, one of the worst affected areas, told Reuters, adding that around 500 people had been injured.
Tuesday's earthquake levelled homes and shops and split open roads in an area between the towns of Jhelum and Mirpur to the north, part of which is in Pakistan's portion of the disputed territory of Kashmir.
"The situation is slowly returning to normal, the level of panic is now less among the people, although an aftershock was felt at night," said Sardar Gulfaraz Khan, a police deputy inspector general.
Most of the damage happened in villages where old houses collapsed, Khan said.

"The epicentre of the earthquake was Pakistan-India border, Jammu and Kashmir region. The magnitude of the quake was 6.3 on the Richter scale. Even we felt the tremors here in the office. Tremors were felt across Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir," J.L. Gautam, Director Operation, National Center for Seismology told ANI.
The epicentre of the shallow 5.8-magnitude was near the Pakistan Occupied Kashmiri city of Mirpur, roughly 22 kilometres (14 miles) north of Jhelum in agricultural Punjab province, according to the US Geological Survey.
"The (most) damage is in areas between Jhelum and Mirpur," said the chief of Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority, Lieutenant General Mohammad Afzal.

"The quake was 10 kilometres deep and was felt in most of Punjab province, some parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The worst hit was Mirpur, Azad Kashmir," Pakistan's chief meteorologist Muhammad Riaz told AFP. District commissioner Mohammad Tayyab said eight people were killed, including three children. District police chief Irfan Saleem said more than 100 more suffered injuries. Major General Asif Ghafoor, a spokesman for the Pakistan Armed Forces, tweeted that army troops with aviation and medical support teams were dispatched.
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 on the Richter scale and a depth of 40 km hit the Pakistan-India border region at around 4:30 pm. There was no report of any loss of life or property due to the earthquake so far.
Earthquake of Magnitude:6.3, Occurred on:24-09-2019, 16:31:58 IST, Lat:32.9 N & Long: 73.7 E, Depth: 40 Km, Region: Pakistan - India (J & K ) Border region pic.twitter.com/BpyJT7kb5W
"The epicentre was near the India-Pakistan border. The closest big city to the epicentre is Rawalpindi (in Pakistan's Punjab province)," said J L Gautam, head of operations at the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) said.
"I don't think that the quake has caused any damage in Delhi but there are several villages with poor constructions, which might get damaged. We can't predict the aftershocks right now," he added.
"European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC): Earthquake of magnitude 6.1 at Richter scale strikes 173 km North West of Lahore, Pakistan," ANI reported.

Pakistan Meteorological Department's earthquake centre, however, said the earthquake measured 5.8 on the Richter scale and its depth was at 10 kilometres.
The earthquake jolted Pakistan as tremors lasted for 8-10 seconds but were felt strongly across the country, including in major cities of Islamabad, Peshawar, Rawalpindi and Lahore.
Pakistan's Meteorological Department said the epicenter of the quake was located near the mountainous city of Jehlum in the Punjab province. The tremors shook walls in Islamabad and left people standing in the streets outside.
There are reports of damage to roads and buildings from Mirpur and other areas in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Reuters reported that one person was killed and several others injured in Jhelum.

From coding software at the age of eight, becoming a part of a global annual forum for improving science in Asia, authoring a book on top 100 Indian engineering colleges, starting a consulting firm for foreign companies entering India, dropping out of college and becoming the first Indian Thiel fellow, to pivoting Oravel Stays to OYO Rooms and making it a $5 billion private enterprise, Ritesh Agarwal has come a long way. What lies ahead for him is to become the world’s largest hotel chain by continuing to stay innovative. “While one is in the process of coming up with a truly innovative solution, it is essential to keep an open mind,” Agarwal said in a tete-a-tete with Sandeep Soni. Below are the edited excerpts – part 2.
While India and China remain your biggest markets but how do you see the graph moving ahead particularly with respect to your US foray?
You are right. India and China are two of our biggest and home markets. In fact, China is bigger than India for us in terms of room count. We have over 500,000 rooms in China and more than 270,000 rooms in India. In addition to these two markets, the US is our third home market and it is the fastest scale-up for us in any market globally, with over 100 hotels in a short span of time. The US has the potential to be a large market in the future. Indonesia had a stagnant growth but has taken off in a big way. We have over 21,000 keys in Indonesia. I think as we go forward, China, India, the US and Indonesia will continue to be our biggest markets. The focus in Europe continues to be on vacation homes while we are catering to the growing demand for quality, affordable accommodations in the Middle East.
Talking of innovation, when you say you will be the world’s largest hotel company, how does the innovation look to you from the top?
While one is in the process of coming up with a truly innovative solution, it is essential to keep an open mind. One should accept failure, and be willing to learn, unlearn and relearn again. We have always believed that an overnight success story is backed by at least five years of dedicated hard work and perseverance. At OYO, we have been able to instil innovation throughout the company by inculcating the ability to make sure that the company and mission come first. This is not just true for the management but also for all OYOpreneurs.

Another way through which we instil innovation is in hiring the right leaders. We have never lost any single senior leader in the history of our company when large Indian startups have faced huge churn due to the innovative philosophy of ‘Distributed Leadership’ to expedite decision making in the company and retaining top talent from the beginning. This diversified group of leaders hold the key to our growth.
How have you deployed technology both on the supply and demand side?
Technology has always been a key differentiator for OYO. As an intersection of real estate, hospitality and technology, OYO has over 20 technological products that power various business verticals. At present, OYO offers multiple app-based solutions both for its customers, employees and asset partners including our Property Manager app for managing all daily functions of the property and Owner App for asset owners to have complete visibility of his business. Then there is OYO AGMs (key contacts for guests and hoteliers in a certain geographical area) that use Krypton for auditing OYO hotels. Our AI-based algorithms help the chain in predicting the most suited properties at the best location at the correct price for its customers. Also, our integration with AI-based bots has enabled property owners to assist customers.
Having scaled significantly both as a business and an entrepreneur, any thoughts on giving back to society?
There are causes that are dear to me personally including encouraging entrepreneurship, improving livelihoods as well as helping humanitarian rescue and relief efforts. I am only 25 now and have a long way to go personally but I am considering a few ideas that will help me make a meaningful contribution. You will soon hear about this.
From an organisational perspective, we formalised a concrete CSR program called OYO Reach that assists in several causes including installing rainwater-harvesting systems in water-deficient cities, harnessing technology and resources towards cultivating a culture of sustainability, focus on skill development, and economic opportunity creation in the cities where we operate and help to boost the local tourism.
Lastly, on a lighter note what are your marriage plans since you are probably among the most eligible bachelors of India Inc.?
(Laughs!) My mom is surely worried that the fact that I don’t have a college degree will impact my chances of finding a bride.

Times Now
New Delhi: Claiming to be the first city to implement the Street Vendors Act, 2014, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced that the city government will legalise the street vendors and hawkers and will provide them protection in the national capital.
"Delhi will become the first state to implement the Act. Under it, 28 town vending committees have been set up and a notification has been issued. The election for the committees too has been done," Kejriwal said.
The committees, each having 30 members, have 12 vendors or hawkers as their team, while rest of the members are officials, town planners, police and traffic police, and RWAs and market association, and officials from the health department he said.
Kejriwal said the MCDs and the civic bodies have been asked to conduct a survey of vendors through their respective town vending committees. After the survey is completed, street vendors will be given certificates and thereafter, licences will be issued.
"The licences will have the name of the owner, address and the place of vending, and this will ensure that they are not harassed by anyone," Kejriwal said. He said earlier street vendors were harassed and forcibly removed by police and civic bodies. "Now licences will be provided to the vendors based and it will end their extortion and harassment". He added that the Street Vending Act will not only benefit hawkers but will also help in decongesting the roads in the city.
The Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 was passed in February, 2014 to regulate street vendors in public areas and protect their rights. It was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2012 by then Union Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Kumari Selja.
Kejriwal said as part of the procedure, the MCDs will have a survey to identify the vendors and hawkers in the area and "those who were removed from any part of the city due to any rule will also be given space." The Chief Minister said the town vending committees will take the decision on the final number of vendors at any location.
"The committee will have all the power. It will identify vending and non-vending zones. The members will decide where the hawkers will be allowed. The government will not have any role," he said. Kejriwal said the vendors play an important role in society in any city. "And it will not be wrong to say they are the lifeline of Delhi."
He said developed nations have a legal way of organising these vendors. "In Delhi, they play an important role in the lifeline and economy. We buy vegetables, milk, fruits and other daily use things. But we don't have any policy to organise them. This results in so many issues."
Speaking about the issues faced by the vendors, he said the police, MCD and other local bodies harass them and extort money from them. "Different bodies have the anti-encroachment drive and the vendors have to bear the loss as their products were taken into the custody."
"After the law is implemented, they will not be harassed. We are also exploring if we can provide them with any structure as per international standards with garbage bins and solar panels for electricity. This will also uniform the markets and make them beautiful as well. They will also not hamper the traffic if their locations are fixed. "
He said although there is no estimate of the number but close to five lakh vendors are in the city. "We are expecting the survey to start in next 10-15 days and each committee will have to deal with about three assembly constituencies. We hope that in about one-two months, the survey will be completed. The weekly markets will also be counted in this," he said.
Kejriwal said the first choice will be that the vendors should be given the same spot where they are working, "but the final decision will be of the committee".
On being asked if this was being done just months before the Assembly polls to attract the hawkers and vendors, who were a key vote bank of the Aam Aaami Party, he said: "We started the work on this soon after coming to power (in 2015), but someone filed a case and the court has disapproved it. Now, in a way, we also have the court's approval."
The tenure of the Kejriwal government will end in February 2020. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had directed the civic bodies here to ensure pavements are cleared from all encroachments and Kejriwal said his government is working on solutions to save the livelihood of street vendors.

Free Press Journal
Mumbai: In a massive jolt to the Pawar family ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday registered a money laundering case against Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Shahrad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar and 75 others in a case involving the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB) scam, the probe agency said.
ED's move against the political big wigs from the NCP comes after the Bombay High Court in its last month's order asked the Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai Police to file FIR against Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and 75 others in the alleged scam. 
The ED filed its case based on the FIR of the Mumbai Police, which lodged a case in connection with the scam last month. 
The Bombay High Court had ordered to register an FIR in the alleged scam as petitioner Surinder Arora had filed the case in the Bombay HC seeking an investigation into the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank which was controlled largely by NCP leaders.

New Delhi [India], Sep 24 (ANI): At a time when the world is fighting against climate change, the Indian Army has cleared more than 130 tonnes of garbage from the Siachen glacier in the last 19 months."Under the 'Siachen Swachhta Abhiyan', Indian Army has managed to clean 130 tonnes of garbage from the Siachen Glacier since January 2018," Indian Army officials said on Tuesday.The garbage gets accumulated in the world's highest battlefield due to the deployment of Indian Army soldiers.The Indian Army has also now prepared a Standard Operating Procedure for its troops deployed in the glacier as per which while coming down to base camp, they have to bring along whatever little garbage they can carry in the tough conditions.Out of the 130.14 tonnes brought down, 48.14 tonnes is non-biodegradable while 40 tonnes include plastic and glass waste. The metallic content including shells of ammunition is around 41.45 tonnes.To take care of the waste collected from the Glacier, the Army has put up a paper bailer machine which converts the paper cartons and other such things which are reusable.For disposing off the non-metallic waste, the Army has put three incinerators at three different places. The Army is also looking for industrial crushers which can help in disposing off the metallic waste. (ANI)

Cricket Country
India‘s search for a reliable No. 4 continues with the latest claimant Rishabh Pant unable to jot together consistent performances. In the third and final T20I of a three-match series against South Africa on Sunday, Pant scored 19 off 20 putting himself in the crossfires of those questioning his batting spot in the batting line-up.
India vs South Africa news | India vs South Africa fixtures
After Sunil Gavaskar, batting legend VVS Laxman has also weighed in on Pant’s struggles blaming his aggressive game and lack of knowledge regarding how to build innings while batting at No. 4. Laxman suggests the young wicketkeeper-batsman should drop down the order at No. 5 or 6 that’ll give him more freedom to play the way he wants to.
“The nature of Rishabh Pant’s batting is that he plays aggressive shots…unfortunately at the international level he is not able to succeed at the number four position,” Laxman said on Star Sports. “Pant should bat at number 5 and 6, where you have the license to go out and express yourself and at the moment he doesn’t know the right method of scoring runs at number 4.”
But Laxman has backed Pant, who has excelled in Test cricket but yet to make a mark in limited-overs, to come good saying it’s just a phase which every cricketers is bound to encounter. “Every player goes through this phase, his natural game is free flowing but suddenly he is not gaining the same results (in IPL),” Laxman observed.
He continued, “He is trying to evolve and trying to add different dimensions to his game by rotating the strike that we saw in the previous match but unfortunately, his shot selection at the start of the innings has not been great. He also has a lot of pressure as he is taking the place of MS Dhoni who has done a lot for Indian cricket, to get his confidence back the team management needs to let him go bat at number 5 or 6 and express himself.”
Laxman feels allrounder Hardik Pandya and Shreyas Iyer are better candidates for the all-important spot. “There are other people to bat at number 4 like Hardik Pandya and Shreyas Iyer who are experienced and could play at that spot,” he said.

Times Now
Half-centuries by out-of-favour India opener Abhinav Mukund (75, 83 balls, 7 fours) and Baba Aparajith (52, 67 balls, 2 fours) helped Tamil Nadu put it across host Rajasthan by six wickets in its opening Group 'C' match of the Vijay Hazare Trophy here on Tuesday. Skipper Dinesh Karthik with a brisk knock of 52 not out (52 balls, 4 fours, 1 six) saw the team home in the company of M Shahrukh Khan (47 not out, 39 balls, 6 fours).
The left-handed Mukund and Aparajith set the platform for Tamil Nadu after the aggressive N Jagadeesan (7) fell in the seventh over to left-arm pacer Aniket Choudhary. Mukund played some fine shots while Aparajith preferred to be watchful and rotated the strike well. Earlier, sent in to bat by Tamil Nadu, the home team recovered from 53 for 4 to post 261 in the 50 overs, thanks to a strokeful knock of 77 by right-hander Arjit Gupta.
Gupta, who hit seven fours and three sixes in 82 balls, was involved in a 87-run partnership with Ashok Menaria (35). Medium-pacer K Vignesh bowled well to start with and got opener Chetan Bist (4) in the second over. He dismissed the other opener Manender Singh (7) and the key wicket of captain Mahipal Lomror (11, 27 balls) to reduce Rajasthan to 53 for 4.
In other matches on Tuesday, Tripura defeated Jammu & Kashmir by two wickets and Gujarat beat Bengal by 38 runs.
Brief scores: Rajasthan 261 for 9 in 50 overs (Arjit Gupta 77, Rahul Chahar 48, Ashok Menaria 35, K Vignesh 3/34, M Mohammed 2/58, R Sai Kishore 2/66) lost to Tamil Nadu (Abhinav Mukund 75, B Aparajith 52, Dinesh Karthik 52 not out, Shahrukh Khan 48 not out, Aniket Choudhary 1/53) by six wickets. Points: TN: 4, Rajasthan: 0.
Gujarat 253 for 8 in 50 overs (Bhargav Merai 63, Manprit Juneja 47, Kathan D Patel 36, Ashoke Dinda 3/58) beat Bengal 215 all out in 46.2 overs (Shreevats Goswami 79, Anustup Majumdar 39, Rush Kalaria 4/34, Axar Patel 1/47) by 38 runs.

A company called UAV Turbines has successfully completed the inaugural flight of its Monarch 5 engine, which is essentially a tiny version of the engines you see on planes. The company says this marks "the first
time a small-to-medium-sized drone has been powered by a turbine engine." UAV Turbines believes its technology can provide the military and commercial customers with a "reliable, efficient, safe, heavy-fuel propulsion system."
It explained that the UAV market is about to grow much, much more in the coming years, seeing as drones are being eyed for medicine drops, cargo delivery and search-and-rescue. "However, current engines do not offer the reliability and safety profile required to perform these tasks," it said in its announcement. It believes the Monarch 5 and its other turbine engines can deliver in terms of safety and reliability for military and commercial use. And it believes it could make unmanned vehicles as common as planes, trucks and ships.
Kirk Warshaw, UAV Turbines chief, said:
"Our attention now turns to working with commercial and military partners to develop airframes around our Monarch 5 propulsion system, similar to the manner that manned aircraft are designed and developed. Furthermore, we believe our Monarch engine's capabilities will be instrumental in driving the urban air mobility and defense industries forward in making unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) as commonplace as airplanes, trucks and ships for both commercial and defense use."

TechCrunch
Credit cards have become all but ubiquitous for consumer transactions, and it isn’t hard to see why. By intermediating payments, networks like Visa allow buyers and sellers to exchange money for goods and services without knowing the financial risk profile of the counter-party. Rather than applying for credit at every merchant you shop at, you apply once at your issuing institution, and then can transact with every merchant on the network. It’s the simple formula: reducing friction means more sales, and therefore more profits.
Yet for all the innovation in the consumer side of the economy, there has been an astonishingly limited amount of innovation in the B2B world. Payments between businesses are still conducted through invoices, with net payment terms that can exceed 90 days and with little knowledge of the financial risk of the counter-parties. There is no FICO score for business as there is with consumers, nor is there a system that can intermediate those transactions and reduce their friction.
That’s where Fundbox comes in. The SF-headquartered startup wants to ultimately transform B2B payments by creating a Visa-like payments network that allows businesses to transact with each other without having to know counter-party risk while also getting everyone paid faster.
It’s a vision that has pulled in the attention of even more venture capital. The company, which was founded in 2013, announced today that it has raised $176 million in a series C equity financing led by a consortium of funders, including Allianz X,  Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, HarbourVest and a litany of others. Existing backers Khosla, General Catalyst, and Spark Capital Growth also participated. With this new round of capital, the company’s total equity funding reaches upwards of $300 million.
Embedded finance, or why fintech mega VC rounds have become so common

In addition to the equity capital, the company also announced that it has raised a $150 million credit facility to underwrite its product.
Fundbox  CEO Eyal Shinar said that a priority in this fundraise was to select backers who not only could invest in equity, but also had large balance sheets who could expand the company’s underwriting capability as it scales.
Today, Fundbox’s core product is a revolving line of credit for small businesses. Cash flow is a huge concern for many companies, since they often have to wait for a payment from an invoice to arrive before investing in their next projects or hiring more employees. A revolving line of credit allows companies to flexibly draw down and pay back a loan, while only paying fees on what a company uses.
To apply for the loan, companies connect Fundbox to their financial data store (for example, QuickBooks), and Fundbox slurps in the data and offers a credit decision in as fast as minutes. Companies can then tap their line of credit almost immediately and use it as working capital. As invoices are paid, companies can then pay off their line of credit and stop paying fees.
From that product base, Shinar ultimately sees Fundbox as a GDP-scale startup, given the value it could potentially unlock for companies and the economy at large. “There are more than $3 trillion locked in those invoices,” he explained to me, “$3.4 trillion flows through consumer credit cards, but $23 trillion are in invoices … and even if you focus on [just] small and medium business, it’s $9 trillion.”
As the company collects data from all the players in the market, it wants to build upon those data network effects to ultimately operate the payment rails for B2B transactions. So instead of offering a line of credit to the seller, it could facilitate both sides of the transaction and get rid of the root complexity in the first place.
It’s a bold vision, and certainly one that has attracted a variety of players. In the startup world, Kabbage (whose co-founder and president Kathryn Petralia I will be interviewing at TechCrunch Disrupt SF next week) has built a business around line of credit lending and has similarly raised large amounts of venture capital.
Larger companies like Square,  PayPay, and Intuit (which owns the popular accounting software QuickBooks) have introduced various lending products to B2B customers. And in terms of payments, Stripe through its new credit card and Brex offer the means for companies to empower their employees to make purchases on behalf of the company.
Shinar said that a huge priority for Fundbox has been to make underwriting more efficient. He said that a large percentage of the current employee base at the company is data scientists, and the company has built upon the wave of digitalization that has taken place among small and medium businesses. “Every company has at least one set of APIs … and it is accessible, and it is granular,” Shinar said. By just tapping into those existing data feeds, Fundbox is able to avoid the human underwriting common with much of business lending today.
One initiative the company has undertaken is a tool dubbed “X-Ray” to better describe how the company’s machine learning models are really underwriting its loan products. Shinar noted that payments is a highly-regulated space, and that the company has to be able to explain its decisions and how they are unbiased to any regulator that might start asking questions.
The company today has 240 employees spread across SF, Tel Aviv, and a recently launched office in Dallas. Shinar says that he wants to use the new funds to “go on the offensive” and “double and triple down on what is working.”

Engadget
E-cigarette maker Juul is in trouble again. According to The Wall Street Journal, people familiar with the matter say that the company is the subject of a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in California. It's not yet been revealed what the focus of the investigation is, although sources say it's still in its early stages.
This will be another unwelcome challenge for the quickly-growing company, which has come under fire for the ways its sleek vaporizers have found appeal with young people. The Federal Trade Commission, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and several other state attorney generals are already investigating the company's marketing practices, although Juul maintains it never targeted underage users.
Meanwhile, the FDA has opened a wider criminal investigation into vaping in general, following hundreds of reports of vaping-related lung illnesses. This most recent probe may well be moot, though, since the Trump administration has announced plans to ban most flavored e-cigarettes. How that, and this new investigation, will affect Juul remains to be seen.

HOSHIARPUR: An 83-year-old man completed his master's degree in English from a university in Jalandhar this month.
Sohan Singh Gill, a native of Hoshiarpur, completed his bachelor's degree from Mahilpur in Hoshiarpur district decades ago. On the advice of his vice-principal, he wanted to do post-graduation in English. However, he got married in 1958 and left for Kenya with his wife.
Gill said that while working in Kenya, he also taught various subjects to children there. He returned to India in 1991.
"In 2018, I decided to prepare for the MA course in English remembering my vice-principal's advice," he said.
Gill finally got an MA English degree from Lovely Professional University in Jalandhar.
"I hope there are enough employment opportunities for the youth in our country so that they do not have to leave India in search of jobs," he said.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said his government will implement the 'Mukhyamantri Street Light Yojana' under which 2.1 lakh streetlight will be installed across the city to light up dark spots.
The three discoms will have the responsibility of installing them, he said.
Each discom will have the job of installing 70,000 streetlights, the chief minister said, adding that every street light will have a sensor that will light up after sunset, he said.
The streetlights will be installed on a similar model as that of CCTV cameras.
The scheme is likely to kick off from November 1. The MLAs will recommend the dark spots in their respective areas, he said.

https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/power-minister-bats-for-basic-customs-duty-on-imported-solar-panels?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
BloombergQuint
Union Power Minister RK Singh has urged the finance ministry to impose basic customs duty on solar equipment in a phased manner to boost domestic manufacturing.
Singh wrote a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking imposition of basic customs duty on imported solar cells and panels. BloombergQuint has reviewed a copy of the letter.
India is a signatory to the World Trade Organisation’s Information Technology Agreement signed in 1996 and solar photovoltaic cells and modules are classified under Customs Tariff Head 8541 and exempt from basic customs duty. The power minister, in his letter, sought a separate classification for solar panels.
This comes over three months after domestic solar equipment makers requested for a safeguard duty on solar cell imports from countries like Thailand and Vietnam.
To protect local producers, the government had imposed a 25 percent tariff on imports of Chinese and Malaysian solar cells and modules for the first year starting July 30, 2018, and 20 percent and 15 percent for the two subsequent six-month periods, respectively. The safeguard duty will expire in July 2020.
Still India’s solar equipment imports have not come down despite the safeguard duty. “For the first seven months of 2019, 77 percent of the solar cells and modules imported into India have come from China,” Rohit Gadre, analyst at BloombergNEF, told BloombergQuint in an e-mailed response.
Basic Customs Duty Proposed By Power Minister
Singh, however, said there should be no duty on wafers, silver paste, glass, aluminum frames, and other raw materials used for manufacturing of solar cells and panels till Dec. 31, 2023.
Singh said solar PV cells and modules under Customs Tariff Head 8541 should be separated into two custom tariff heads—solar PV cells and solar PV panels. “This will help to provide differential import duties and differential duty trajectory for both solar cells and panels.”
The proposal, if implemented, will increase total project cost of solar power developers by almost 20 percent which will further increase tariff to Rs 2.9 per unit, Shashi Shekhar, vice chairman at Acme Solar, told BloombergQuint over the phone, adding that distribution companies won’t buy at higher tariffs.
“This is not the way to increase domestic manufacturing capacity,” he said. “The way to make domestic manufacturing competitive is increasing domestic production of glass manufacturing, wafers, raw materials used for solar cells and panels. This should be done with technology upgradation.”
According to Indian Solar Manufacturers Association, the current installed capacity is 9 gigawatt for solar modules and 3.3 GW for solar cells.

Times Now
Taapsee Pannu has given a strong response to all those who have slammed the makers of Saand Ki Aankh for choosing her and Bhumi Pednekar over older actresses for the film. The two play the roles of 60+ UP-based sharpshooters Prakashi Tomar and Chandro Tomar in the film.
A part of Taapsee’s post read, “Did we ask the same question when we all loved what Anupam Kher did in Saaransh. Did we question when Nargis Dutt played mother to Sunil Dutt? Did we question John Trivolta for playing a woman in Hairspray?”
Below, see it:
 
I hope and can only hope this will answer the question once n for all coz honestly now it’s getting boring for us to repeat ourselves.
So all you lovely people here goes my RESPONSE -#SaandKiAankh pic.twitter.com/guldaTWaks
 
While the film’s trailer has largely been received well, a section of moviegoers felt that Taapsee and Bhumi did not look their parts and thus, the makers should have roped in senior actresses. The conversation gained momentum when actress Neena Gupta replied to a Twitter user, saying, “Yes i was just thinking about this hamari umar ke role toe kamsekam humse kara lo bhai” The user in question had suggested Neena’s name alongside Jaya Bachchan’s and Shabana Azmi’s for the Tushar Hiranandani directorial.
 
Yes i was just thinking about this hamari umar ke role toe kamsekam humse kara lo bhai https://t.co/6Fmrxn0HbE
 
It gained even more eyeballs when Kangana Ranaut’s sister Rangoli Chandel replied to Neena’s tweet. Rangoli claimed that her actress sister was first offered the film even as she accused the makers of “sexism.”
She wrote, “Neena ji Kangana was offered this movie and she loved the true story of Grandmom’s achievements she suggested yours and Ramya Krishnan ma’am’s name for lead roles but these men can’t remove deeply rooted sexism from their filthy brains ...”
“We will never have a Meryl Streep in India if we keep shamelessly displaying older women phobia like this... shame on you all Bolly filth... for promoting sexism in the name of feminism ...,” her another tweet read.

Earlier, the makers of Saand Ki Aankh had said that they had approached senior actresses for the film but to no avail.

The New Indian Express
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday rejected as "completely baseless" the Indian Army chief's statement on the reactivation of terror camp in Balakot that was destroyed by the IAF earlier this year.
Army chief General Bipin Rawat in Chennai on Monday said Pakistan has reactivated the Balakot terror camp very recently and about 500 infiltrators were waiting to sneak into India.
The response to the terror camp getting functional again may go beyond India's previous response by way of an airstrike in February, he told reporters here at the Officers Training Academy in the Tamil Nadu capital Chennai.
"Balakot has been reactivated by Pakistan very recently. This shows that Balakot has been affected, it had been damaged and destroyed. And that is why people have got away from there and now it has been reactivated. It highlights some action was taken by the Indian Air Force at Balakot and now they have got the people back there," he said.
"We will keep the enemy guessing and this time. Why repeat (Balakot). We may go beyond that," Rawat added.

The Indian Army Chief's statement on the reactivation of terror camp in Balakot is "completely baseless", the Foreign Office said in a statement.
The Army General also alleged that terrorists were trying to create a facade of a lockdown and that all restrictions would be eased gradually.
"There is a communication breakdown between terrorists in the Kashmir Valley and their handlers in Pakistan but there is no communication breakdown between people to people", he said.
The allegation of "infiltration" from Pakistan reflects "a desperate attempt" of India to divert international attention from the "humanitarian crisis" in Jammu and Kashmir, it said, adding that New Delhi will not "succeed in misleading the world community through these diversionary tactics".

Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India on August 5 revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two union territories.
Reacting to India's move on Kashmir, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner.
Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its "internal matter" and asked Islamabad to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric.
On February 27 this year, IAF fighters flew deep into Pakistan to bomb a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror facility at Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
The action came after the February 14 suicide bombing in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, which killed over 40 CRPF personnel.
Since then tensions between India and Pakistan had escalated.

Engadget
Amazon's yet-to-be announced Alexa-powered wireless earbuds could also double as a fitness tracker. CNBC reported today that the earbuds, deemed "Puget", will come with a built-in accelerometer that can track your run, the calories you've burned and your pace. We heard rumblings that Amazon is working on a competitor to Apple's Airpods earlier this year, but this is the first indication that it will also work as a health device.
It's unknown when exactly we'll catch a glimpse of these earbuds. Amazon is expected to unveil a host of new devices at its big hardware event on September 25th. As is typical, the company has remained silent on what exactly we can expect from the event. If last year is any guide, there will likely be some surprises in store. CNBC also reported that the company is working on an Echo device with better sound quality for music -- a rumor that we've heard before -- so we may see that item debut at the event as well.
Fitness tracking capabilities and a lower price could certainly give the new Alexa earbuds an edge over Apple's Airpods. AirPods are currently the best-selling wireless earpods in the world, making up 60 percent of the global market. But for Android users or those hunting for more affordable options, Amazon's upcoming entry could be an attractive alternative.

https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/23/online-extremism-group-run-by-social-media-giants-becomes-indepe/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Engadget
A group formed by Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube to combat terrorist abuse and online extremism on social media is becoming a separate organization. The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism has announced today that it plans on hiring an executive director and separate staff to lead the initiative, which was formed a little more than two years ago. Also joining the initiative will be Amazon, Whatsapp and Linkedin.
Group members today met with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss how social media giants are complying with the Christchurch Call to Action. The pledge -- written after a mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand that killed 51 people was broadcast on Facebook Live -- called on technology companies to help advert such incidents. Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Google and Microsoft back in May joined the pledge.
The independent GIFCT said they would be committed to carrying out the Christchurch Call's nine-point plan, which included better protocols for users to report harmful content, collaborating on technology, instilling checks on livestreaming to avoid spreading extremist material and more. Facebook unveiled a "one-strike" policy for its Facebook Live feature shortly after the Christchurch mass shooting but has yet to deploy any additional safeguards.
Most recently, the group contributed to a shared database of "hashes" or digital fingerprints of known terrorist images and video propaganda. Since terrorists often upload the same piece of content on multiple social media platforms, it's oftentimes useful for platforms to be on the lookout for such material before it spreads. The size of the database has grown in a period of two years to include more than 200,000 individual "hashes".
The group's new independence comes as governments around the world look for ways to take big tech companies to task for violent content. The Australian government earlier this year passed new laws that would penalize technology companies for allowing the streaming of videos containing serious offenses. The UK government is currently looking into fining social media giants for failing to protect their users from harmful content.

Times Now
In a bone-chilling incident, a couple in the US was left stunned when a hacker broke into their connected home and started talking to them via camera, played vulgar music on the video system in the living room and even turned the thermostat to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (over 32 degrees Celsius).
According to Fox 6 News, the incident happened with a Milwaukee (Wisconsin)-based couple who felt anything but safe after a hacker took over their smart home.
Samantha and Lamont Westmoreland realized something was seriously wrong when they began to hear a voice via a camera in the kitchen.
"My heart was racing. I felt so violated at that point," Samantha was quoted as saying.
The couple had installed a Google Nest system (camera, doorbell and thermostat) in their house in 2018.
On September 17, Samantha came home and found that the thermostat had been turned up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
She fixed it but the thermostat continued to go up, and a voice began speaking to the couple from a camera in the kitchen. The hacker later started playing vulgar music from the video system in the living room.
Changing their passwords did not help. The couple later spoke to their Internet service provider and gets their network ID changed.
The Westmoreland had spent $700 for the Google Nest system at home.
The Google Nest system generally offers thermostat, cameras, doorbell, alarm system, lock and smoke + CO alarm.
"It gives me the chills just talking about it," said Samantha.
The Milwaukee couple is not alone.
In January, a hacker took over an Illinois-based Indian-American couple's Nest cameras and began talking to their toddler.
"I was shocked to hear a deep, manly voice talking. My blood ran cold," Arjun Sud told WBBM-TV. The hacker also hurled obscenities at Sud and his wife.
Sud disconnected the cameras and contacted Nest which told him to use two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.
A California-based family also had a chilling experience when someone used their Nest camera's speaker to warn of an impending missile strike from North Korea.
A Google spokesperson told FOX6 News: "Nest was not breached. These reports are based on customers using compromised passwords (exposed through breaches on other websites). In nearly all cases, two-factor verification eliminates this type of security risk".
With 75 billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices expected to be in place by 2025, the cybersecurity concerns are only going to be increased with more and more homes being connected.

Reuters
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s financial intelligence agency on Tuesday ordered an audit of PayPal Holdings Inc’s compliance with local anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, saying it was concerned reporting obligations had not been met. 
AUSTRAC, which is tasked with ensuring compliance with the  laws, ordered PayPal’s Australian unit to appoint an external auditor to look at the fund transfers at its own cost and report back within 120 days. 
AUSTRAC said in a statement that International Funds Transfer Instructions reported by the financial sector provided intelligence that enabled the agency and its partners to combat serious crimes, such as child sex exploitation. 
“Regulated businesses like PayPal Australia, who facilitate payments and transactions for millions of Australian customers every year, play a critical role in helping AUSTRAC and our law enforcement partners stop the movement of money to criminals and terrorists,” AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose said in a statement. 
PayPal said its Australian unit reported itself to authorities after an internal review found an issue with the way it reported international fund transfers to AUSTRAC. 
It said suggestions the reason for the audit was the discovery of child sex exploitation connections were not correct. 
“We are working in full cooperation with AUSTRAC to remediate this reporting system issue and to undertake the audit as outlined by AUSTRAC in the time specified,” PayPal’s senior communications director, Amanda Christine Miller, said in an email.  
The audit would have no impact on customers, Miller added. 
U.S.-based PayPal operates a worldwide online payment service which connects buyers and sellers through a secure online wallet linked to both parties’ bank accounts. 
A preliminary report from a separate review ordered by AUSTRAC into buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay Touch Group in June, citing suspected non-compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, was due to be handed to AUSTRAC on Tuesday. 
Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) players let shoppers purchase products without paying upfront, and without the regulatory hurdle of applying for a credit card or loan, raising concerns about shopper identity. 
AUSTRAC and Afterpay did not immediately respond to questions about that review. 
Australian regulators are under sustained pressure to act after the Royal Commission inquiry into financial sector misconduct widely condemned their performance in recent years. 
The Royal Commission found that when misconduct by financial institutions was revealed, it either went unpunished or the regulatory consequences did not reflect the seriousness of what had been done.

TechCrunch
Honestbee, the Singapore-based grocery delivery startup that has been struggling with financial issues, owes 217 employees a total of almost USD $1 million in unpaid salary. The Strait Times reported that the figure was revealed in an affidavit filed in court on September 20 by Honestbee CEO Ong Lay Ann as part of the startup’s debt moratorium application.
The Ministry of Manpower told the Strait Times that 44 employees have filed claims with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management, with some of the employees settling mediation by agreeing to a payment schedule with Honestbee  that will be monitored by the alliance.
In an emailed statement to TechCrunch, an Honestbee spokesperson said, “There is a communicated salary delay for Honestbee’s ex-employees and employees currently serving notice. While there are regular injections of working capital, the amount remains insufficient for all headcount. As a result, the company has made the difficult decision to prioritize existing staff in Singapore. The company has the full intention in meeting its obligations to staff and will be, if not already in active discussions with staff in relation to a feasible payment schedule.”
[After this post was published, Honestbee emailed an additional statement: “The Company fully intends to honour its salaries to its employees. At present, the salaries of current employees are not affected. Only ex-employees will be subject to a payment scheme. The payment schedule for affected headcount in Singapore is being developed with ex-employees being paid across five tranches. The first intended payment planned for 30 September 2019.”]
TechCrunch reported in April that Honestbee was running out of money and trying to find a buyer. The company, which used to operate in eight markets across Asia, has stopped operating in Hong Kong and Indonesia, temporarily halted services in Japan and the Philippines and suspended its food delivery service in Thailand.
The affidavit filed by Ong says Honestbee currently has 190 employees, down from 523 full-time employees and 77 part-time workers in January.
Ong also said that Honestbee chairman Brian Koo resigned from the board on on September 12.
According to the affidavit, Koo and associates, including investment vehicles he set up, are owed about $258 million, or about 90% of Honestbee’s debt. Koo, a founding managing partner of venture capital firm Formation Group, was one of Honestbee’s earliest investors and served as interim CEO from May to July after former chief executive Joel Sng stepped down.

Reuters
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday denied trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating his Democratic rival Joe Biden, but wavered about whether he would release a transcript of a phone call that some Democrats say is grounds for his impeachment.  
Trump told reporters in New York that he did not pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July phone call to launch a corruption investigation into Biden and his son in return for U.S. military aid.  
“No I didn’t,” Trump said. 
A U.S. whistleblower lodged a complaint about the contents of Trump’s conversation with Zelenskiy, leading to calls from some Democrats that Trump be impeached for trying to enlist a foreign power to smear a domestic opponent.     
Biden, a former vice president, whose son Hunter worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine, is the front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 election.     
Trump gave a contradictory message about whether he would release a transcript of the call with the Ukrainian leader.      
“I may do it because it was a very interesting call,” Trump said. “It was a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,” he said. 
But he added: “I don’t think it’s a great precedent to be releasing calls with foreign countries, heads of foreign countries. So I don’t think it’s a great precedent.” 
Late on Monday, the Washington Post reported that Trump ordered his acting chief of staff to withhold $400 million in military aid for Ukraine a week before the phone call with Zelenskiy, citing three senior administration officials. 
One official told the Post that the decision to withhold the funds was based on corruption concerns and denied any link between blocking the money and pressing the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. 
Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives have called a caucus meeting for Tuesday afternoon to discuss the whistleblower complaint, a leadership aide said. 
Congressional Democrats demanded documents on Monday from the White House about the Trump team’s contacts with Ukraine. 
Three House committees - Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight - called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to produce documents related to contacts between Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. 
The Democratic-led committees said in a letter that they “jointly request documents related to reported efforts by President Trump and his associates to improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the president’s bid for reelection.” 
Seven first-term Democratic lawmakers also inched closer to calling for Trump’s impeachment, writing in a Washington Post op-ed: “If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.” 
Trump hit out on Monday at Biden, calling him and his son “corrupt.” 
Neither the president nor aides have provided any details of possible corruption by Biden when he was vice president under Trump’s predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama. 
There has been no evidence so far that Biden used his position as vice president to help his son, and he said in Iowa on Saturday that he had never spoken to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine.  
Ukrainian officials, while acknowledging they had met with Giuliani, have not said that they would open any investigation of Biden or his son.     
Ukraine’s former general prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Reuters on Friday that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden’s son in his relationship with the energy firm.     
The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported on Friday that Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian leader in the phone call to investigate the involvement of Biden’s son with the company. He also asked Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani, who had been urging Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens. 
On Sunday, Trump acknowledged that he discussed Biden and his son in the July 25 call.    
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate Intelligence Committee was working to get the intelligence community’s inspector general to speak to the panel to discuss the whistleblower’s allegations. 
A Senate aide said a briefing with the panel’s chairman and vice chairman was expected this week.     
The media reports about the phone call said Trump repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into the gas company in which Biden’s son was involved was fired. 
Biden has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired but denies it was to help his son. Biden said the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases. 
A top official in Zelenskiy’s administration told Reuters that Ukraine wanted to stay out of the domestic political battle in Washington and that any attempt by either side to take advantage of Ukraine would damage relations.

The New Indian Express
SINGAPORE: Authorities said that Singapore has detained three Indonesian maids without trial under tough security laws over allegations they donated funds to support the Islamic State (IS) group. It is the latest case of allegedly radicalised foreign domestic helpers arrested in the city-state, and the government said it highlighted the continued appeal of the jihadists' "violent ideology".
The trio, who worked as maids for between six and 13 years in Singapore, became supporters of IS after viewing online material last year, including videos of bomb attacks and beheadings, the interior ministry said.
Anindia Afiyantari (33), Retno Hernayani (36) and 31-year-old Turmini became acquainted around the time they were radicalised and developed a network of foreign contacts online who shared their pro-IS ideology.
"The three of them actively galvanised support online for ISIS. They also donated funds to overseas-based entities for terrorism-related purposes, such as to support the activities of ISIS and JAD. Turmini believed that her donations would earn her a place in paradise," said the ministry in a statement late Monday, using an alternative name for IS.
Officials did not say how much they contributed. JAD refers to Indonesian militant outfit Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, which has pledged allegiance to IS.
The women are being held under the city-state's Internal Security Act, which allows for detention without trial for up to two years. IS lost the last scrap of its self-declared "caliphate" this year but remains influential.
There are fears that foreign fighters returning from the Middle East could rejuvenate terror networks elsewhere, including in Southeast Asia. There has been a steady stream of such cases reported in Singapore, which is majority ethnic Chinese but has a sizeable Muslim minority.
Before the latest three cases, authorities had detected 16 radicalised foreign domestic workers since 2015, though none were found to have plans to carry out violent acts in Singapore. They were repatriated after investigations. About 250,000 domestic helpers from other parts of Asia work in affluent Singapore.

Times Now
Hong Kong's embattled leader said Tuesday more than 20,000 people have applied to take part in a dialogue session with her and "vent their anger" at the government after three months of huge pro-democracy protests.
It is the government's first attempt to reach out to the protestors since millions took to the streets in the biggest challenge to China's rule since the city's handover from Britain in 1997.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Thursday's meeting would be an opportunity for people to have their voices heard but some protesters said they were not interested as their demands are already clear.
"We have promised that participants from different background, with different political stands could express their opinions freely, even vent their anger," Lam said.
While thousands have applied, just 150 people will be chosen at random to attend the two-hour session with Lam, and protest equipment such as umbrellas, helmets and gas masks will not be allowed.
"I hope the community dialogue could be held in a peaceful, rational and calm environment," Lam said.
Hong Kong has entered the 17th week of political unrest which seen hundreds of rallies, some of which ended in violent clashes between police and protestors.
More than 1,500 people have been arrested, the youngest aged 12.
Lam said she felt "heart-ache" seeing children being arrested and asked, "how well can children understand the current political issues?"
"Here I need to urge parents, teachers and principals must let children know that political problems are not that simple," Lam added.
Her remarks drew criticism from opposition legislators.
"You never under-estimate the young's voice," pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said.
"Many young people these days are very mature-minded and they knew perfectly what they are thinking... and what a civilised society should be."
The protests were initially against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, but have snowballed into wider calls for democracy and police accountability in the semi-autonomous city.
Video emerged over the weekend of officers kicking a detained man wearing a yellow shirt in an alley.
At a press conference Monday a senior police officer suggested it was not clear the "yellow object" was a man and claimed the video might have been doctored, sparking ridicule online.
Higher-resolution footage of the same incident shows a man on the ground, surrounded by police, one of whom kicked him.
Police have repeatedly denied using excessive force and Lam insisted they had exercised restraint.
"The fact that over three months, we have not seen major fatalities in Hong Kong, by world standard ... it is quite remarkable," Lam said.

(Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) said on Monday it would phase out all diesel cars by 2021 in favour of models with electric propulsion systems, as the Japanese automaker moves to electrify all of its European cars by 2025. 
By next year, according to European Union emission targets, CO2 must be cut to 95 gram per km for 95% of cars from the current 120.5 gram average, a figure that has increased of late as consumers spurn fuel-efficient diesels and embrace SUVs. All new cars in the EU must be compliant in 2021.     
For Honda, declining demand for diesel vehicles and tougher emissions regulations have clouded its manufacturing prospects in Europe. 
Honda said in February it would close its only British car plant in 2021 with the loss of up to 3,500 jobs. 
Japan’s No. 3 automaker has said it would cut the number of car model variations to a third of current offerings by 2025, reducing global production costs by 10% and redirecting those savings towards advanced research and development.

The much anticipated OnePlus TV is just two days away from launching in the Indian market. With the event just right around the corner, OnePlus founder and CEO, Pete Lau has just revealed some new information. Lau posted a new tweet sharing new details about the upcoming Smart TV product. As part of the tweet, we know know that the OnePlus TV will come with a bezel-less display. In addition, the image of the TV also indicated that we will get a TV with curved corners. Similar to other Tweets in the past, Lau also added text to the tweet highlighting the “details” of the device.
Though the glass panel in front of the device may be bezel-less, this likely does not translate into a bezel-less display. The caption of the tweet stated “To make premium design, no detail is too small, so we make the bezel-less. #OnePlusTV”. In addition to this, Lau also tweeted real-world images on OnePlus TV. The image indicated that the Smart TV may come in two different sizes. Though, it is possible that the different sized TVs in the image made be rivals for comparison. However, previous reports about OnePlus TV indicate that the company will launch two different variants of the TV.
OnePlus TV will come pre-installed with Hungama Play; strategic partnership announced
The real-world image also shows off the thing bezel on the corners of the device. In addition, we also see a thick-chin on the bottom of the device that looks like a proper bezel. The image also shows off the oval-shaped bottom stand and OnePlus TV remote on the table.

Reuters
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors have accused Volkswagen’s CEO of holding back market-moving information on rigged emissions tests four years ago, raising the prospect of fresh upheaval at the carmaker just as it tries to reinvent itself as a champion of clean driving.  
Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig said on Tuesday they would press criminal charges of stock market manipulation against Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, as well as non-executive Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn. 
The charges show how the German company, which in September 2015 admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests, is struggling to move on from a scandal which has cost it more than $30 billion (24 billion pounds) in vehicle refits, fines and provisions.  
Court proceedings are under way over that admission. The indictment from the prosecutors in Braunschweig - in Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) home region of Lower Saxony - is part of a separate legal push to try managers over an alleged delay in informing investors of the company’s wrongdoing.  
Lawyers for the three accused said they would contest the charges that they knowingly held back vital information. Volkswagen said its full supervisory board would convene on Wednesday to discuss the indictments. 
In a statement issued after an emergency meeting, the board’s executive committee said it “cannot see that there was any deliberate attempt not to inform the capital market”. 
If accepted by a Braunschweig state court, the indictment would lead to a trial date being set. 
The former U.S. regulator who helped bring Volkswagen’s  cheating to light dismissed the company’s arguments. 
“The excuse that top managers knew nothing is very weak,” Alberto Ayala, who served at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) until 2017, told German news magazine Spiegel. 
Separately on Tuesday, German prosecutors hit rival carmaker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) with an 870 million euro fine for breaking diesel emissions rules. The Stuttgart-based maker of Mercedes-Benz cars said it would not appeal. 
Volkswagen this year bucked a trend of falling demand for passenger cars by launching a range of popular sport utility vehicles, and is investing billions to try to become a leader in electric and self-driving technologies. 
Its shares were down 2% at 153.42 euros in afternoon trade. 
Diess’s lawyer said the indictment would not hinder him in his role as CEO, adding that as Diess did not join Volkswagen until July 2015 he could not have foreseen the scandal would have such a huge impact on the company.  
Volkswagen shares lost up to 37% in value in the days after the scandal broke. Had investors known about the emissions test cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, plaintiffs have argued. 
Volkswagen and its executives have said the fallout from the scandal was not foreseeable, and that they had expected to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities prior to the disclosure of the test cheating.  
Braunschweig prosecutors said the accused should have kept investors informed. 
“They pursued a strategy to achieve a settlement with the U.S. authorities without disclosing all relevant information,” they said in a statement.  
Winterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke, having been CEO for eight years. He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than Volkswagen had officially admitted.  
Poetsch became a management board member at Volkswagen in 2003 and was made chairman in 2015.  
The 636-page indictment alleges Winterkorn was fully aware of the matter and potential financial damage to Volkswagen as of March 2015. Poetsch was allegedly informed on June 29 and Diess on July 27. 
Investigations into the alleged perpetrators of the illegal engine control software, also known as defeat devices, have seen the arrest of the then CEO of Volkswagen’s Audi (NSUG.DE) unit, Rupert Stadler.     
In July 2019, Stadler - whose contract was later terminated by Volkswagen - and three defendants were charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices.     
Investigations into a further 23 suspects continue, the Munich prosecutor said at the time. 
Braunschweig prosecutors in April charged Winterkorn and four other managers with fraud over their role in the manipulation of emissions testing.

Times Now
New York: Humiliations after humiliations, yet Pakistan does not fail to create fresh opportunities to make a mockery of itself, at home or globally. ‘Kashmir’ has not been a favourable diplomatic topic for India’s neighbouring country, yet it continues to raise the matter, be it through their politicians or its crop of journalists.
When US President Donald Trump met Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit on Monday, the two leaders addressed a joint press conference.
However, during the ‘question and answer’ session, a journalist, who claimed to be an independent reporter and apparently hailing from Pakistan, posed certain questions to Trump on Kashmir.
The US President was quick to take a dig at the reporter, asking him whether he was from the Imran Khan camp.
“You are asking both the parties to accept and agree. One is aggressor (inaudible) the UN resolutions...and that's non-compliant...plus, you know, merging Kashmir into its own territory (sic),” the reporter asked.
Trump was quick to point at Imran Khan and say, “Where do you find reporters like this? These guys are fantastic. This is the kind of reporter I like. Are you a member of his team?”
Reporter: You are asking both the parties to accept and agree. One is aggressor (inaudible) the UN resolutions...and that's non-compliant...plus, you know, merging Kashmir into its own territory...
Trump: (Looks at Imran Khan) Where do you find reporters like this? These guys are fantastic. This is the kind of reporter I like. Are you a member of his team?
Reporter: I am not a member of his team. I am an independent journalist...
Trump: You know what? You are saying what you think.
Reporter: No, let me complete my question, Mr President.
Trump: You are right. You have to have two parties that want to agree. I have a very good relation with Prime Minister Modi, I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan and if at any time they say 'you know, we have some points that we can, maybe, iron out', I think I'd be an extremely good arbitrator. I have done it before, believe it or not, and I have never failed as an arbitrator, as to arbitrate pretty big disputes, from friends, and I have done it in a good successful fashion. (Looks at Imran) You know that, if I can be of help, let me know. But you have to have the (inaudible) also from the other side.

Donald Trump has suggested he is deserving of a Nobel prize 'for a lot of things', but has not received one yet because they are not given out fairly. 'They gave one to Obama immediately ... and he had no idea why he got it,' the US president complained.
Trump went on to offer his services as a mediator between India and Pakistan, touting his experience in arbitrating 'pretty big' disputes between his friends. 'I've never failed as an arbitrator,' he told Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan. 'If I can be of help, let me know.'

Times Now
New York: Months before her tragic death in August 1962, Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe did a photo session with Canadian photographer Douglas Kirkland for Look magazine. The two photographs - Marilyn (Overhead) and Marilyn (Hugging Pillow) - taken in Beverly Hills on that November evening, remain among the last professional images of the star.
Monroe was at the pinnacle of her fame then and the photographs live on as quintessential "Old Hollywood" moments of all time.
Now, global auction house Christie's is putting two limited-edition archival prints of those images, back of two Life magazine in they appeared as well as Kirkland's 1959 Hasselblad 500C camera together with his two Carl Zeiss lenses on auction. The items are scheduled to go under the hammer on October 29.
According to Christie's, what makes the pictures unique is that, "With little other than a bedsheet, a bottle of champagne and Frank Sinatra's voice crooning from a record player, the young Kirkland was able to capture on film the ethereal and transcendent beauty of a true icon with unmatched skill and intensity."
Apart from Monroe, Kirkland has photographed a multitude of stars and cultural icons, including Brigitte Bardot, Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren, Catherine Deneuve, Diana Ross, Billy Idol, Coco Chanel and Andy Warhol.

Reuters
SEOUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group will invest $1.6 billion in a joint venture to develop self-driving vehicle technologies with Aptiv (APTV.N), the biggest overseas investment by the South Korean carmaker to catch up to rivals in the autonomous car market.  
Global carmakers and their suppliers are forging alliances to develop autonomous car technologies partly due to the need to share the huge financial and technical burdens. Hyundai has lagged global rivals who have invested heavily into developing new technologies for electrified and autonomous vehicles.  
Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), Kia Motors (000270.KS) and Hyundai Mobis (012330.KS) will collectively contribute $1.6 billion in cash and $400 million in research and development resources and others, valuing the joint venture $4 billion, Hyundai Group and Aptiv said in a joint statement.      
Dublin-headquarterd Aptiv, which will own 50% of the joint venture, will contribute its autonomous driving technology, intellectual property, and about 700 employees focused on the development of scalable autonomous driving solutions.  
Aptiv Chief Executive Kevin Clark in a joint interview with Hyundai Executive Vice Chairman and heir apparent Euisun Chung on Monday the joint venture at this point would not get involved in running ride-hailing, data or network services of its own. 
Instead, the new firm would begin testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and have a production-ready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers, fleet operators and automakers in 2022.  
“Uber is developing its own technology, but potentially our technology could be better than theirs and then they could also become our customers,” Chung said through a translator. 
Hyundai Motor aims to commercialise its own autonomous vehicles in 2024. 
Clark said the alliance would initially focus on self-driving technology for passenger vehicles. But Chung said the Aptiv partnership ultimately also could help Hyundai speed up automation for commercial vehicles, such as long-haul trucks. 
The executives said their technology would be tested and developed across Asia, Europe and the United States to offer products tailored to major markets. They said they would discuss additional alliance members going forward. 
The new joint venture will be based in Boston, with technology centers across the United States and Asia.  
U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking before a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said the deal would reinforce the alliance between Washington and Seoul. 
Aptiv, which manufactures vehicle components and provides technology for self-driving cars, was formerly known as Delphi Automotive, which was split into Aptiv and Delphi Technologies (DLPH.N) in 2017. 
Deutsche Bank said in a report that Hyundai’s cash injection would enable Aptiv to cut its near-term funding needs. But Deutsche questioned whether the new structure could deter other automakers from sourcing autonomous systems from Aptiv in the future. 
Aptiv’s major customers include GM, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Fiat, according to its annual report. Hyundai Motor is also one of its customers, a Hyundai spokesman said.      
Market research firm Navigant Research put Aptiv at No.4 among automated driving system companies, following Waymo, General Motors (GM.N) and Ford (F.N). Hyundai was not among the top 10 vendors. 
The latest investment is another sign that Hyundai has abandoned its strategy of developing technology in-house, a strategy which previously raised investor concerns that it may be left behind in the race for future mobility.      
Hyundai, which along with affiliate Kia Motors ranks fifth in global sales, has joined rivals in making a series of investments in technology firms, including self-driving car tech startup Aurora, especially after Chung was promoted a year ago. 
Hyundai Motor said in February that it would invest 14.7 trillion won ($12.3 billion) in future technologies such as self-driving, connectivity and car-sharing areas by 2023.  
In March, Hyundai Motor and Kia announced a plan to invest $300 million in Indian ride-hailing platform Ola, following the $275 million that the pair invested in Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab last year.  
The Aptiv venture will be headquartered in Boston. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Robert Vadra has opposed in the Delhi High Court the Enforcement Directorate's plea challenging his anticipatory bail in a money laundering case.
Vadra, son-in-law of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, said in his reply that there was no single instance of his non-cooperation with the investigation and there was no risk of him tampering with any evidence as the ED has already seized from him every document pertaining to the case.
ED was conducting a fishing and roving enquiry and has no material to support the allegations made against him, he claimed. The matter is scheduled to come up for hearing in the court on September 26.
ED had sought in the high court cancellation of Vadra's anticipatory bail on the ground that it required his custody as he was not cooperating in the investigation.

Regarding the allegation of flight risk, Vadra said in his reply, "The conduct of the respondent (Vadra) in returning to India from abroad voluntarily upon reading press reports that ED was investigating him made it abundantly clear that Vadra had no intention of whatsoever of fleeing the country and was determined to stay in India and clear the name."
The response added that Vadra has volunteered to appear before the probe agency even though he was yet to receive summons from them.
No specific allegation has been made by the agency to suggest that Vadra has in any way attempted to or actually succeeded in tampering with any evidence or witness, it said.
"Vadra has no properties outside India whatsoever nor does he have any beneficial ownership of any property outside India," the reply claimed.
It added that Vadra has never received any 'kickback' for any 'deal' and any allegations of this nature are completely false.
It claimed that the sole purpose of the agency is to cause prejudice in the mind of court and the public against Vadra.
Vadra is facing allegations of money laundering in the purchase of a London-based property at 12, Bryanston Square worth 1.9 million pounds (over Rs 17 crore).
The case is being probed under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The trial court, while granting anticipatory bail to Vadra, had directed him not to leave the country without prior permission and also to join the probe as and when called by the investigating officer.
The ED had told the court that they required his custody as he was not cooperating in the investigation and the trial court had not discussed the gravity of the offence in its order.
The agency had said that everything was shown to the trial court special judge but it has not discussed the gravity of the offence in the trial court order.
The plea has challenged the trial court's order saying the special judge had failed to consider the settled position of law that bail should not be "granted in a routine manner".
It had said the protection given to him would be detrimental to its probe on certain crucial aspects, including ascertaining the exact source of the allegedly tainted money and the end use of the funds involved in the case.
ED had further said that Vadra has "maliciously" claimed to be a victim of political vendetta and made all possible attempts to sensationalise the case.
It had said the other important aspects of the probe are related to unearthing the entire source of credits for purchasing the properties and ascertaining the details of all similar transactions in the accounts of the entities concerned.
The agency had said it will also require to confront Vadra with voluminous incriminating material for bringing the investigation to a logical conclusion.
ED said it has received information about various new properties in London which allegedly belong to Vadra, including two houses worth 4-5 million pounds each and six flats.

Land-clearing fires are causing a high increase in the level of particulate pollutants in the air which filter out some of the sun’s wavelengths, resulting in the intense red effect, according to a spokesman for Indonesia’s Meteorology Climatology and Geophysics Agency.

Illegal land clearance burnings across Indonesia create significant smoke and haze every year. Thousands of schools were closed in the country earlier this month due to the poor air quality. 
The state recently deployed thousands of additional officers to fight fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan, bringing the total number of personnel involved to over 14,000.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday, 24 September held that police cannot attach immovable properties during investigation of a criminal case.
A bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna held that Section 102 of CrPC does not include the power of police to seize and attach immovable properties.
Justice Khanna, who read the judgment for the bench, said it is a concurring judgment but Justice Gupta has given some additional reasons.
The Bombay High Court, in its majority verdict, had held that police has no power to seize property during the course of investigation.
The Maharashtra government had challenged the said verdict of the high court before the top court.

The News Minute
When Childline officials at Malappuram district approached a Class 7 student for counselling following a request from her school, they never imagined that it will unravel a heinous crime. At the counselling session on Saturday, the girl recounted stories of sexual abuse, at the hands of different men, and allegedly with the knowledge of her parents.
According to sources in Childline, the 12-year-old girl was being sexually abused and even raped by multiple persons in the last two years. "The instances seem to be numerous and the child seemed to have no count over how many times she was abused," a Childline official told TNM. Medical reports have confirmed that the child was indeed raped.
The incident came to light when recently, other parents from the same taluk informed the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of the child’s school that they suspected she was being subjected to something inappropriate at home. “The teachers then began to observe the student. She was absent in the school on most days and mostly kept to herself. As the teachers felt that something was bothering the girl, they informed Childline,” said the source.
“She told us that her father's friends did things to her. But we realised the gravity of the situation when we understood that the child was actually pushed into sex trade by her parents. From what we came to know, the parents are not in a good financial condition and they made a living with this,” alleged a source in district Childline to TNM.
According to officials of Tirurangadi police, of the multiple persons who have allegedly abused her, she could clearly name only two persons. “We have arrested those two along with the father of the child. We are finding it a bit difficult to proceed with the case as the child does not know the names of any other people who have abused her and the father is staunchly denying all allegations,” said the official.
The two arrested other than the girl’s father are 38-year-old Shaiju Karappan and 36-year-old Ashraf Muhammad Kutty.
The two have been charged with sections 354 (A) (1) (i) (Physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures), 376 (Rape) of Indian Penal Code and sections 4 (Punishment for penetrative sexual assault), section 6 (Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and section 10 (Punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
“The child is not giving statements to the police as she spoke to the officials of Childline. The only thing she told us was that her mother was unaware of this, while her father knew. But the father has denied the allegation,” the police official stated.
The child is at present under the care of Child Protection Committee members and is housed in a rescue home in the district.

Reuters
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson and unions questioned the part played by Thomas Cook’s richly rewarded bosses in the company’s demise on Tuesday, and asked why the state had to foot the bill for bringing tens of thousands of tourists home. 
Some 16,500 holiday makers were flying back to Britain on the second day of the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, the Civil Aviation Authority said. 
Running hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year, Thomas Cook had around 600,000 people abroad when it collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning. 
It will need the help of governments and insurers to bring them back from places as far afield as Cancun, Cuba and Cyprus.  
Speaking in New York, Johnson said tour operators should be insured against such debacles. 
“I have questions for one about whether it’s right that the directors, or whoever, the board, should pay themselves large sums when businesses can go down the tubes like that,” he said.  
“You need to have some system by which tour operators properly insure themselves against this kind of eventuality.”  
Thomas Cook was brought down by a $2.1 billion debt pile, built up by a series of ill-fated deals, that hobbled its response to nimble online rivals. It had to sell three million holidays a year just to cover interest payments.  
With the business draining cash, Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser found its lenders were no longer willing to step in. Fankhauser has earned 8.3 million pounds ($10.3 million), including 4.3 million pounds in 2015. 
The Unite union said changes were needed to stop UK airlines collapsing at huge cost to the taxpayer, workers and customers. 
“Ministers must legislate as necessary to allow UK airlines in financial trouble to trade in protective administration,” the union said. “Other countries do it as a matter of course. We should do it in the UK.”  
The company’s British fleet was grounded immediately after the group became insolvent to comply with operating license requirements. 
But its other airline operations in the Nordics and Germany, which are separate legal entities, were still flying on Tuesday. 
In Spain, the country’s Acting Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto told reporters that the ministry has been in touch with German and Swedish authorities to ensure Thomas Cook subsidiaries continued to operate at least for the winter season. 
British tourists staying in Sunrise Royal Makadi Hotel near the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in Egypt said they had no information about flights home. 
Holidaymaker Andrew Vick, aged 55, said: “There are no representatives to talk to here at all, which is understandable because they have lost their jobs, so they are gone. 
“It is just not knowing what to do next, that is the problem,” he said.  
The British government said it was unwilling to “throw good money after bad” to bail out the company. 
Reports on Monday said the Turkish government and a group of Spanish hoteliers were willing to support a 200 million pound rescue plan underpinned by a British government guarantee. 
Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom, however, said the sum reported would not have kept the operator going for more than a couple of weeks. 
“There are all sorts of rumors flying, the fact is that 200 million (pounds) was even an underestimate of what Thomas Cook would have needed just for the very short term, for the next week or two,” she told Sky News. 
“Thomas Cook is sitting on trying to service 1.7 billion pounds of debt, and it would have been a waste of taxpayers’ money to be throwing good money after bad.” 
Leadsom said she had asked the Insolvency Service to fast track an inquiry into the collapse, “just to make sure whether there has been in fact any wrongdoing, anything that could have been done differently that could have averted this disaster.” 
Britain’s Financial Reporting Council said it was considering investigating Thomas Cook in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.  
Thomas Cook’s demise sparked alarm at hotels where some customers have been asked to pay their bills again by out-of-pocket resort owners. 
“I think the questions we’ve got to ask ourselves now: how can this thing be stopped from happening in the future?” Johnson said. 
Emergency flights brought 14,700 people back to the United Kingdom on 64 flights on Monday, and around 135,300 more were expected to be returned over the next 13 days, Britain’s aviation regulator said.

Daily Mail
A woman who was told she may never become a mother after being born with two reproductive systems has given birth to a total of four children.
Lauren Cotter, 34, was diagnosed with uterus didelphys aged 16 following years of  agonising period pains.
The condition – which affects around one in 3,000 women - meant she was born with two uteruses, two cervixes and, in her case, two vaginas.
The primary school teacher was told that carrying and delivering children would be difficult because her wombs and cervixes were half the size of an average woman.  
But, against the odds, Mrs Cotter and childhood sweetheart husband Ben, 33, have become parents to Amelie, five, Harvey, three, and 15-month-old twins Maya and Evie.
Lauren Cotter, 34, and childhood sweetheart husband Ben, 33, have become parents to Amelie, five, Harvey, three, and 15-month-old twins Maya and Evie against the odds
Mrs Cotter (pictured after giving birth to son Harvey) was diagnosed with uterus didelphys at 16 and told she'd struggle to carry and deliver children
The condition – which affects around one in 3,000 women - meant the mother (pictured heavily pregnant with the twins) was born with two uteruses, two cervixes and, in her case, two vaginas 
Mrs Cotter carried all her daughters in her right womb, while Harvey grew in her left. Diagram shows how a normal uterus compares to sufferers of uterus didelphys
The mother carried all the girls in her right womb, while Harvey grew in her left. 
Mrs Cotter, from Melbourne, Australia, said: 'From quite early, on Ben and I discussed having children and it was clear that he really wanted to be a dad.
'I knew I had to be open and honest and tell him that might not be a possibility for me.
'Luckily he wasn't bothered. We talked it through and agreed that there was more than one way to have a baby if you wanted it badly enough.
'But actually, we have found it easy to fall pregnant – I am not sure why, or if it has anything to do with my two vaginas.' 
After starting her periods aged 14, Mrs Cotter soon began to suffer with painful cramps and heavy bleeding.
An ultrasound two years later revealed she had uterus didelphys, which occurs when the uterus fails to fuse properly during development in the womb.
The mother met husband Ben at 17 and the pair married in 2012. Desperate to become parents, the newlyweds started trying for a baby a year after tying the knot
Twins Maya and Evie after being born on June 5, 2018, weighing 5lb 13oz and 5lb 4oz respectively.
Miracle babies: Mrs Cotter conceived the twins despite being fitted with a contraceptive implant which is said to be 99 per cent effective
According to the World Health Organisation, the condition affects around one in 3,000 women.
A few months after her diagnosis, Mrs Cotter had laser surgery to remove the dividing wall between her two vaginas, which enabled her to enjoy a normal love life. 
A year later, when she was 17, she met her police detective husband and the loved-up couple got married in Melbourne in 2012.
Desperate to become parents, the newlyweds started trying for a baby a year after tying the knot.
Uterus didelphys, also known as a double uterus, is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus, to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas, though this is not always the case.
It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes.
As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ — the uterus.
Sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ so the woman is born with two wombs.
It often only becomes noticeable after puberty and is diagnosed with a physical exam or an ultrasound scan.
In terms of physical anatomy, the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit, though they can be as big as a 'normal' womb.
It also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb.
Some women are also born with two vaginas, although they can have sex and menstruate in the same way as people with just one.
'They may know they have two and be able to find them, or they may not realise,' Dr Leila Hanna, a consultant gynaecologist & Obstetrician at BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline.
'It can be painful because there are two squashed in the same area, so sometimes we do an operation to join them together, but its not necessary.
'They could also have abnormalities of their kidneys and the tube which bring the urine from the bladder.'
Women will frequently have a slightly higher risk of late miscarriage, premature delivery and bleeding during pregnancy.
Often Caesarean sections are recommended, to reduce the risk of complications.
There is no treatment or cure for the condition.
But, while fertility itself was not an issue, Mrs Cotter was warned that miscarriages and stillbirths were a possibility given that her wombs were half the average size.
The couple, who were braced for a difficult road to parenthood, were shocked when Mrs Cotter became pregnant with Amelie in October 2013 after just a month of trying.
Mrs Cotter said: 'We decided to give it a go, and just see what happened. We knew it might be a bumpy road and tried not to get our hopes up too much.
'Just a month after we started trying, I bought a stack of pregnancy tests and started taking them weekly.
'Then one morning, I had a test to hand, and there on the stick was a very, very, faint blue line.
'I couldn't be sure, so I took a test each morning that week, and each day the line got darker and darker until I was sure - we were pregnant.' 
The pregnancy went smoothly and baby Amelie was delivered by Caesarean section on June 12, 2014, at Melbourne's Mercy Hospital for Women, weighing a healthy 6lbs 13oz.
Settling into family life, the couple decided to start trying for baby number two around 18 months later.
After just two months Mrs Cotter became pregnant and was surprised to discover at her first scan that her baby was growing in her left womb, not her right, as before.
'I carried Amelie in my right, and just assumed the left one was a dud,' she added.
Following another problem-free pregnancy, Harvey was delivered by Caesarean at 33 weeks.
Arriving at the Mercy Hospital for Women, he weighed 4lbs 12oz, and, after initially struggling to swallow on his own, was allowed home after three weeks.
Already busy raising two young children, Mrs Cotter was unsure if she wanted to try again right away.
So a year and a half after having Harvey she was fitted with a contraceptive implant on the advice of her consultant.
'The Pill was giving me migraines and I couldn't use the coil, so in the end the implant was the only option left,' she said. 
According to the NHS, the implant is more than 99 per cent effective – but just three weeks after having it fitted, Mrs Cotter became pregnant with twins. 
'This feeling came over me, and on some level, I knew I was pregnant,' she said. 
'The day my period was due, I dug out a pregnancy test, and within minutes my suspicions were confirmed.' 
Mrs Cotter, from Melbourne, Australia, caresses her 15-month old twins Maya and Evie 
Ben brings daughter Amelie and son Harvey to meet their new siblings in hospital in June 2018. Evie (pictured in the incubator) was born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs when a baby is born with their intestines in the chest cavity
'Shocked doesn't begin to cover it. During 17 years together, Ben and I had only ever got pregnant when we'd planned it. Now, here we were, having surprise twins.'
Concerned about how long Mrs Cotter would be able to carry twins due to her condition, doctors put her on strict bed rest from 19 weeks onward.
'My doctor was very honest and said he couldn't know how the pregnancy was going to play out,' she said.
By the 37 week mark Maya and Evie were delivered by Caesarean on June 5, 2018, weighing 5lbs 13oz and 5lbs 4oz, respectively.
While they initially seemed perfectly healthy, drama struck just hours after their arrival when Evie began struggling with her breathing and was sent to intensive care.
An X-ray of her lungs showed she was suffering with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs when a baby is born with their intestines in the chest cavity.
At just five days old she had keyhole surgery, which her parents were warned she had just a 50 per cent chance of surviving. 
But the youngster made a full recovery and was ready to come home after three weeks.
Now 15 months old, the twins are happy, healthy and at the centre of the family's 'crazy, hectic and amazing' life.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Greta Thunberg, the teenage Swedish environmental activist who has taken social media by storm through her rousing speech at the UN Climate Change Summit in New York was lauded by India opening batsman Rohit Sharma who labelled her as 'an inspiration'.
"Leaving the saving of our planet to our children is utterly unfair. @GretaThunberg, you're an inspiration. There are no excuses now. We owe the future generations a safe planet. The time for change is now," Sharma tweeted on Tuesday.

The 16-year-old Thunberg has taken a year off from her studies to spread awareness about climate change.
"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We are in the beginning of mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth - how dare you," Thunberg said at the UN Climate Change Summit.

Greta, who has become the global face of the growing youth movement against climate inaction, began her speech by telling her audience amusingly, "My message is that we will be watching you."
In her speech, the activist also addressed the pressing issue of the dangerous global heating across the world, saying, "I shouldn't be here. I should have been back at school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?"
"For more than 30 years, the signs have been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you are doing enough when the politics and the solution needed are still nowhere in sight," she added.
Thunberg has been protesting outside the Swedish Parliament every Friday since August 2018 against inaction over climate change.
The Climate Change summit was hosted by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to give a boost to the 2015 Paris Agreement and address the global climate emergency.
On the other hand, Sharma is all set to open the batting for India in the Test format after KL Rahul's omission from the team.
India will take on South Africa in a two-match Test series, slated to begin from October 2.
The series will be a part of World Test Championship.

WhatsApp traceability case: Madras HC asks platform if it complies with IT Act
The Madras High Court has asked the social messaging platform Whatsapp to confirm whether it complies with the Information Technology (IT) Act 2000, The Economic Times reports.
Madras HC Judge M Satyanarayanan had asked the Facebook-owned entity to respond after the Tamil Nadu state government said the encrypted messaging platform was bound to comply with the provisions of the IT Act, 2000.
The High Court is hearing a case on linking social media accounts to an individual's proof of identity. WhatsApp has resisted state government’s attempts to access user information, saying that traceability is a violation of user privacy. 
In a related development, the digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court against Facebook's request to transfer the case outside Madras HC. 
The centre is currently working on amending rules under Section 79 that is aimed at fighting rumours and fake news over the internet and social media platforms, the report added.
With a user base of 400 million, India is WhatsApp’s largest market. 
Flipkart expects strong sales during its Big Billion Days
 
Walmart-owned ecommerce giant Flipkart expects strong sales in tier II and tier III cities during of The Big Billion Days (TBBD) event this year, reports the Mint. 
Ecommerce companies have ramped up logistics and have also hired thousands of temporary workers to ensure delivery of products ahead of festive sales, the report said. 
Flipkart’s annual event will be held between  September 29 and October 4. Its rival Amazon has also confirmed that it will host its flagship sale event, the 'Great Indian Festival,' during the same period, the report added.
Kalyan Krishnamurthy, group chief executive officer of Flipkart, believes ecommerce can boost consumption and revive economic activity. 
"We start preparing for TBBD months in advance and the aim is to solve the challenges for the long term. Our focus is on adding new customers and enhancing their experience while they are on the platform. The trends we see in TBBD become the new normal during usual business days," said Krishnamurthy, reports the Mint. 
The Walmart-owned platform has recently taken a number of initiatives like adding Hindi language capability, introducing videos to the platform and enhancing the last mile-connectivity. The company has also on-boarded nearly 27,000 Kirana shops across 700 cities to strengthen its pan-India supply chain.

India.com
Mumbai: Amidst growing suspense over the seat-sharing deal between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena for upcoming Maharashtra elections, Shiv Sena leader Shiv Raut Tuesday said that the task of distributing seats between both the parties is tougher than India-Pakistan partition.
However, he asserted that once the decision is taken on the seat-sharing arrangement, it will be conveyed to the media.

“Maharashtra is so huge. This division of 288 seats is more difficult than the partition of India and Pakistan,” Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said.
Sanjay Raut added, “If we were in the opposition instead of being in government, then the picture would have been different. Whatever decision will be taken on seat-sharing will be immediately conveyed to the media.”
Maharashtra BJP Chief Chandrakant Patil confirmed that discussion on the alliance is at the last stage. “Those who are thinking that alliance will not happen are going to be disappointed,” he added.
“I am confident that we will get 220 seats in the upcoming assembly elections,” Patil stated.
This comes amid reports of a rift between the BJP and Shiv Sena over the pre-poll alliance.
Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had earlier exuded confidence on him winning the polls, and retaining his post as the CM. “I am saying with no uncertainty that we will contest the Assembly polls along with Shiv Sena. The seat-sharing talks are still on, do not trust the reports,” Fadnavis had said while speaking at the India Today Conclave.
It must be noted that no formal announcement on the seat-sharing has been made so far, even though, both parties said that the deal will be made known soon.
The alliance was initially set to be announced publicly on or before BJP chief Amit Shah’s Mumbai visit on September 22.
The coalition is likely to use the same strategy as used during by NDA alliance during Lok Sabha polls, and is banking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to draw all votes towards the party with the additional support of the perceived clean image of CM Fadnavis.
Maharashtra will go for a single-phase election on October 21. Counting of votes will take place on October 24.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for trade talks in two weeks. 
“It’s actually, I think, it’s not next week, but the following week we’ll be having those talks,” Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox Business Network, adding that the two country’s negotiators had made some progress in easing their trade tensions in last week’s deputy-level meetings. 
Earlier on Monday Mnuchin had told reporters at the United Nations General Assembly that the trade talks would resume next week.

Times Now
San Francisco: Some Facebook competitors like Snap are reportedly helping the US FTC as it launches an anti-trust investigation into the social networking giant's business practices. According to a Wall Street Journal report on Monday, Snap which is the parent company of Snapchat, has created a dossier under "Project Voldemort" that apparently contains Facebook secrets.
"The files in 'Project Voldemort' chronicled Facebook's moves that threatened to undermine Snap's business, including discouraging popular account holders, or influencers, from referencing Snap on their Instagram accounts," the report claimed. Snap and Facebook share a bitter history, with the latter copying several of Snapchat-first features into its Instagram and other products.
From launching "Camera Effects Platform" to encourage augmented reality (AR) effects -- a move reported by The New York Times as Facebook's "brazen heist" over Snapchat - to adding Snapchat-style "Stories" and camera special effects in all its core social apps: Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, The Mark Zuckerberg-run company has done it all.
It is Snapchat which has popularised animated AR selfie masks and facial filters. Facebook has also added Geostickers to Instagram, offering location-specific tags in two cities (New York City and Jakarta) that users can paste over images. Snapchat launched Geofilters back in 2014.
Originally launched by Snapchat, the "Stories" feature shows photos and videos shared in chronological order that disappear after 24 hours. Facebook introduced something similar in its app Instagram. Today, Messenger, WhatsApp and the main Facebook app have all added "Stories" feature (In WhatsApp, it is called 'Status').
According to the WSJ, the FTC has made contact with dozens of tech executives and app developers. In a historic judgment, the US FTC in July slapped a massive $5 billion fine on Facebook over users' privacy violations in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, along with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) directing the social networking platform to pay $100 million penalty for making misleading disclosures regarding the risk of misuse of user data.
Democrat Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon is even demanding jail term for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying he should face serious consequences for letting his social media platform misuse consumers' personal data.

TechCrunch
After several months of speculation, Apple  today confirmed that it will be manufacturing the latest version of the Mac Pro in the United States. The move is in keeping with earlier versions of the high-end, pro-focused desktop. In June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would move production of the long-awaited desktop to a plant outside of Shanghai.
Apple didn’t deny the report at the time, instead stating, “Like all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States.”

This week, however, the company reported that manufacturing will be returning to Austin, Texas, using manufacturers from a variety of states, including Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas and Vermont. Suppliers include Intersil and ON Semiconductor.
“The Mac Pro is Apple’s most powerful computer ever and we’re proud to be building it in Austin. We thank the administration for their support enabling this opportunity,” Tim Cook said in a press release. “We believe deeply in the power of American innovation. That’s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the US, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with US suppliers, and we’re going to continue growing here.”

The move is in keeping with Apple’s commitment to invest $350 billion in the States by 2023. The early reports that the company was shifting to Chinese manufacturing was a major sticking point for Trump, who called out Cook and Apple by name in a series of tweets.
“Apple will not be given Tariff wavers, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China,” Trump tweeted in July. “Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!”

Amidst reports of Indian Telecos testing their 5G equipment, communication hardware manufacturer Huawei seems to be running out of patience with regulatory bodies in India. The company has clearly stated that it won’t be investing more capital in its Indian operations if denied approval for their 5G equipment in India. 
The Chinese company’s CEO in India, Jay Chen has stated that the company has made several attempts to get a clearance on rolling out 5G infrastructure with government bodies but have not any official response. 
“You cannot always think, think and think, but make no decision”, said TOI report quoting Chen. Chinese government officials had previously warned about ‘reverse sanctions’ on Indian companies doing business in China if the Indian government blocks Huawei’s 5G rollout in the country. 
Huawei has been facing several regulatory roadblocks related to issues relating of privacy, and data theft after reports of the company embedding snooping software in the source code of its servers were released. 
The steering committee overseeing 5G is looking into Chinese participation in the launch of 5G services in India. The committee had given the go-ahead to Indian telecom operators for their respective 5G trail with an exception for Chinese vendors. 
In a meeting held in June earlier this year committee head, K Vijay Raghavan said that the matter is under deliberation regarding “the pros and cons of working with Chinese vendors”.
Talking about further Chinese investments in India, Chen had previously stated that several potential Chinese investors are closely looking into the Huawei’s treatment by the Indian government before giving the go-ahead for Indian operations.  
Huawei itself has invested about $3.5 billion in India and operates a manufacturing unit in Chennai for production of 2G, 3G and 4G equipment. While the Chinese company has lauded the government for their recent corporate reforms, including a substantial cut in corporate taxes but is unsure about its expansion plans. 
The company has claimed that they’re open to expansion into 5G equipment production and export, but that depends if they’re allowed to participate in the domestic operations of 5G network as well.

A gang rape survivor in Uttar Pradesh’s Azamgarh district has allegedly been barred by the principal of her school from attending classes, reports The Indian Express. The district magistrate has ordered a probe into the school’s decision.
The girl was abducted by two men in an SUV on her way to the school on Thursday. An FIR was registered three days later. Police on Monday arrested two men for the sexual assault.

Meanwhile, the school principal denied the allegations and claimed he only wanted the girl to stay home for a few days until the matter is resolved.
Asked about the probe, SDM Priyanka had earlier said that the principal had also failed to provide an attendance register, reported the Express.
“I will visit the school on Tuesday. We have given the principal an ultimatum to produce the register and all relevant documents. The claim that it is just a coaching centre and not a school is part of the investigation,” she said.

The New Indian Express
After US President Donald Trump offered to mediate in Kashmir issue for the third time, in presence of Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Monday, a senior Indian diplomat refused to comment on the matter and Trump's description of the Prime Minister Modi's statement in Houston as "very aggressive".
The MEA also urged the media to wait till Tuesday, when Trump and PM Modi meet for bilateral talks in New York.
"There is a meeting tomorrow (Tuesday) between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump. So let us wait for the meeting," Secretary (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs A Gitesh Sarma told a press briefing in New York on Monday in response to a question on the US president's remarks on Modi's statements and his offer again for mediation.
Responding to a similar query on Trump's offer to mediate, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar referred to Sarma's response that one should wait for Tuesday's bilateral meeting.
"The Secretary's response (to wait for the bilateral meeting) is after giving some thought. You know, you are aware about our position, we have mentioned about this in the past. But my request is just hold on. Just hold on for the meeting tomorrow. I think it's not very far," Kumar said.
In less than two days after the Howdy Modi event in Houston, Trump and Modi will meet again for bilateral talks Tuesday following Trump's address to the UN General Debate.
Describing himself as "an extremely good arbitrator", Trump again brought back the 'mediation' card on Monday by saying that he can only intervene on the Kashmir issue if India and Pakistan agree on that.
Trump made the remarks during his meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York.
"If I can help, I will certainly help," Trump said, describing the Kashmir issue as a "complex" one which has been going on for a long time.

"If both (Pakistan and India) want, I am ready to do it," he said, a day after attending 'Howdy, Modi' rally in Houston, where he shared the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and displayed a close friendship and a common vision on fighting terrorism.
"At any point of time, I would be an extremely good arbitrator," he said.
Trump praised the 'Howdy, Modi' mega rally in presence of Khan and said he has heard a "very aggressive statement" by Prime Minister Modi.
On Monday, Trump praised the 'Howdy, Modi' mega rally in the presence of the Pakistani premier and said he has heard a "very aggressive statement" by Prime Minister Modi at the mega rally.
"I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday. I was there. I didn't know I was going to hear that statement. But I was sitting there. And I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday, from India, from the prime minister," Trump said.
However, at the same time, he said the statement was "very well received within the room" "And I will say it was very well received within the room, the statement itself.
"That was a big room, 59,000 people. But it was a very aggressive statement. And I hope that they're going to be able to come together, India and Pakistan, and do something that's really smart and good for both. And I'm sure that. there's always a solution. And I really believe there's a solution to that," Trump said, while referring to the gathering of 50,000 people at the NRG Stadium in Houston.
At the rally on Sunday, Modi hit out at Pakistan for its support to terrorism and said India's decision to nullify Article 370 has caused trouble to those who cannot handle their country as he called for a "decisive battle" against terrorism.
Prime Minister Khan, who has declared himself an ambassador of Kashmiris, on Sunday briefed US lawmakers, scholars, human rights activists and the media on the repercussions of India revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5.
Trump and Imran last met in July at the White House.
During their first one-on-one interaction, the US president had expressed his willingness to mediate between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue - an offer India rejected.
During Modi's meeting with President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in France last month, the prime minister categorically rejected any scope for third party mediation between India and Pakistan on Kashmir.
"All the issues between India and Pakistan are of bilateral in nature, and we don't want to trouble any third country. We can discuss and resolve these issues bilaterally," Modi had said.
On his part, Trump had said he and Modi spoke about Kashmir "at great length" during the G7 Summit and he feels that both India and Pakistan can resolve it on their own.
His comments on Kashmir in the French city of Biarritz was seen as apparent backtracking from his earlier comments, offering mediation.
Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.
India's action evoked strong reactions from Pakistan which downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian Ambassador.
Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its "internal matter".
New Delhi has also asked Islamabad to accept reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric.

Times Now
Washington: American actor Pamela Anderson believes that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been psychologically tortured in prison.
The 52-year-old star appeared on Good Morning Britain on Monday, where she advocated for Assange's asylum, reported Fox News.
"He was right seeking asylum because everything he said was going to happen, happened," Anderson said.
Assange was arrested at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in April after Ecuador withdrew his asylum.
He was charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for aiding Chelsea Manning in the cracking of a password to a classified U.S. government computer in 2010, the U.S. Justice Department announced, reported Fox News.
Since the arrest of Assange, Anderson has visited him in prison multiple times.
"He's just a fantastic guy," she said. "I saw him, he hugged me and picked me up off the ground. He's still this testament of human spirit."
When asked what the visit was like, she replied, "I went to visit him in prison. That's not somewhere you want to leave a dear friend. I care a great deal about Julian. I think he has been psychologically tortured."
"I just want people to understand that this is a good person who has dedicated himself to telling the truth to the public, which we deserve to know," she said. "Exposing war crimes and the people he's exposed haven't faced any penalty. But he's sitting in prison because there are obviously more stories to keep."

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: The day is not far when Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) will be a part of India, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Monday.
The decision to abrogate Article 370 provisions was taken to restore the position of Jammu and Kashmir as it was when handed over by its last ruler Maharaja Hari Singh, he said.
On August 5, the central government ended the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under the article and bifurcated it into Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, which will come into being on October 31.
"The abrogation of Article 370 will benefit the common man of Jammu and Kashmir, ending their exploitation. The day is not far when the PoK will be a part of India," he said at an event to mark the birth anniversary of Maharaja Hari Singh here.
Singh said the day, the provisions that gave special status to the state were abrogated, was a day of redemption, resurgence and rejuvenation.
This day has come due to the long and selfless journey by some people who made untiring efforts in this direction, he said.
The minister said the whole nation is celebrating this decisive move by the Modi government.
"There has been no curfew, no incidence of violence since the decision has been taken. Some restrictions are there to avoid any disturbance by anti-social elements," he said.
Singh said the common man of the Kashmir valley is happy with the decision of the government and this has ended their exploitation.
He said many rules applicable to other parts of the country will now be applicable to Jammu and Kashmir, specially rules concerning central government employees.
Singh said Maharaja Hari Singh was a true patriot and a visionary. History needs to be kind to him and his contribution needs to be seen in the right perspective, he said.
Maharaja Hari Singh has been denied the right place in history. Now, the dream of the Maharaja is fulfilled with this bold decision of the government, he said.
The last ruler of Jammu and Kashmir will be remembered for his agricultural reforms and making primary education compulsory in 1930, Singh said.
The Maharaja won the confidence of the people of the Kashmir Valley, due to his effective handling of the acute food shortage in 1921-22 and he also took many steps to remove gender-biased practices, the minister said.

ANI
New York [USA], Sept 23 (ANI): Pakistan's envoy to the United Nations, Maleeha Lodhi still believes that Boris Johnson is the Foreign Minister of UK even as he's ascended the career leader to lead Britain as its Prime Minister.Embarrassing her country, yet again, Lodhi tweeted, "Prime Minister Imran Khan met British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson this morning," attaching a picture of the Pakistani leader sitting with the British PM on Monday.She's known to cause embarrassments for Pakistan at the United Nations, previously trying to pass off a picture of a 17-year-old Palestinian girl with pellet injuries on her face as 'evidence' of atrocities on Kashmiris in India. Lodhi had made the goof-up in her right to reply to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj's speech at the UN in 2017.Her goof-up was strongly rebuked by India who lambasted the neighbour for using a fake picture to establish a false narrative.The Palestinian girl's picture was taken by award-winning photographer Heidi Levine, who also criticised the Pakistani diplomat's erroneous ways as being "unfair for the dignity of Rawya (the injured Palestinean girl) who is still struggling to overcome her injuries," while speaking to ANI.Recognising her mistake, Lodhi on Monday deleted her inaccurate tweet and apologised for her gaffe.

(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Monday it bought New York-based CTRL-labs, a start-up that is exploring ways for people to communicate with computers using brain signals, in a deal that CNBC said was valued at $1 billion. 
Facebook Vice President of AR/VR Andrew Bosworth announced the deal in a Facebook post.  
CTRL-labs will join Facebook Reality Labs team, Bosworth said, without giving any financial details. 
Facebook said it intends to use the neural interface technology of CTRL-labs in developing a wristband that connects to other devices intuitively.  
“The vision for this work is a wristband that lets people control their devices as a natural extension of movement,” Bosworth said.  
“We hope to build this kind of technology, at scale, and get it into consumer products faster,” he added. 
Media reports said CTRL-labs is working with brain science and machine learning to create interfaces for people to control and manipulate computers by thinking. Its development-stage wrist-worn device uses sensors to track gestures and would act as an input device. 
The deal is valued at about $1 billion, CNBC reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. cnb.cx/2mbg1bk 
Facebook was not immediately available for comment on the deal value.

Google has announced that it will do more to protect user privacy for its Google Assistant and confirmed that it doesn't save voice recordings by default. The news comes after revelations that a Google contractor was leaking private user audio recordings meant to improve its translation service. "It's clear that we fell short of our high standards in making it easy for you to understand how your data is used, and we apologize," wrote the company wrote in a blog post.
Google isn't alone in misusing voice data, as both Amazon and Apple recently confirmed that they were saving Alexa and Siri conversations in an attempt to improve their AI algorithms. Apple suspended the program last month and then promised to resume it using computer-generated transcripts, but only if users opt in. Amazon, meanwhile, said that it will still do select voice recording by default, but allow users to opt out.
Google paused its human audio review in July, but said it will resume with new safeguards in place. "By default, we don't retain your audio recordings," it wrote. "This has been the case, and will remain unchanged."
We're updating our policy to vastly reduce the amount of audio data we store. For those of you who have opted in to VAA, we will soon automatically delete the vast majority of audio data associated with your account that's older than a few months. This new policy will be coming to VAA later this year.
What's changing is that if you have opted in, Google will prompt you to review your settings choice under the "Voice & Audio Activity" parameter. The company has also tried to improve filters that are supposed to erase voice recordings made in error when the user hasn't said "OK Google" or other wake words. It will also soon launch a new feature that allows you to select how sensitive the Assistant is to your wake word to avoid accidental activation.
By the end of the year, Google will "vastly reduce" how much audio data it stores, the company said. If you opt in to allow it to save your voice data, it will delete the majority of it after a few months. "One of the principles we strive toward is minimizing the amount of data we store, and we're applying this to the Google Assistant as well," according to the post.
You'll still have to be careful across all your assistants that your voice data is being used how you want. At least now, more people are becoming aware, and if you want, you should be able to turn off -- or at least limit -- one of the microphones that listens intently to your every word.

The White House
InterContinental New York Barclay
New York, New York
1:05 P.M. EDT
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to be with my friend, the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  And we have some great discussions going on with Pakistan about a lot of things, including the Taliban and Afghanistan, and many other things.  And trade, I think, maybe is one of the most important.  We’re going to increase trade with Pakistan by a tremendous margin.
We do a very small amount of trade with them, and they want to do a large, and so do we.  And we should be able to do that, I think, Wilbur, very easily.  So we’re going to double, triple, quadruple the trade.  It will be very easy to do.  They make great product, and so do we.
And I was really shocked when I saw the original numbers from last year and the year before, and for many years, that the trade with Pakistan isn’t much greater.  But it could be many times the number.
So we’ll be talking about trade and other things.  And it’s an honor to be with you.  Thank you very much.  Please.
PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I look forward, Mr. President, to talk to you about, obviously, Afghanistan, which is a big issue for us Pakistanis, because stability in Afghanistan means stability in Pakistan.  We also want to talk about all three neighbors: Afghanistan, India, Kashmir.  And, of course, Iran, it’s just — we will discuss the situation there because all — these all three neighbors of Pakistan.  And I —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He lives in a very friendly neighborhood.  (Laughter.)
PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I mean, as if there are not already enough challenges.
Q    Mr. President, after your last meeting with the Prime Minister, you offered to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.  And since then, the situation has gotten more complicated, and India continues to deny our access in the region.  So where does the offer stand now on (inaudible)?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It would always stand.  If I can help, I would certainly do that.  And it will be dependent on both of these gentlemen.  One without the other doesn’t work, if you’re going to do mediation or if you’re going to do an arbitration.
But certainly, I would be willing to help if both wanted.  If both Pakistan, let’s say, and India wanted me to do that, I am ready, willing, and able.  It’s a complex issue.  It’s been going on for a long time.  But if both wanted it, I would be ready to do it.
Q    Mr. President, with all the things — reverting back to my question in the Oval Office on Kashmir —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.
Q    — you know, the thing is, you are asking both the parties to accept and one is aggressor, (inaudible) these U.N. resolutions.  And that’s non-compliant, plus — you know, merging Kashmir into its own territory.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  This is the kind of reporter I like.
Q    Which is (inaudible) U.N. resolution.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I like this reporter.  (Laughter.)
Q    And how can you —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you a member of this team?  Or are you a —
Q    I’m a member of — I’m not a member of this team.  I’m an independent journalist.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You know what?  You’re saying — you’re saying what you think.
Q    No, let me complete my question, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, but I have to be requesting —
Q    How can you make —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.
Q    — an aggressor and a (inaudible) meet and —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s okay.  I understand.
Q    — in violation of the U.N. resolutions?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very fair question, or statement.  I’ll — let me put that one down as a statement, if you don’t mind.
Q    Thank you.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But you’re right, you have to have a — they have to have two parties that want to agree.  And if they — when they come — and, at some point, India may come.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan.
And if at any time they say, “You know, we have some points that we think we can maybe iron out,” I think I’d be an extremely good arbitrator.  I’ve done it before, believe it or not, and I’ve never failed as an arbitrator.  I’ve been asked to arbitrate disputes — pretty big ones — from friends.  And I’ve done it in a good, successful fashion.
If I can be of help — you know that — if I can be of help, let me know.  But you’d have to have the assent also from the other side.
Q    Prime Minister Johnson has now called for a new deal, just moments ago — for a new Iran deal.  This is the first time he’s called for that.  I wonder what your reaction to it.  And have you discussed that with him previously?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think that’s why he’s a winner.  That’s why he’s a man that’s going to be successful in the UK.  And I think that’s great.  You’re talking about Boris, right?
Q    Yes, talking about Boris, sir.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Boris is a man who — number one, he’s a friend of mine, and, number two, he’s very smart, very tough.  And he does want a new deal because the other deal was ready to expire.  It was at a very short number of years left.  All that money paid and wasted.  You didn’t have the right to inspect the appropriate sites.  You were looking at sites that would never be used to create nuclear.  The sites that they would use, we weren’t allowed to inspect.  What kind of a deal is that?  And ballistic missiles — they’re allowed to test ballistic missiles and other things.
But one of the biggest things is the fact that the agreement is going to expire in a very short number of years.  And what kind of a deal is that?  We’re dealing with countries.  You have to go long term.
So, I respect Boris a lot, and I am not at all surprised that he was the first one to come out and say that.
Q    Mr. President, this is the first time — (inaudible) from (inaudible) Pakistan.  So this is the first time we get honest leadership like you in America.  And in past —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree with that.  This is the first time you’ve had honesty.
Q    Sir, in past —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You’ve had a lot of dishonesty, and they’ve treated Pakistan very badly.  The people in my position have treated Pakistan very badly.  I think that — I wouldn’t say Pakistan has treated us too well either, but maybe there was a reason.  And, in fact, I think there was a reason for it.
Q    Sir, in past, you have said that you don’t trust Pakistan.  So, when we have honest (inaudible) —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I trust Pakistan.  But people before me didn’t, but they didn’t know what they were doing.  So it’s just one of those little problems in life.
You know, I — you know what I do?  I trust this gentleman right here.  And I do trust Pakistan.  I know — I have a lot of Pakistani friends living in New York.  They’re smart.  Great negotiators, by the way, in case you had any questions.  They’re among the toughest negotiators in the world.
And, you know what?  It’s all going to work out.  But if I can help, I’d like to help.  But I don’t think you’ve ever had a President that felt the way I do, in a positive way, about Pakistan.  I don’t think you have.  I’ve looked back, and I’ve seen where it was.  And — and — but I also have a very good relationship with India.  I have a good relationship with both.
So, if they decide to use that feeling among both, I think we can help out.  But this has been a longstanding — this has been going on for a long time.
Q    Mr. President, yesterday you shared the stage with PM Modi.  He alleged that Pakistan is the hub of terrorism.  Do you endorse that or do you disagree with that?  Because you said that Pakistan has made a lot of progress.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I really have been pointing much more to Iran.  I mean, Iran if you look at what, that’s been really the state of terror.  And I’ve been saying it’s the number one state of terror in the world.  And the agreement we had does not cover that.  It was not doing well.  It was doing very poorly.  And now Iran is doing very poorly.  Iran is a different place than when I took over.
When I took over the United States — when I became President — Iran was a real threat to the entire Middle East and maybe beyond.  And now they’re having very, very big difficulties, to put it mildly.  So we’ll see.
Q    Are you happy with the progress that Pakistan has made countering terrorism, particularly eliminating terrorism (inaudible)?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’ve heard they’ve made great progress.  And under this leader — he’s a great leader — I think he wants to make great progress because there’s no solution the other way.  The other way is only going to lead to death and chaos and poverty.  It’s all it’s going to lead to.  I mean, he understands it.  Your Prime Minister understands it.
Q    Are you concerned about the human rights situation in Kashmir?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  About which?
Q    Human rights situation — human rights violations.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Sure.  I’d like to see everything work out.  I want it to be humane.  I want everybody to be treated well.  You have two big countries, and they’re warring countries and they’ve been fighting.
And — I mean, I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday.  I don’t have to say that.  I was there.  I didn’t know I was going to hear that statement, I had said.  But I was sitting there and I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday from India, from the Prime Minister, and I will say it was very well received within the rule — you know, within in the room.  The statement itself.  That was a big room; there were 59,000 people.
But it was a very aggressive statement, and I hope that they’re going to be able to come together — India and Pakistan — and do something that’s really smart and good for both.  And I’m sure there could be — there’s always a solution.  And I really believe there’s a solution for that.
(Cross-talk.)
Easy.  Easy.  You’ve asked one already.  Go ahead.  Quickly.  Make a one-second statement.  Go ahead, make a statement.
Q    Now, if you can solve this outstanding issue of Kashmir —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.
Q    — very likely and definitely you will be deserving a Nobel Prize on that.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think I’ll get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things.  I think I’m going to get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they gave it out fairly, which they don’t.
They gave it out — well, they gave one to Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it.  And you know what?  That was the only thing I agreed with him on.
(Cross-talk.)
Come on.
Q    Other than Pakistan and India, the Kashmiri people are suffering the last 50 days.  They will talk later on, but right now there was human rights violation in Kashmir.  Fifty days lockdown — no Internet, no food, nothing.  So, you know, what do you want do for the Kashmiri people?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Where do you find reporters like this?  (Laughter.)  These guys are fantastic.
All right, go ahead.
(Cross-talk.)
Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  He’s talking.  Let the American talk for a change.
Q    Thank you, sir.  Have talks with the Taliban resumed in any way?  And have you looked to Pakistan leaders to help you in any way —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, we’ve hit the Taliban very hard.
Q    — with assistance in Afghanistan.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, I have.  And I think that the Pakistan — I think Pakistan will be a great help.  I know the Prime Minister wants to be a help.  But we’ve hit the Taliban harder than we’ve ever hit them — in all of the years.  I guess we’ve been there now 19 years.  How ridiculous is that?  And when they killed 12 people — one of them an American soldier, as you know, and one a United Nations solider — for the sake of going into the meeting with a little strength, they thought.  They went in with weakness.  And I cancelled everything.  We have hit them harder in the last two weeks than we’ve ever hit them before.
Q    When do you think talks could resume again, sir?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll see what happens.  But I will say that the Prime Minister has been very helpful and he wants to do something.  He wants to see something happen.  So, that’s fine.
Q    My question is on Pakistan.  Mr. Prime Minister, would you like to raise the issue of curfew and lockdown, and the atrocities in Kashmir before the President of America?
PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  You know, Mr. President, I was going to raise it in private, but it needs to be said that, for 50 days, 8 million people are under siege by 900,000 troops.  And it’s a humanitarian issue.  And so I was going to say that — were you supposed to meet Narendra Modi now, I would’ve asked you to at least lift the siege.  I mean, it’s a huge humanitarian crisis taking place.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, so we’re going to talking about that in a little while.
PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  We’ll discuss that.
Q    Mr. Prime Minister, what are your expectations from American President about the Kashmir issue?
PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  My expectations: President Trump heads the most powerful country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world has a responsibility.  And, you know, you very kindly want to mediate this and you also said that to do both, first  India and Pakistan has to agree to mediation.
But, unfortunately, India is refusing to talk to us.  So, in this situation, I feel that this is the beginning of a crisis.  I honestly feel that this crisis is going to get much bigger — what is happening in Kashmir.  So we would like to talk about that later.
But just the fact that the position of the United States — it’s the most powerful country.  It can affect the United Nations Security Council.  It has a voice.  So we look to the U.S. to put out flames in the world.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And I will say this: Look, I have my respect for your Prime Minister, I will say that many countries wanted to meet with me and us — the United States — during this very short three-day period, and we were unable to meet with many of them.  One of the countries I wanted to meet with was Pakistan and your Prime Minister.  And it’s an honor to be here with you.  And I think you should let us start talking now because —
PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  Thank you.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  — but I do appreciate it.  There’s a tremendous spirit from your press.  I don’t see that.  With us, they want to always tear our country down.  And with your press, it’s really — they would like to see something positive for your country.
And I will tell you this: You have a great leader.  And he’s a good man.  He’s a nice man.  Happens to be a great athlete — not that that matters, but it’s always nice.
Q    You are a great leader, too, sir.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  You take care of yourselves.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks everybody.

InterContinental New York Barclay
New York, New York
1:05 P.M. EDT
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to be with my friend, the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  And we have some great discussions going on with Pakistan about a lot of things, including the Taliban and Afghanistan, and many other things.  And trade, I think, maybe is one of the most important.  We’re going to increase trade with Pakistan by a tremendous margin.
We do a very small amount of trade with them, and they want to do a large, and so do we.  And we should be able to do that, I think, Wilbur, very easily.  So we’re going to double, triple, quadruple the trade.  It will be very easy to do.  They make great product, and so do we.
And I was really shocked when I saw the original numbers from last year and the year before, and for many years, that the trade with Pakistan isn’t much greater.  But it could be many times the number.
So we’ll be talking about trade and other things.  And it’s an honor to be with you.  Thank you very much.  Please.
PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I look forward, Mr. President, to talk to you about, obviously, Afghanistan, which is a big issue for us Pakistanis, because stability in Afghanistan means stability in Pakistan.  We also want to talk about all three neighbors: Afghanistan, India, Kashmir.  And, of course, Iran, it’s just — we will discuss the situation there because all — these all three neighbors of Pakistan.  And I —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He lives in a very friendly neighborhood.  (Laughter.)
PRIME MINISTER KHAN:  I mean, as if there are not already enough challenges.
Q    Mr. President, after your last meeting with the Prime Minister, you offered to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.  And since then, the situation has gotten more complicated, and India continues to deny our access in the region.  So where does the offer stand now on (inaudible)?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It would always stand.  If I can help, I would certainly do that.  And it will be dependent on both of these gentlemen.  One without the other doesn’t work, if you’re going to do mediation or if you’re going to do an arbitration.
But certainly, I would be willing to help if both wanted.  If both Pakistan, let’s say, and India wanted me to do that, I am ready, willing, and able.  It’s a complex issue.  It’s been going on for a long time.  But if both wanted it, I would be ready to do it.
Q    Mr. President, with all the things — reverting back to my question in the Oval Office on Kashmir —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.
Q    — you know, the thing is, you are asking both the parties to accept and one is aggressor, (inaudible) these U.N. resolutions.  And that’s non-compliant, plus — you know, merging Kashmir into its own territory.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  This is the kind of reporter I like.
Q    Which is (inaudible) U.N. resolution.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I like this reporter.  (Laughter.)
Q    And how can you —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you a member of this team?  Or are you a —
Q    I’m a member of — I’m not a member of this team.  I’m an independent journalist.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You know what?  You’re saying — you’re saying what you think.
Q    No, let me complete my question, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, but I have to be requesting —
Q    How can you make —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.
Q    — an aggressor and a (inaudible) meet and —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s okay.  I understand.
Q    — in violation of the U.N. resolutions?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very fair question, or statement.  I’ll — let me put that one down as a statement, if you don’t mind.
Q    Thank you.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  But you’re right, you have to have a — they have to have two parties that want to agree.  And if they — when they come — and, at some point, India may come.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi.  I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan.
And if at any time they say, “You know, we have some points that we think we can maybe iron out,” I think I’d be an extremely good arbitrator.  I’ve done it before, believe it or not, and I’ve never failed as an arbitrator.  I’ve been asked to arbitrate disputes — pretty big ones — from friends.  And I’ve done it in a good, successful fashion.
If I can be of help — you know that — if I can be of help, let me know.  But you’d have to have the assent also from the other side.
Q    Prime Minister Johnson has now called for a new deal, just moments ago — for a new Iran deal.  This is the first time he’s called for that.  I wonder what your reaction to it.  And have you discussed that with him previously?
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think that’s why he’s a winner.  That’s why he’s a man that’s going to be successful in the UK.  And I think that’s great.  You’re talking about Boris, right?
Q    Yes, talking about Boris, sir.
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Boris is a man who — number one, he’s a friend of mine, and, number two, he’s very smart, very tough.  And he does want a new deal because the other deal was ready to expire.  It was at a very short number of years left.  All that money paid and wasted.  You didn’t have the right to inspect the appropriate sites.  You were looking at sites that would never be used to create nuclear.  The sites that they would use, we weren’t allowed to inspect.  What kind of a deal is that?  And ballistic missiles — they’re allowed to test ballistic missiles and other things.
But one of the biggest things is the fact that the agreement is going to expire in a very short number of years.  And what kind of a deal is that?  We’re dealing with countries.  You have to go long term.
So, I respect Boris a lot, and I am not at all surprised that he was the first one to come out and say that.
Q    Mr. President, this is the first time — (inaudible) from (inaudible) Pakistan.  So this is the first time we get honest leadership like you in America.  And in past —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree with that.  This is the first time you’ve had honesty.
Q    Sir, in past —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You’ve had a lot of dishonesty, and they’ve treated Pakistan very badly.  The people in my position have treated Pakistan very badly.  I think that — I wouldn’t say Pakistan has treated us too well either, but maybe there was a reason.  And, in fact, I think there was a reason for it.
Q    Sir, in past, you have said that you don’t trust Pakistan.  So, when we have honest (inaudible) —
PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I trust Pakistan.  But people before me didn’t, but they didn’t know what they were doing.  So it’s just one of those little problems in life.
You know, I — you know what I do?  I trust this gentleman right here.  And I do trust Pakistan.  I know — I have a lot of Pakistani friends living in New York.  They’re smart.  Great negotiators, by the way, in case you had any questions.  They’re among the toughest negotiators in the world.
And, you know what?  It’s all going to work out.  But if I can help, I’d like to help.  But I don’t think you’ve ever had a President that felt the way I do, in a positive way, about Pakistan.  I don’t think you have.  I’ve looked back, and I’ve seen where it was.  And — and — but I also have a very good relationship with India.  I have a good relationship with both.

India.com
New Delhi: It would be difficult to question the faith of Hindus with regard to Ayodhya as the birthplace of Lord Ram as even some Muslim witnesses have termed it as sacred for the Hindus as Mecca is for them, the Supreme Court said Monday.
A 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi was questioning senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the Muslim parties, on whether the divinity and the “exact form” of an idol or a deity were necessary to hold that they have “juristic personality”.
“Even Muslim witnesses (during the trial) have said that Ayodhya to Hindus is as sacred as the Mecca is for them. It will be difficult to rebut the belief of the Hindus,” said the bench which also comprised Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S A Nazeer.
Dhavan, arguing for Sunni Waqf Board and others including original litigant M Siddiq, said that only belief cannot be the basis to claim title and accord juristic status to the ‘janmsthan’ (birth place).
He, however, strongly pitched for granting respect to Lord Ram and the Allah in a diverse country like India on the 29th day of the hearing in the politically sensitive case.
“If Lord Ram and Allah are not respected then this great nation will split apart,” said the senior lawyer but strongly objected to the move to make the birthplace as a party to the lawsuit filed on behalf of deity ‘Ram Lalla Viarajman’ for claiming juristic status for the sacred land.
At the outset, Dhavan tried to distinguish between the legal status of the deity and the birth place and said that the latter has been made a party with a sole aim to make a Ram temple at the site and to ensure that impediments such as law of limitation, adverse possession and acquisition do not come in the way.
“They just say Lord Ram was born here. None of the contours of the area are mentioned anywhere in the plaint. The suit is thus merely a vehicle to destroy and build a temple.
“They have argued that all existing structures be demolished at Ram Janmabhoomi and a new Temple be constructed there,” he said.
The bench referred to vehement submissions of Dhavan that belief is a very “tenuous” evidence and the Hindus should establish the long worship instead.
“Your (Dhavan’s) first claim is that belief is tenuous as an evidence. But your second argument is that belief should be manifested by way of an object. What exactly is the object you are talking about,” the bench asked.
“Is it necessary for a deity or an idol to have divinity so as to make it a juristic personality”.
The senior lawyer said there should be “some” kind of physical manifestation of a deity or an idol and even if we concede to Hindus’ belief, then where are the “objective” aspects to support it.
The bench also asked Dhavan to provide a list of deities or idols which, as per earlier judgements, have been granted status of juristic personalities. He, however, expressed inability to do so saying that he will have to write 18 research papers for doing it.
“Assume that it (land) is the juristic personality and then what will be the consequences. Even assume that it does not have the juristic personality, then what will be the consequences,” the bench asked, added whether same logic would apply in the case of public Muslim graveyards.
“The dedication and the long use are the two criteria. A public wakf can be created on these two grounds,” Dhavan said.
He said that in the present case, the issue was whether the belief can be attached to an area to make a “vague” title claim and can it be said that the mosque was illegal just because it was built on ‘janmbhoomi’.
He asked the bench to lift the veil to see whether the birthplace can be treated as juristic person and reiterated his submissions that Hindus never had the access to the inner courtyard and they were praying at ‘Ram Chabutara’ in outer courtyard.
He rebutted the submissions that the lawsuit filed by the Sunni Wakf Board on December 18, 1961, was barred by limitation and said that the cause of action, if any, to file the case arose only on the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949 when the idols were allegedly placed below the central dome.
Dhavan also opposed the plea of some Hindu parties that they acquired title over the site on account of legal doctrine of “adverse possession” and said it presupposes the fact that the Muslims were the legal owner and Hindus were having “adverse possession” of the place.
“There was no idol in the inner area till 1949 and the mosque was never an abandoned mosque at any point of time. It might have, at best, been unused for some time. That is their (the Hindus’) best case,” he said.
Dhavan then summarised his rebuttal to the lawsuit filed on behalf of the deity.
“The entire argument was based on belief from scattered sources such as Travellers accounts and Gazetteers which have been found to be inconsistent and inconclusive,” he said.
The bench will resume hearing on Tuesday.
The Allahabad High Court, in its judgment of 2010 on four civil lawsuits, had partitioned the 2.77-acre disputed land equally among Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. Fourteen appeals have been filed in the Supreme Court against the verdict.

Reuters
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Britain, Germany and France backed the United States and blamed Iran on Monday for an attack on Saudi oil facilities, urging Tehran to agree to new talks with world powers on its nuclear and missile programs and regional security issues. 
The Europeans issued a joint statement after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron met at the United Nations on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders.  
But Iran ruled out the possibility of negotiating a new deal with powers, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Monday, saying European partners have failed to fulfill their commitments under a 2015 nuclear pact. 
European leaders have struggled to defuse a brewing confrontation between Tehran and Washington since U.S. President Donald Trump quit a deal last year that assures Iran access to world trade in return for curbs on its nuclear program. 
The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran and sharply tightened them. Iran has responded by gradually breaching nuclear commitments made in the 2015 accord and has set an October deadline to further scale back its nuclear obligations unless the Europeans salvage the pact by shielding Tehran’s economy from U.S. penalties.  
“The time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear program as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles program and other means of delivery,” Britain, France and Germany said.   
Tension rose on Sept. 14 following an attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities, which Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran. Tehran denies responsibility, and Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition, has said it carried out the attack.  
“It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,” Britain, France and Germany said.  
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked the European nations for their statement blaming Iran, saying, “This will strengthen diplomacy and the cause of peace.” 
Macron has led a European push over the summer to find a compromise between the United States and Iran and wants to use the U.N. meeting as an opportunity to revive diplomacy, though his efforts have stalled in recent weeks. 
When asked about Macron’s attempt to mediate, U.S. President Donald Trump said: “We don’t need a mediator. ... They (Iran) know who to call.” 
The United States will intensify pressure on Iran, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Brian Hook said in New York on Monday. 
The United States was seeking to address the issue through diplomacy and a multilateral effort, and there was a role for the United Nations Security Council to play, Hook said without elaborating. 
In an interview with U.S. network NBC on Monday, Johnson said Trump was “the one guy who can do a better deal. ... I hope there will be a Trump deal.” 
Trump flirted with meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while both are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, but the chances appear slim.    
“We haven’t received any requests this time, yet, for a meeting and we have made it clear a request alone will not do the job,” Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif told reporters in New York earlier on Monday. “A negotiation has to be for a reason, for an outcome, not just for a handshake.”  
He said there are conditions for a meeting - Iran has demanded the United States lift sanctions - and then there could be a meeting between Iran, the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China - the original parties to the nuclear deal - but there would be no bilateral meeting. 
Speaking after he arrived in New York on Monday, Rouhani said Iran’s message to the world “is peace, stability and also we want to tell the world that the situation in the Persian Gulf is very sensitive,” the state news agency IRNA reported.  
Trump has criticized the nuclear accord, negotiated under then-U.S. President Barack Obama, for “sunset” clauses by which some of its provisions will expire as well as for its failure to address Iran’s missile program and regional activities.  
A senior Gulf official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gulf countries, the United States, the Europeans and others needed to engage in “collective diplomacy” to defuse tensions. 
“The conversation should no longer be about the JCPOA (nuclear deal) but Iran’s missile program and its regional misbehavior, which are as important if not more important - they have the potential to hold the region to ransom,” the official said.

Times Now
A year later, Meghan Markle continues to be in the eye of the storm. Although royal observers were ecstatic when the news of Prince Harry's engagement with Meghan first broke, the Duchess of Sussex has found herself amidst a lot of hate. From dissing her fashion choices to blaming her for causing a rift between Prince William and Harry, multiple rumours have been doing the rounds and the world is split into pro-Meghan and anti-Meghan. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have arrived in Africa for their 10-day tour along with little Archie. 
The royals have kickstarted their trip by visiting Nyanga, outside of Cape Town where 206 people are killed each year. The Sussexes danced and knelt down to shake their hands with the youngsters. After joining the traditional hug and sharing warm hugs with a shy schoolboy, Meghan went on to address the gathering and shared the warmest words with everyone out there. 
Speaking about young women who've benefitted from a female empowerment programme, Meghan adds “While I'm here with my husband as a member of the royal family, I want you to know from me I am here with you as a mother, as a wife, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For her first official engagement, Meghan opted for a simple yet pretty black dress by Mayamiko and teamed it with black tie-up wedges by Castaner. Pulling her hair back into a simple ponytail, Meghan looked pretty with a thin stroke of eyeliner and pink lips. 
Meghan arrived in Africa with an ear-to-ear smile as she held her little son close to her.

Times Now
Lata Mangeshkar turns 90 on September 28. The playback legend opened up in an exclusive chat.
Q: It is that time of the year again?
Lata: You mean my birthday? What's so special about it? It's like any other day, isn't it?
Q: No Didi. I would say it is the day the most gifted singer of civilisation was born.
Lata: Aap aisa sochte hain yeh aapka badappan hai (if you think this way it's your greatness). I've never thought of myself as special.
Q: Some of the world's greatest artistes, statesmen and connoisseurs of music have declared you the greatest ever...
Lata: I never thought of myself as special even when those who have heard and appreciated my singing said I was. For me, the constant effort in life has been to better myself as a person and an artiste.
Q: Javed Akhtar says your singing epitomises perfection. How can you improve on perfection?
Lata: Oh, there are so many of my songs that are considered flawless but are actually flawed. I can hear those flaws that you can't. And believe me, I cringe every time I hear those flaws in my singing.
Q: Can you point out some of your flawed' songs?
Lata: No, why should I? Don't you prefer to keep believing that they are flawless?
Q: You have said you constantly strive to improve yourself as a human being. In what way?
Lata: My biggest personality flaw was my fierce temper. Even as a child I had a major temper issue. I would get angry very quickly. This changed as I grew older. Then there came a time when my temper vanished. Now I don't get angry at all. I sometimes wonder what happened to my fierce temper.
Q: In spite of your incomparable talent and success I've always seen you as being humble. How did you manage to remain unaffected by your phenomenal success?
Lata: I have always been like that. I was taught by my parents to forgive and forget when wronged by anyone. I've tried to follow that.
Q: Didi, I know of so many who have taken advantage of your generous and forgiving nature...
Lata: God bless them. I've never been vain or arrogant about my abilities, because I feel if I can sing well it is a gift that I've got from God and my parents. I always treated my singing as a special privilege. I nurtured it as a privilege.
Q: What advice would you give to upcoming aspiring singers?
Lata: Riyaaz (practice). Every singer who is serious about singing must do riyaaz. To this day I try to do my riyaaz as frequently as possible.
Q: Despite your partiality towards popular singing, you are extraordinarily adept at singing classical songs in films such as "Man mohana bade jhoothe" ("Seema") and "Mose chal kiye jaa" ("Guide").
Lata: The filmy classical song is not pure classical. Given a chance I'd have loved to sit with a tanpura on a stage to perform uninterrupted for two hours. But where was the time? I was recording songs round the clock.
Q: Any unfulfilled dreams?
Lata: I loved photography and painting. I wish I had time to pursue these interests.
Q: What is your message to the world?
Lata: Do your dharm and respect your karm. Success will follow. Nothing comes without hard work.

The New Indian Express
LUCKNOW: In a major decision to mitigate the issues plaguing the rural parts of Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath made it mandatory for every MBBS graduates of government medical colleges to work in villages for two years.
Issuing the directive here on Monday, the CM said that the doctors would be made to sign bonds for the same. “The doctors, who have done MD and MS, too will have to work for one year in rural areas and that no one will be allowed to influence the government for an internship,” said Adityanath.
The state is facing the paucity of over 6,000 doctors and owing to the dearth of doctors in rural areas, villagers are forced to come to the cities to avail medical facilities.
Claiming PM Jan Arogya Yojana to be a big success in the state, the CM said around 1.18 crore families got benefited through the scheme while 8.45 lakh families got the benefit from through CM Jan Arogya Yojana. Moreover, golden cards were distributed among 1.89 lakh people, he said.
Speaking at an event to mark the completion of one year of Ayushman Bharat Yojana, CM Yogi said: "We had to face several challenges when we launched this scheme around a year back. The biggest challenge was to make the benefits of this scheme reach the beneficiaries in a time-bound manner. We chalked out such a strategy that could help in making this scheme reach all the needy."
The CM said a total of 46.86 lakh golden cards have been made under the PM Jan Arogya Yojana in Uttar Pradesh and 1.89 lakh golden cards were distributed under the CM Arogya Yojana. The CM also gave an account of the work done during his 30 months’ tenure so far.
Earlier, Health and Medical minister Jai Pratap Singh said that people belonging to poor families used to take loans for the treatment of serious diseases, but Ayushman Yojna has come handy in solving their health woes in an effective manner.

The New Indian Express
HOWRAH: BJP state president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday said that fear is being created among people regarding the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
"They are creating fear among people regarding NRC. We are bringing the citizenship bill, we will need to discuss it with people. Mamata Banerjee could not stop the abrogation of Article 370, demonetisation and the passage of triple talaq bill. In the same way, we are bringing NRC and she won't be able to stop us this time as well," he said after a two-day programme of the RSS here.
"Earlier, they were getting money from the chit fund, now that it has stopped, they are devoid of any funds. There is a lot of threat in Paschim Banga. Thus, we are working on it," he said.
NRC, which aimed at segregating Indian citizens living in Assam from those who had illegally entered the state from Bangladesh excluded 19,06,657 persons, including those who did not submit their claims.
Several BJP leaders have been demanding to implement NRC in their respective states.
Earlier, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said that NRC will not be implemented in West Bengal and no one will be pushed out.
During the meeting, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat praised the work of the organisation in the state but said that there is a need to do better.

Reuters
HELMAND, Afghanistan/KABUL (Reuters) - At least 40 civilians attending a wedding party were killed by explosions and gunfire during a raid by U.S.-backed Afghan government forces on a nearby Islamist militant hideout, officials in Helmand province said on Monday. 
The raid, days after a U.S. drone strike aimed at militants hiding among farmers killed 32 pine nut harvesters, showed how civilians have borne the brunt of a war that has re-intensified since U.S.-Taliban peace talks collapsed two weeks ago. 
    Afghan officials said a house being used by the Taliban to train suicide bombers was located adjacent to the bride’s home that came under fire during Sunday night’s commando assault in the Musa Qala area of Helmand in Afghanistan’s south. 
    On Monday, 30-year-old Musa Qala resident Mohammad Salim carried bodies of cousins and relatives to a burial ground from a house decorated for his sister-in-law’s wedding. 
    Salim and two senior provincial government officials said 40 people, including 12 children, were killed at the wedding venue when Afghan forces swooped on the house used by Taliban and al Qaeda militants to train male and female suicide bombers.  
    “We were going to the bride’s house for the henna ceremony, some of us were outside the home and some inside, (when) suddenly the battle began...We told the security forces that we were not members of the Taliban,” Salim told Reuters. 
    “But both sides ended up killing civilians,” he said. Another 13 wedding party participants were injured.  
A senior Afghan Defence Ministry official said the raid was against “a foreign terrorist group actively engaged in organizing terrorist attacks”. He said government forces had also destroyed a large warehouse of militants’ equipment. 
A second ministry official said a foreign militant detonated a suicide vest that killed him and others around him, including a woman, in response to the raid. “We are aware that civilians were injured in the attack,” he said. 
    Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said they joined with Afghan security forces in the Helmand operation, conducting “precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and U.S. forces.” 
    Leggett said most of those killed in the operation were struck by the gunfire of militants or from detonations of their explosives caches or suicide vests. 
    The Helmand governor’s office said four senior Taliban commanders and the Taliban shadow governor of Musa Qala were among those killed. Twenty-two Taliban fighters in all were killed and 14 captured, the defense ministry said. Five Pakistanis and a Bangladeshi national were among those captured. 
Bombing, air strikes and ground clashes between U.S.-backed government forces and militants have flared anew since the  U.S.-Taliban negotiations fell apart, and ahead of a presidential election next week. 
    In the drone strike on Sept. 18 in the eastern province of Nangarhar, six local government officials said 32 pine nut harvesters were killed, 40 of whom were injured. 
    Malik Khyali, 62, a resident of Khogyani district in Nangarhar, said he lost a son in the drone strike and would not forgive those who carried it out as he knew of no militants hiding among laborers in the thickly wooded area.  
    Khyali said his son Madad Khan was employed as a cook who was serving meals to pine nut harvesters when a drone crashed into their tents. “I saw body parts being collected in several sacks...If you had seen them covered with blood and dirt, you would not be able to eat for days,” he told Reuters. 
The Taliban have been staging near-daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks in the run-up to the presidential election on Sept. 28 in order to discourage people from voting. 
    Last week a suicide bombing outside a hospital in Qalat in southern Afghanistan killed 39 people and injured 140. The Taliban said the target was a nearby building housing the regional government’s intelligence department.  
    Farah Sami, a mother of four whose three-year-old son was critically wounded in that attack, said combatants were engaged in mindless violence to justify their existence. 
“All sides have been killing civilians. There is no hero or villain in this long war,” she said. 
The United States in 2001 sent forces to Afghanistan to oust Taliban leaders after they refused to hand over members of the al Qaeda militant group behind the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
Since then, U.S. forces have backed Afghan troops in war against the al Qaeda, Taliban and Islamic State groups that recruit Afghans and foreigners who mount attacks against the Western-backed Afghan government and foreign forces.     
A U.N. report released on June 30 said 717 civilian deaths were attributed to American and Afghan forces during the first six months of the year, compared with 531 blamed on militants. 
    Last week President Ashraf Ghani promised measures to reduce civilian casualties. On Monday he tweeted a call for “extra caution” in military operations, and ordered investigations.  
(This story corrects to attribute deaths to six government officials in paragraph 14).

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s steel industry wants a 25% safeguard duty placed on all steel imports as steel products sourced from countries with whom India has a free trade agreement (FTA) have risen substantially, a senior executive from JSW Steel said on Monday.  
“India’s imports from FTA partners rose 77% (in the current fiscal),” said Seshagiri Rao, JSW’s joint managing director and group chief financial officer. 
Rao reiterated a longstanding industry demand to not include steel as part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a China-initiated free trade zone among countries that will encompass 45% of the world’s population.

The Financial Express
Bank Strike: In a big relief for millions of bank customers, bank unions have called off their two days proposed strike that was beginning from Thursday. The decision was announced following a meeting of bank unions with finance secretary Rajeev Kumar in New Delhi today. Our delegation met finance secretary Rajeev Kumar, with whom the issues related to mergers, wage revision, introduction of a five day week and reduction in cash transaction hours were discussed in detail and his response was positive to find workable solutions, said four bank unions in a joint statement, adding that following an appeal by the finance secretary they have decided to defer their proposed strike that was set to begin from Wednesday midnight.
“In view of the consideration of a positive and workable solution by the finance secretary, the 48th-hour strike from midnight of September 25 to 28 stands deferred,” AIBOC, AIBOA, INBOC and NOBO said in a joint statement.
Four large bank unions – All India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA), Indian National Bank Officers’ Congress (INBOC), and National Organisation of Bank Officers have called for a 48 hour long bank strike beginning from Thursday to protest the Union government’s decision to merge 6 public sector banks with 4 larger PSU banks.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has last month announced the third round of merger and consolidation among public sector banks.
In this round, a total of six banks will be merged with four larger public sector banks. In addition to the merger of OBC and UBI with PNB, four other banks will merge into three larger public sector banks.
The Syndicate Bank will merge with Canara Bank. While Corporation Bank and Andhra Bank will merge with Union Bank of India and Allahabad Bank will merge with the Indian Bank. This round of merger will bring down the total number of public sector banks to 12 and reduce the inter-bank competition among public sector banks.

In 2017, the government announced the merger of five associate banks of State Bank of India and Mahila Bank with the SBI. In the second round, the government cleared the merger of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank with Bank of Baroda.
However, the third round was vehemently opposed by the bank unions. However, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has expressed confidence to persuade the unions to postpone the strike following a meeting with the heads of public sector banks in New Delhi last Thursday.

“Finance secretary was positive in formation of a committee of all stakeholders to address the issue arising due to the proposed merger of 10 banks including preserving the identity of all the banks. An appeal was made to us to revisit our strike call in view of the discussions,” said the bank unions in the joint statement.

https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/sme/ritesh-agarwal-interview-it-is-still-day-0-for-us-but-an-entrepreneur-is-wired-for-risks-says-oyo-founder/1715102/?utm_term=&utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_source=inshorts
The Financial Express
At a young age, OYO Hotels & Homes Founder and CEO (Group) Ritesh Agarwal has got his hands full in building a model that perhaps doesn’t have any precedent globally. But being the only one-of-its-kind globally, OYO might have everything to lose given the scale at which it is. But does that bother Agarwal? “That’s an interesting question. Being the only one-of-its-kind globally is a good thing for us in many ways. Our competition is with what we were yesterday,” said Agarwal who is a huge believer in Kaizen — the philosophy of continuous learning and improvement.
At 25, probably the youngest entrepreneur heading a company that has a private market valuation of $5 billion “it is still Day 0,” according to Agarwal as he speaks to Sandeep Soni in a freewheeling and wide-ranging interaction more as the entrepreneur Ritesh Agarwal and less as the leader of the company that is soon to catapult into the biggest hotel chain globally. Below are the edited excerpts – part 1.
Businesses say we can turn profitable whenever we want but scale comes first. I am sure this is the case with OYO as well. How does OYO’s profitability path look like?
Profitability is something that is very much on our radar. We are profitable at a building-level. We have been investing in technology, talent and hotel infrastructure upgradation. On a Y-o-Y basis, we have seen that not just our buildings are operating profitably at the building level but our EBITDA has also improved by 50 per cent (on a Y-o-Y basis).
We are thinking long term and are operating with a clear path of operating efficiency. The losses as a percentage of Net Realised Value have been on a steady and significant declining curve. This year, the company has seen a 4.4x Y-o-Y growth in revenue in June 2019 (versus June 2018), with 1 million rooms under management across hotels and homes; with over 200,000 rooms in India.
Do you think, because of the growth so far and vision ahead, your business model is invincible now, much like what companies like Nokia or Kodak or Yahoo perhaps also thought?
From my perspective, as an entrepreneur, one is wired to take risks. You, of course, need to be smart and take calculated risks, and then do all you can to make it worth the risk. At OYO, we certainly don’t rest on our laurels. For us, it is still Day 0 and we have a long way to go. There is always room for improvement in experience and it can be achieved if one listens to the customers carefully.
We place our bets on technology and innovation. While we are the first hotel chain to develop in-house technology platform and operating systems, including a suite of over 20 apps for managing all aspects of operations, we are always on the look-out for identifying and adapting to the next big thing. Case in point – IoT switches or evaluating greater use of AI as well as VR or AR for audits and hotel transformation.
As an individual, what thought process you go through during testing times such as hotel partners agitation, associations questioning the company’s intent, police case etc.?
That’s a very interesting question. When you scale up your business there will invariably be small groups of vested interests unwilling to see the new ground reality. If you see the history of entrepreneurship in India and elsewhere globally, there are many examples of entrepreneurs navigating their way through these challenges. We will not bow down to the unreasonable demands of vested interest groups, a majority of which are owners running competing properties, instigating and intimidating independent hotel owners associated with OYO, and creating false public uproar or arguing against transparent pricing and quality standards introduced by OYO that can fundamentally improve customer experience.
So how do you look at addressing these problems?
At OYO, we often refer to this as an occupational hazard, that one has to work with keeping in mind the larger picture – 18,000+ hotel owners in India alone choosing OYO and growing with OYO. This year alone, we have had over 642 hotel owners, with hotel sales over Rs 1 crore each, a stark increase from their earnings before becoming a part of OYO. So my personal thought process is to treat the issues based on their merit. The OYO Partner Engagement Network (OPEN) is a great example of us spending our energies on identifying ways and initiatives that can add value to an OYO hotel owner’s experience. I don’t let needless speculation deter me or my team from pursuing our mission.
Culturally, the business has to be flexible according to every new market it enters. How do you ensure that at OYO?
Our teams across the international geographies have observed local nuances with respect to the hotel industry in each of the countries we are present in. These observations help us in highly localizing and personalizing the experience for our guests. For instance, in the Philippines, most hotel rooms also keep a copy of the Bible in the drawer/on the table in the rooms for guests. In Indonesia, most hotel rooms have the Qibla sign also known as Arah Kiblat in the local language Bahasa. As Malaysia hosts a lot of Indian tourists, the hotels provide information on the nearest Indian/South Indian restaurants.
Do you think you have got everything right at OYO so far? Did you ever compromise on growth for anything?
Nobody or no company in this world can say they have got everything right and it has been a perfect journey. In 2015, there was a time when we had a lot of complaints regarding our customer service. We took the hard decision of stopping growth for four months, no matter what our shareholders said. And I feel it was one of the best things we did. We focused on identifying key problem areas and finding solutions that are scalable.
Today, as we scale across 800 cities and 80 countries worldwide, we adopt a problem-solving approach, identify the opportunity in the middle of every potential difficulty and cultivate cross-functional synergies to surmount obstacles.

Journalist and Ramon Magsaysay Award winner Ravish Kumar was awarded the inaugural Gauri Lankesh National Award for Journalism at a ceremony in Bengaluru on Sunday. The award was announced on September 5 on the second death anniversary of Gauri Lankesh by the Gauri Memorial Trust.
Speaking while receiving the award, Ravish Kumar, the Managing Editor of NDTV India, said that the award was not a cause for celebration. "I cannot comprehend how the people living in Bengaluru who consider themselves broad-minded can live with the fact that a reporter was shot dead on the streets. The death of a journalist is the death of the democratic system on which you trust and step outside your house thinking there is a system to protect you."
He also chose to focus his speech on the debate surrounding the imposition of Hindi over other languages in the country. "There is no need to fear those who impose Hindi. It cannot be the language that unites the country. In the Hindi speaking states, there are no good universities or education. The number of Hindi speakers appearing for UPSC exams have reduced and in Uttar Pradesh, 10 lakh students failed Hindi...A taxi driver in Bengaluru knows up to five languages and there is something we can learn from that," Ravish said.
Ravish also saved a few words for the Indian media, which he said, is killing the spirit of democracy. "If you love democracy, you will have to fight the media. The media has long fought for democracy but today the situation has changed. Stop subscribing to newspapers, stop watching television channels and protest in the streets. It looks impossible today but tomorrow you will have to do it," said the television journalist.
He accused the mainstream media of not carrying voices of dissent, stating, “Many people who come to the streets to protest are those who have voted for the current government. The media is not carrying these voices. The people who are at the protest share the photos between themselves and post it on social media in the hope that it goes viral. The media is recording this but it is not publishing these stories. The mainstream media is busy telling the voter why we are better off under the current government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”
The award was announced by the Gauri Memorial Trust and presented to Ravish by 102-year-old freedom fighter HS Doreswamy. An English news website in honour of Gauri Lankesh - www.gaurilankeshnews.com  - was also launched which will be managed by the trust. This is in addition to 'Nyaya Patha', the newspaper relaunched in memory of Gauri Lankesh.
Gauri Lankesh was murdered on September 5 2017 at her residence in Bengaluru allegedly by people who wanted to eliminate anti-Hindu forces. The murder shook the conscience of people across the country with thousands taking to the streets across the country, a week after the murder.
Two years since her murder, 18 people have been named in the chargesheet by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the murder. This includes six people, who are also named as accused in the murder of scholar and rationalist MM Kalburgi, which took place four years ago in Dharwad. These men were linked to the Sanatan Sanstha, a radical pro-Hindu group.

		             NEW DELHI :
Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa's wife Novel Singhal Lavasa has come under the scanner of the Income Tax Department on charges of alleged tax evasion, official sources said on Monday.
Lavasa's wife has been issued a notice by the department to explain certain details in her I-T Returns (ITR) with regard to holding directorship in about 10 companies, they said.
The officials said after preliminary investigation, the tax department has asked her to provide more documents related to her personal finances.
The department is looking at the ITRs of Novel Singhal Lavasa to ascertain if her income has escaped assessment in the past or something has been concealed from tax authorities, they said.
The probe into alleged tax evasion and holding of directorship in multiple firms against the former banker pertains to a time period between 2015-17, they sa“There have been reports in certain sections of the media about Income Tax notices to the undersigned regarding ‘discrepancies in tax returns’ filed by me. It is stated that I have paid all taxes due towards me and disclosed all income earned by me from pension, and all other sources as per Income Tax law," Novel said in a statement to Mint's query.id.
She also said, “It is clarified that having served as a Class I officer with the State Bank of India for 28 years and having acquired vast experience in Banking and Development, I continue to be engaged in various professional activities, including as independent Director in a few companies."
“I have replied to all IT notices received since 5th August 2019 and have been cooperating with the ongoing process of the department," Novel added.

Ashok Lavasa was appointed election commissioner on January 23, 2018, after he retired as the Union Finance Secretary in the previous year.
His difference of opinion, with regard to the implementation of the model code of conduct (MCC), with Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra was reported during the recently-concluded general elections.
Mint contributed to this story.

ANI
By Ankur SharmaNew Delhi (India), Sept 23 (ANI): Now all the drones seized from across the country by government authorities will be handed over to Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Defence Ministry.The drones have been seized from the common people who tried to bring them in the country through airports and other locations."The ministries will get all the drones as per their requirements free of cost. The Government of India has cleared its way to handing over all drones to these two ministries who deal with national security," top government sources told ANI.Handing over of drones will be done after due process and will be distributed equally between the MoD and the MHA (and their constituent organisations/agencies) after a joint inspection that will be conducted by the nodal officers of the MoD and the MHA.The step has been taken after the drone attack on the world's biggest oil company -- Aramco -- in Saudi Arabia this month. The distribution of drones will be done twice every year.The Ministry of Home Affairs has raised the issue of disposal of drones considering auction or dismantling of drones as a threat to the nation."The MHA has categorically directed that the drones should not be auctioned/sold as such or even in dismantled condition in the open market; and that due to security reasons, these should be handed over to the defence or security forces only," a circular issued by the Ministry of Finance after consultation with the MHA said.In India, it is illegal for the public to operate drones without getting written clearance from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The government is in the process of formulating the usage of drones in India.All drones weighing more than 250 grams and up to 150 kilograms will be handed over to the two ministries."All the drones of all the categories shall be transferred to the warehouses of the following Customs formations, namely, Chennai (Airport), Delhi (IGIA), Kolkata (Airport) and Mumbai (Airport), which shall be the focal Commissionerates for stocking, segregation, joint inspection by all agencies and distribution," the circular said."As regards the future stock of the drones that are received by the focal Customs Commissionerates from time to time, the requirements of DRI and Customs field formations shall be met first. Thereafter, the MoD and the MHA (and their constituent organization, agencies) shall be invited for a joint inspection to be conducted by the nodal officers of the MoD and the MHA (or their representatives) bi-annually in the second/ third week of January and July. In case either Ministry does not turn up for such joint inspection or forgoes its quota, the same would be made available to the other."The government has also clarified that the drones shall be supplied on a gratis basis (free-of-cost) on 'as-is-where-is' condition and it will be the responsibility of the recipient to comply with all the regulatory requirements. "No drone would be resold after the end of their life or when they become obsolete or irreparable. Such drones shall be destroyed by all the recipient," says the circular. (ANI)

New Delhi [India], Sept 23 (ANI): A woman journalist suffered injuries on her face and hand after she was attacked by two bike-borne robbers in broad daylight who dragged her out an auto-rickshaw, snatched her phone and managed to flee.The incident occurred on Sunday near Chittaranjan Park in New Delhi when the journalist, Joymala Bagchi, who works with ANI, was travelling in an auto-ricksha.Bagchi suffered a fracture in her jaw and got stitches on her chin. She also suffered injuries on her hand. Bagchi was profusely bleeding when the locals came to her rescue. She was later taken to a nearby hospital by Delhi Police and later shifted to AIIMS."We have received a complaint and have registered a case against the accused persons under Section 394 - for voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery," said Atul Thakur, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South)."I had gone for shopping near CR Park and was returning back at around 6 pm in an auto when two bike-borne miscreants came close to my auto while the traffic movement was slow. They dragged me out of the moving auto. Later, they snatched my phone and sped away," Bagchi said.Bagchi, who has been raising her voice against such crimes, said there was no CCTV footage of the incident."As a journalist, I am appalled. Where are the CCTV cameras? I was attacked in broad daylight. What if a speeding car had hit me? Is this how unsafe the capital is? Today morning I got to know, that there is no CCTV footage of the incident and so far no lead. Two snatchers are so well acquainted with the city that they know which part of the city has no CCTV camera," she said."Will we get justice? If the ones who have the power to highlight such incidents do not feel safe, imagine the plight of ordinary citizens," she added. (ANI)

Sixteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, in an emotional address at the United Nations Climate Summit in New York on Monday, 23 September, said that the world leaders have ‘failed the future generations by failing to act against climate crisis.’
"This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you," she said, pointing at government and corporate inaction over the climate crisis.

She added that the leaders have stolen her “dreams and childhood.”
Pointing out that the world is at the beginning of a mass extinction, the Swedish teenager also took a dig at the politicians for worrying only about economic growth.

She said that a 50 percent rise in emissions is “simply not acceptable” as it is the future generations that have to live with the consequences.
Thunberg, in September 2018 sat in front of her country's Parliament to shed light on environmental problems and government inaction on it.
While she initially protested for a few days at a stretch, it soon evolved into a weekly protest, where Thunberg would miss school and protest in front of her Parliament. The strike soon turned into a global movement with Friday demonstrations becoming a regular affair.
Just a yeat later, on 20 September, over 4 million people across 163 countries participated in the strike against climate change. Their demand was simple: to pressure governments and companies to stop burning fossil fuels and take real action to overcome the climate crisis.
The strike was called forth across in 5,800 different locations, and inspired millions to take action in saving their environment – all led by this 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist.

The Department of Telecom is making additions to the Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), a centralised database of the IMEI numbers of all mobile devices in the country, which was launched earlier this year. 
The ministry has asked handset manufacturers to submit the database of the 15 digits long unique identification code termed as International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) within the next two months. 
 DoT has been in talks with Indian and international mobile handset manufacturers to compile the IMEI codes for all the mobile phones sold in the country for security purposes. IMEI code is used by the authorities to track mobile phones across the various network providers and to block it if needed. 
The unique number attached to every mobile device is given by global industry body GSMA, and all telecom operators have their respective database of IMEI numbers of the handsets on their networks. Under the current system, if a mobile phone is reported stolen, it can only be blocked by their previous network provider who had the IMEI details of the stolen handset.
Recently, the government has launched a central tracking portal Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), which is undergoing a pilot test in Mumbai, helping users to detect their lost or stolen mobile phones by tracking IMEI number across networks. 
Talking to ET, a senior official informed that the government currently has the data of all the phone imported in India as it is part of the customs process. Since a large number of phones are being manufactured in India, the department has asked all Indian manufacturers to share the data of IMEI numbers embedded in the hardware of the handsets at the time of manufacturing. 
There have been reports of hackers reprogramming the IMEI numbers in the stolen handsets to prevent tracking by the authorities, and the department is looking to curb that with the centralised list.
 Although it is still unknown how this move would hamper the privacy of citizen as the move can allow the government to track all the citizens carrying a mobile phone. Further, there are possibilities of a data breach and the related privacy concerns as well.

		             NEW DELHI :
Allaying fears of the automobile industry, Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday said there is no need to ban petrol and diesel vehicles as electric mobility has picked up momentum on its own and all buses would be electric in two years.
Earlier, government think-tank Niti Aayog had reportedly proposed that after 2030, only electric vehicles (EVs) should be sold in India. Later, Union ministers, including Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, tried to allay the fear of automobile manufactures in the country by denying that.
A panel headed by Niti Aayog Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Kant had earlier suggested that only EVs (three-wheelers and two-wheelers) with an engine capacity of up to 150cc should be sold from 2025 onwards.
"I always talk about EVs such as cars, bikes, and buses. Now, it has started naturally. There is no need to make it mandatory. There is not need to ban petrol and diesel vehicles. In the next two years, all buses would be electric and run on bio-ethanol and CNG (compressed natural gas)," Gadkari said while speaking at a National Conclave on Energy Efficiency in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) here.

Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he discussed Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son in a call with Ukraine’s president. 
Trump’s statement to reporters about his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came as the Democratic leader of a key congressional panel said the pursuit of Trump’s impeachment may be the “only remedy” to the situation. 
Trump’s call with Zelensky has been at the center of an escalating battle in Washington since Friday, when news outlets reported that Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian leader to investigate whether Biden, the Democratic front-runner to take on Trump in next year’s election, misused his position when he was vice president. 
Trump told reporters at the White House that their phone conversation was mostly congratulatory but also touched on corruption and the Bidens. 
“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said. 
Democrats have said that if Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden, it is tantamount to promoting foreign interference in the 2020 election.  
Trump has denied doing anything improper. His allies, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have defended the president’s phone call, which, according to news reports, was the subject of a complaint made by an as-yet-unnamed whistleblower.  
If an investigation shows that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden, the U.S. Congress may have no choice but to pursue impeachment, Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on Sunday. 
Schiff had previously shied away from calling for impeachment, but his comments on CNN’s “State of the Union” showed his stance had shifted. 
“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader to do something illicit, to provide dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that conduct represents,” Schiff said. 
Other legislators have called for the Democratic leadership to pursue impeachment immediately, but Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far resisted calls to formally begin the process. 
In a letter to colleagues later on Sunday, Pelosi warned the administration against keeping the details of the whistleblower complaint secret. The administration has so far resisted sharing the details of the complaint with lawmakers. 
“If the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” Pelosi wrote. 
Senator Mitt Romney, who has clashed with Trump in the past, sounded a rare note of concern among Trump’s fellow Republicans, many of whom have remained silent, defended Trump or escalated their attacks on Biden in the days after the reports about the Trump-Zelensky call. 
“If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,” Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said in a Twitter post. 
Impeachment proceedings in Congress, which begin in the House, can lead to a president being removed from office, but Democrats would need the support of Republicans, who control the Senate.  
Multiple news organizations reported on Friday that Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden’s son was involved was fired. 
Biden has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired but denies it was to help his son. Biden said the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases. 
Biden said on Saturday there should be an investigation into Trump’s call, saying it “appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.” He said he never spoke to his son about Ukraine.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero is “free to leave,” Iran’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Hamid Baeidinejad, said on Twitter on Monday. 
“The British-flagged tanker ‘Stena Impero’, pursuant to the completion of the judicial and legal process, is now free to leave,” he wrote. 
The seizure on July 19 of the ship, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, ratcheted up tensions in the region in the wake of attacks on other merchant vessels that Washington blamed on Tehran. 
Iran denied responsibility for those attacks, which took place along a vital international oil shipping route. 
An Iranian government spokesman said on Monday that all legal steps had been completed for the release of the detained tanker but that he did not know when the vessel would be released, Iranian media reported. 
“The legal work and administrative procedures for the release of the English tanker have been completed but I have no information on the time of the release,” said government spokesman Ali Rabiei, according to semi-official news agency ILNA. 
The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Rabiei as saying: “The legal work for the oil tanker is over ... and the oil tanker can move, and the decisions indicate the end of the detention.” He did not elaborate. 
Relations between the United States, its allies and Iran have been gradually more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact aimed at reining in Tehran’s nuclear program and imposed sanctions on it aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.

Surveen Chawla has possibly been one of the most popular faces on Indian television. So much so that the actress has been nominated several times and even won many awards. Then, she decided to transition into films and all the roadblocks started coming her way. Despite being famous already, she had to battle severe criticism - from being called an 'over exposed' TV actress to an 'overweight girl at 56 kilos'. But that wasn't just it. Much to our horror, she reveals that she had to face the casting couch not once or twice but five times in her filmy career - thrice down South and twice here in Bollywood. Here, she gets talking about her untold story which is nothing less than shocking.
 

What about Bollywood? She says she's faced enough here as well. "A director wanted to see how my cleavage looked. Another director wanted to see how my thighs looked," Surveen concluded. She also revealed that there was a time when she was called overweight. "I went to give this audition and the person told me, 'You are overweight'. I was just 56 kilos and I thought the person needed glasses," she laughs out loud.
Another incident, she remembers, where she was called out for doing TV. "Yes, there was a time when people told me you are over exposed because of television. For sometime, I tried to hide it from producers and tell them I did TV only for a year but I realised later that 'Why am I doing this?' Isn't it going to be easier for a team to get someone who already knows how to do their lines?," she concluded.

Whether his team wins or loses, India captain Virat Kohli is never short of his aggressive best. The ace batsman had a moment of ‘clash’ with South Africa bowler Beuran Hendricks during the third T20I in Bengaluru on Sunday. Kohli though failed with the bat in this match after winning the toss and electing to bat. India had an ordinary batting performance that saw the Proteas winning by 9 wickets to level the three-match series 1-1. India won the second game in Mohali by seven wickets while the first match in Dharamsala was abandoned because of rain.
It all happened when Kohli was batting and Hendricks was the bowler. The South African did not move from the batsman’s running corridor and that saw the Indian captain, who was taking a run, nudge the bowler with his elbow, leaving him stunned.

Hendricks, however, had a field day with two vital wickets – Rohit Sharma (9) and Krunal Pandya (4) that reduced the hosts into a troubled lot. The left-arm pacer, who was playing in just his 11th T20I, ended up with 2/14 in four overs which was SA’s best bowling performance and was picked as the man of the match. The visitors restricted the powerful Indian batting line-up to 134 for 9 and then won the game with nine wickets and 19 balls to spare.
For India, Shikhar Dhawan was the highest scorer with 36 from 25 balls. For the South Africans, captain Quinton de Kock slammed an unbeaten 79 and opener Reeza Hendricks made 28. The two added 76 runs for the first wicket to take the match out of India’s reach. De Kock and Temba Bavuma added 64 runs for the second wicket to seal the game.

Rishabh Pant came out at No.4 in this match but could score only 19. Shreyas Iyer, another talented youngster, fell for only five to leave India’s middle order exposed. “Look, we will have to take risks. Even when you want to win a game of cricket you have to take risks, so nothing is a given, nothing is a guaranteed before you start playing,” Kohli said at the post-match press conference on Sunday when asked about his decision to bat first.
“I think as a team if we are willing to get out of our comfort zone a lot more, then we will be unfazed with what happens at the toss. That’s our basis idea: trying to take the toss out of the equation as a side.”

Daily Mail
China is seeking to get to the bottom of a mysterious 'gel-like substance' found in a crater on the far side of the moon. 
The nation's Chang'e-4 lunar lander's rover, Yutu-2,spotted the bizarre matter last month but it had to shut down and 'nap' almost straight after. 
The equipment shuts down for 14 days as the lunar night is so cold it would freeze and destroy the rover if it did not shut down and protect itself. 
After waking up last week, China sent the rover back to the site in a bid to picture, obtain and study the material. 
Scroll down for video 
The nation's Chang'e-4 lunar lander's rover, Yutu-2,spotted the bizarre matter last month but it had to shut down and 'nap' almost straight after. It has now returned to the crater, with the green-ish tinge in this iage revealing the location of the substance 
A recent post on Chinese social media revealed some details about how the Chinese space agency (CNSA) was intending to detect the material. 
Debate raged between the mission's driver teams and scientists and eventually, Yutu-2 was sent into the small crater to try and find more information. 
A first pass was unsuccessful, but a second attempt allowed the machine to get close enough to study the substance with the on board spectrometer. 
It was studied successfully, CNSA revealed, but the exact findings are still a mystery.   
A team member looking at the rover's main camera in August spotted the small crater, which appeared to contain material with a colour unlike the surrounding lunar surface, Space.com reported. 
Having seen the images, lunar scientists decided to postpone plans to send Yutu-2, which translates to jade rabbit, further west.
Instead, the machine was ordered to check the strange material. 
The rover, which is on the moon with the Chang'e-4 lunar probe, carefully approached the crater and then targeted the strangely-coloured material. 
It was then that the scientists made the strange discovery, although they have so far only said that the substance was 'gel-like' and an 'unusual colour'.
One possible theory which was suggested by researchers not involved with the mission is that the substance is melted glass created from meteorites striking the surface of the moon.
Pictured, tracks made from Yutu-2, which translates to Jade Rabbit, near the crater where the substance was found on the far side of the moon 
 The Yutu-2 rover, which landed on the far side of the moon in January of this year, found the substance last month but news of the discovery has just been made public
Yutu-2 has a host of instruments and will be powered by solar panels. This includes a spectrometer which was used to analyse the bizarre find  
Jade Rabbit 2 weighs 308lbs (139kg) and has six individually powered wheels so it can continue to operate even if one wheel fails. It rolled on to the lunar surface from the lander via two ramps and will explore the Von Karman crater in the southern region of the far side of the moon 
Chang'e is the moon goddess and wife of god Houyi in Ancient Chinese mythology. 
Houyi is one of the most powerful mythological figures in China. 
It is said that he shot down nine Suns to make Earth a liveable habitat for human beings.
The number four in the name is a more modern-day nod to the space programme. 
This spacecraft is the fourth of the Chang'e missions.  
Yutu (jade rabbit) is the companion of Chang'e in the mythological stories. 
This is fittingly also the name of the rover on-board Chang'e-4. 
Yutu-2 is so labelled because it is the successor to Yutu-1 which was deployed from the Chang'e-3 mission earlier this decade.  
Queqiao is the relay satellite and translates to Magpie Bridge.
This name also stems from Ancient Chinese mythology.
Queqiao, or the Magpie Bridge, is a legendary bridge which appears once a year to connect Niu Lang and Zhi Nv.
Niu Lang is a cattle herder on Earth while Zhi Nv, or the Weaving Maid, is a goddess in heaven.
The couple met and fell in love when Zhi Nv snuck to the 'human world' in secret to play. Their union enraged the chief goddess, Queen Mother of the West.
The couple got banished to live at different sides of the Milky Way.
Every year on the seventh day of the seventh month on the Lunar Calendar, thousands of magpies that are moved by the couples' love story will form the Magpie Bridge, or Queqiao, so that Niu Lang and Zhi Nv can meet each other. 
This relay satellite will allow communication between the moon probe and Earth.  
China's space agency previously said the current mission 'lifted the mysterious veil' from the far side of the moon, which is never seen from Earth, and 'opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration'.
Because the space craft is solar powered, it has to switch off during a lunar night on the moon, during which there will be no sunlight.
The temperature on a lunar night is about -180°C (-292°F) and can get high during the day, where 'insulating' components like the gold coloured layers outside the lander and rover keep them cool.
Results of experiments from the mission could lead to new understandings of the challenges faced by settlers who may one day colonise our natural satellite. 
Israel attempted to land on the moon earlier this year but the mission ended in disaster when the Beresheet spacecraft fell into an uncontrolled descent. So far, only three nations have completed a successful mission to the lunar surface, the US, the USSR and China

Times Now
Mumbai: In an act of courage, a woman staffer of the Mumbai airport chased and caught her molester, who called her an 'item' in Vile Parle area of Mumbai on Friday. The 26-year-old accused was later arrested by police. He has been sent to judicial custody.
The incident took place on Friday evening when the victim was on her way to the bus station after finishing her duty. The accused identified as Dinesh Yadav was caught by the woman.
According to a report, the accused was in an inebriated state when he molested the woman. An airport police officer said that the accused called the victim an 'item' and tried to flee from the spot, but was caught by the woman.  
The victim was dropped at the bus station in Dr Rajendra Prasad Nagar locality by her colleague so that she could catch a bus for home. 
Police have booked the accused under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 509 (intent to outrage the modesty of woman) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 
The police have not revealed the identity of the woman keeping in view the Supreme Court guidelines to protect the privacy of the victim.
In another incident in January this year,  a stray dog rescued a 29-year-old woman from being molested inside her own home by a neighbour. The accused barged into the house and attempted to sexually assault the woman.
The incident took place when the woman, a resident of a residential colony in Bhopal's Chhola area, was alone at home. A stray dog who is often cared for by the colony's residents called 'Sheru', was inside the woman's home. A doorbell at around 3 pm woke the canine from his slumber and he saw a man trying to molest the woman. 
Sheru attacked the man and managed to chase him away but incurred severe injuries during the attack. In her complaint to the Chhola police, the woman claims that the accused is her neighbour. He is jobless and is known to create a nuisance, said the woman in her complaint. The victim also told police how the accused Sunil stabbed Sheru as the animal was trying to protect her.

The News Minute
13-year-old Satvik Hegde was standing at the end of a line of children dressed in Indian garb as two of the biggest leaders in the world — US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — walk past them. As they reach the end of the line, young Satvik, dressed in all white, boldly steps forward. A mobile phone in his hand, he asks the two leaders for a selfie.
As Trump and Modi turn back to him, the girl who was standing next to Satvik, expresses the kind of shock that eventually rippled through the internet, her eyes wide and her hands covering her mouth in surprise.
Trump puts his hand on Modi’s back and they huddle together for a selfie. A video of the encounter has received thousands of shares on Twitter, and the photo of Trump, Modi and the braces-wearing boy, smiling widely, has gone viral.
The boy, discovered to be Satvik Hegde whose family hails from Karnataka, was a part of the yoga showcase at the massive Howdy Modi event, which saw over 50,000 people in attendance. The event saw Bharatnatyam, Garba, Mohiniattam and other dances.
Satvik’s family is from Uttara Kannada, Sirsi and moved to San Antonio, Texas 17 years ago. His father, Prabhakar, works for a private company and his mother, Medha, is a public school teacher, his uncle Ganesh Hegde told TNM.
"We knew that he was part of a yoga programme but in TV, we could not identify that it was him. He was doing surya namaskaara in the programme held during the day yesterday. We received the selfie on WhatsApp but when we saw it we were surprised," Ganesh said.
The uncle was all praise for his nephew. "The boy is disciplined and does all his work on time. Not just because he is my relative but because I cannot argue with him in our family! He has the knowledge that none of the others in the family have."

Howdy Modi, which was held in Houston, Texas, also saw US President Donald Trump in attendance. Modi called US President Donald Trump a friend of India, and gave a wide-ranging speech that referenced Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir and Pakistan's animosity towards India.
The event was organised by the Texas India Forum (TIF), Inc.

Times Now
Surat: If you are a social media aficionado, you probably stumbled upon several notifications and updates about a bizarre competition that was being organised in Surat. The 'What The Fart (WTF)' farting contest, conceptualised by Yatin Sangoi, aimed to judge how loud and melodic fart sounds are.  While the much-hyped event did take place at a banquet hall on Sunday, only 3 out of 200 participants showed up.
Yes, the competition that was searching for the biggest ‘Padshah’ ran out of gas and turned out to be a disappointing affair.
According to reports, over 200 people from Mumbai, Delhi,  Jaipur, and even Dubai had signed up to participate in the competition. However, the turnout was so low, that the gas masks and the cloud-shaped trophies remained untouched.
Sushil Jain, the first participant, had travelled all the way from Bholardi for an hour on an empty stomach. He took a few sips of the milk tea that was being served at the banquet hall before ascending the stage to perform. But every time he did so, the stipulated time would expire without any emission.
The local participant, Vishu Heda, walked out with a cash prize of Rs 2,500 despite having failed to fart even once.
When the contest ended, the organiser Yatin Sangoi joked the participants couldn’t perform due to  “performance pressure”. Sangoi’s had previously said that his intention was to ‘normalise the process’ of farting because he thought it had become too sophisticated with many considering it to as an act too gross. He added that many are even shamed publicly despite the fact that farting is one of the healthiest body functions.
Several visitors, who were potential participants, decided not to contest out of shyness, said Sangoi. 
Sangoi even invited Dr Rajesh Chandhani, a surgeon,  to attend to emergencies, if there were any. Unfortunately, his presence was not enough to attract participants.
“People think it's bad to fart. It is socially unacceptable. But it is not good to hold a fart long-term. It can lead to dementia and early forgetfulness," said Dr Chandhani.

Daily Mail
Mario Balotelli is set make his Brescia debut on Tuesday when they take on Italian champions Juventus at Stadio Mario Rigamonti. 
The forward signed for his hometown club last month but has been serving a four-game suspension after being sent off as a Marseille player on the final day of last season. 
The 29-year-old is now available to Brescia boss Euginio Corini ahead of the fifth round of Serie A fixtures, and Balotelli believes he is as fit as he's ever been.
Mario Balotelli is prepared to playe his first game for Brescia against Juventus
'I think I have worked more during this month and a half than during the last ten years of my career,' the Italy international told DAZN. 
I'm approaching a weight form that I rarely had. The last time was in Manchester City when I was 20 years old.' 
On the prospect of facing Cristiano Ronaldo in his first game in a Brescia shirt, Balotelli said: 'It does not interest me to play against Cristiano. 
'He is a great player, the best in the world with Messi, but it does not excite me, it will be a match like the others.'
Balotelli believes he's the fittest he's been since winning the Premier League in 2012

Reuters
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co said on Sunday it was not interested in acquiring struggling Oi SA (OIBR3.SA) or any other Brazilian carrier. 
Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported on Saturday in its online version that Huawei was joining forces with China Mobile (0941.HK) to potentially enter a dispute to buy Oi SA (OIBR3.SA). 
“Huawei has no plan or interest in acquiring Oi or any other Brazilian carrier. In Brazil for more than 20 years, the company is working with all major Brazilian carriers supplying the best products and solutions to support digital transformation in Brazil,” the company said in an emailed statement. 
According to O Globo, the two Chinese companies expect the Brazil business to grow significantly once the country starts deploying its fifth-generation wireless technology (5G), and Oi’s 360,000 km (224,000 miles) of fiber infrastructure is seen as an attractive asset. 
China Mobile did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, and Oi declined to comment. 
Brazil’s largest fixed-line carrier has been struggling to turn around its business since it filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2016 to restructure approximately 65 billion reais of debt. 
On Thursday, Reuters reported that, while negotiating its mobile network with Spain’s Telefonica SA (TEF.MC) and Telecom Italia SpA (TLIT.MI), Oi is also involved in preliminary talks with AT&T Inc (T.N) and another Chinese company.

ANI
By Pragya KaushikaNew Delhi [India], Sept 23 (ANI): BJP will not allocate assembly tickets to relatives of its incumbent MPs, Mayors or district council chairpersons in the upcoming elections in Haryana. The party has also decided not to field anyone above the age of 75 years in the crucial polls.The decision was taken at a meeting of BJP's Haryana election committee on Sunday. Sources in the party said that the decision was taken after several MPs and senior state party leaders demanded tickets for their kin for the elections.It may be noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has time and again targeted opposition parties in Haryana including Congress, INLD and Jannayak Janata Party for supporting dynastic politics."We have decided that relatives of MPs, mayors and district Council heads won't get tickets in the upcoming assembly elections. In fact, MLAs will also be discouraged from seeking tickets for their family members. Unless there is an absolute emergency, we won't be giving tickets to any relatives", said a senior party leader from the state. It is learnt that both Khattar and Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala were of a clear view that the party should not promote dynastic politics in the state. State party leaders reiterated that there is no place for dynastic politics in the BJP and only people committed to the party's ideology and the cause will be fielded in the polls.The BJP feels that giving tickets to the kin of its leaders would send a wrong message to its cadre ahead of the Assembly polls. "The party doesn't want to disrespect workers who put in a lot of efforts and show commitment towards the organisation. We want to respect their sentiments by not offering tickets to the kin of leaders, as they may be perceived as outsiders," the sources said.  The 90-member state Assembly goes to polls on October 21. The counting of votes will take place on October 24.In Haryana, BJP with the leadership of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar looks confident of a comeback, while the Congress seems to be engrossed in internal rivalries between various factions. In 2014 elections, BJP won 47 seats limiting Congress to only 15 in Haryana.After winning an unprecedented 10 seats in the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls in Haryana, the state party unit has now been tasked with securing a two-third majority in the 90 member legislature.

On September 14, CyCa OncoSolutions, founded by Dr Nusrat Sanghamitra, won the third prize at the She Loves Tech Global Startup Competition 2019 held in Beijing. Based in Odisha, the startup has developed a 'path-breaking cancer drug delivery device'. 

Dr Nusrat Sanghamitra receiving the award
Mentored by Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), CyCa OncoSolutions has been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer treatment. It started operations from KIIT-TBI Bhubaneswar, and recently moved to NCL Innovation Park, Pune. It also has an Irish branch, which operates from University College, Cork.

The startup has developed an 'efficient, non-toxic invitro and in vivo' delivery method to combat cancer. It works through a nano-technology driven molecular drilling device and directly delivers anti-cancer medicines to the affected cells. It is expected to cause very little harm to the unaffected cells and display fewer side effects. 


Initially a researcher and scientist in chemistry, Dr Nusrat was determined to find a better anti-cancer drug with fewer side effects. She eventually shifted her research to protein engineering, biophysics, and cell biology, and ventured into entrepreneurship. Speaking about her journey, she says,


The startup had previously won the first prize at the She Loves Tech India meet organised by KSUM in Kochi last month. Following this, Dr Nusrat attended a four-day boot camp in Beijing and subsequently made her way to the global summit.

Startups from Germany and the US bagged the first and second prizes respectively at the summit, which saw a total of 15 women-led enterprises from around the world for the final round.

B2B and Software as a Service (SaaS) startups seeking growth capital can now look forward to a venture capital fund specially focused on this segment. Avataar Venture Partners, founded by Mohan Kumar, former partner with Norwest Venture Partners India and Nishant Rao, ex-chief operating officer, Freshworks, has announced a $300 million fund for this segment.

Avataar Venture Partners is backed by HarbourVest, a US-headquartered private equity firm with more than $64 billion in assets under management; they have come in as the Limited Partner. Avataar Venture Partners was founded in July this year.


According to the founders of Avataar, this VC firm was founded on the belief that to successfully build, scale, and accelerate the growth of companies, entrepreneurs will need partners with operational action bias.
According to Mohan, they will work closely with leadership teams of the investee companies to help them scale their business.

As the first step, Avataar has acquired stakes in six B2B SaaS companies, Appnomic, Capillary, CRMNext, ElasticRun, Manthan, and Zenoti, from Norwest Venture Partners.

The founding partners of Avataar said, “With Avataar, we want to create an ecosystem of strong execution-focused partners who have built scale, have seen the story before and can bring timely learning from past successes and failures to our entrepreneurs. The fund will focus on bringing this as a key differentiator beyond capital. The partnership with HarbourVest will allow us to provide capital needed to scale our businesses.”


B2B startups and SaaS companies have strongly emerged as the key focus area for investors and a private equity giant like Tiger Global has made certain key investments in this segment in India.

After one instance of lynching, the government made it clear that they are not with the victim but with the perpetrators. Once this message spread, our dear Jharkhand is now known as 'Lynchistan' in the entire country," she told ANI.Speaking on the comments made by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat that no Hindu would be left out from the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the CPM leader said that RSS and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) just want to partition the country on the basis of religion.When asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US and the 'Howdy Modi' event, Karat said that it is not a positive sign if India determines its foreign policy keeping the US at the centre."What did our country get out of the 'Howdy Modi' event? Did India get back the Most Preferred Status in trade? If India determines its foreign policy keeping the US at the centre, it is definitely not in the interest of the country," she said. (ANI)

Facebook was quick to promise that its Libra cryptocurrency would have the stability of real-world money behind it, but whose money will dominate?  It's now particularly clear.  Facebook sent a letter to German politician Fabio De Masi explaining that the US dollar will represent 50 percent of the backing for Libra.  The remaining support will come from the euro (18 percent), Japanese yen (14 percent), British pound (11 percent) and Singapore dollar (7 percent).  If you were hoping for currency representation from more parts of the world, you'll be disappointed.
This isn't surprising given Facebook's home turf and the usual strength of the US dollar.  The absence of certain currencies might work in Libra's favor, too. The absence of China's yuan could appease American politicians scrutinizing the currency by assuaging their fears of Chinese influence.  US officials have long accused China of softening the yuan to help its exports, and Libra's mix would make that a non-issue.
Whether or not this balance (or rather imbalance) helps is another matter.  The backing should prevent the volatility that has plagued Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but France, Germany and other countries are worried Libra might undermine their own financial systems.  Rock-solid support might not matter so much if Libra isn't available in key countries, especially those countries that are supposed to underpin the virtual money in the first place.

Daily Mail
Doctors are investigating the strange case case of a woman who cries 'crystal tears.'
Satenik Kazaryan, 22, from Spandaryan village in Armenia, weeps up to 50 jagged-edged tears each day - and she says her condition is agony and has made her life 'hell.'
'I was at the dentist, and it seemed dust got into my eyes,' she said.
'It hurt me. I went to the ophthalmologist, and a few crystals were taken out from my eyes.
'Now my every day has turned into hell.'
Doctors are unable to figure out why Satenik Kazaryan, 22, from Spandaryan village in Armenia, cries 50 pointed tears every day. The condition is 'agony' and has 'made her life hell' 
Though medication helped Satenik at first, the condition soon worsened with tears starting to fall more rapidly. The doctors have not 'encountered such a disease before'
Some of the doctors believe it could be an increase in salt density but are unable to make a definite diagnosis for Satenik 
At first medication seemed to help but now the crystal tears are coming more frequently as shown on a video from Mir24.tv
'All the doctors are in shock,' she said.
'They have not encountered such a disease and do not know how to treat it.
'They have not even diagnosed it.'
Her relative Svetlana Avagyan said: 'When we removed the first crystal, we thought glass got into her eye during work on our farm.
'But the pain did not stop and we kept getting more crystals from her eyes.
'So we took her to the doctor.
'At first they did not believe us…. no-one here has seen anything like this before.'
Satenik's relative can be seen drawing one of the crystal tears from her eye using a cotton bud. Svetlana Avagyan said that she thought it was glass when they took the first one out
She has collected some of the tears in a box, as pictured above, where their jaggedness is apparent. The tears have been sent away for analysis but there have been no results back yet
One of her relatives, Svetlana Avagyan (pictured left), said that at first they thought the tears were a piece of glass. According to doctors, if the salt concentration increases in the tears, this 'can cause the acceleration of crystallisation'
One medic even told her to leave, believing she was faking her condition - but now it is accepted the crystal tears are natural, said her mother-in-law Zemfira Mikaelyan.
Specialists have sent the crystals for analysis but so far there is no diagnosis.
One idea was to send her abroad for diagnosis and treatment but reports say Satenik’s family are poor and work as peasant farmers.
Satenik's mother-in-law, Zemfira Mikaelyan, said that medics thought she may be faking the condition but they now realise the tears are real
A mother of one, she married at the age of 15.
Armenian deputy health minister Oganes Arutyunyan said the woman’s case is being studied.
'We plan one more meeting with Satenik, aiming to gather more information, and then we will try to figure out what is going on with the patient,' she said.
Russian ophthalmologist Tatyana Shilova told REN TV channel that the condition is very unusual but not unique.
'Such a pathology rarely happens, so doctors may have difficulty identifying the causes,' she said.
In certain situations - genetic or inflammatory diseases of the eye, but also of the body as a whole - changes in the composition (of tears) can occur.
'In a tear there are proteins, fats, micro-elements, it has a certain ionic composition.'
Satenik is from a poor village in Armenia and is the mother of a single child after marrying at the age of 15. There was an idea to send her abroad for treatment but her family are poor  peasant farmers who would be unable to afford the expense
If the salt concentration increases, this 'can cause the acceleration of crystallisation,' she said.
'Proteins in tears can also increase its density.'
She warned that the crystal tears may be a sign of other problems.
'Crystals appear not only from the side of the mucous membrane of the eye - they can form in the liver, kidneys, and settle in the form of salts in organs.
'This is dangerous and requires investigation,' she added.

Reuters
HARARE (Reuters) - Former Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe died from cancer after  chemotherapy treatment was stopped because it was no longer effective, a state-owned newspaper quoted President Emmerson Mnangagwa as saying, the first time the government has given the cause of his death. 
Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe to independence and crushed his foes during nearly four decades of rule that impoverished his  country, died on Sept 6. aged 95 in Singapore.  
Mnangagwa told ruling party supporters in New York where he is attending this week’s United Nations General Assembly that Mugabe had cancer, but he did not disclose the type. 
Mugabe is still to be buried because the government is building a mausoleum at Zimbabwe’s national shrine reserved for liberation war fighters in the capital. His body is being kept at his Blue Roof residence in Harare.     
“Treatment had stopped, doctors had stopped treatment, chemotherapy, one, because of age and also because the cancer had spread and it was not helping anymore,” Mnangagwa said in comments carried by The Herald newspaper on Monday. 
In 2011, WikiLeaks released U.S. diplomatic cable that said  Mugabe had prostate cancer that had spread to other organs, which government officials denied. 
During his time in power, and before he was forced to resign after a coup in November 2017, Mugabe frequently traveled to Singapore to seek treatment.

Hyderabad: After dabbling in and working with augmented reality (AR) for about a year, Radhakrisha B., a software engineer from Gitam university in Visakhapatnam was looking for ideas to create solutions with technology. A random conversation with someone about problems pertaining to indoor navigation sparked an idea. “Can AR provide more accuracy than existing systems?" he thought to himself.
Months later, Radhakrishna, managing director of Augmented Byte--a startup working out of the Hyderabad-based incubator T-Hub--is now creating products for indoor navigation.
What makes his work unique is that the navigation system he built is not dependent on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, but simply works based on the scanning of a unique image (from the starting point) to start the AR-based navigation in any given space.
“After that conversation, I went back and researched about indoor navigation, which is still a big question in the market. When you enter a complex structure like mall or a hospital, the GPS signal is blocked due to walls. Outside the marker is accurate. The other methods in the market use Bluetooth beacons and Wi-Fi hotspots for indoor navigation currently," explained Radhakrishna.
Pointing out that Bluetooth and Wi-fi signals do not provide dynamic location for indoor navigation, Radhakrishna said AR proved to be a more accurate tool. “Essentially we survey and create a map of the place to create the product. We create a unique image at the starting point inside the premises. It can be a small A-4 size image. We have a collection of 2000 pictures that can be used and if you have anything in mind, we can use that too," he said.
The easiest correlation to his product is the online game Pokemon Go, which took the world by storm a few years ago. Using Augmented Byte’s products give a similar feeling. A test video of the same shows a robot and a UFO appearing on one’s phone as guides for indoor navigation. After starting up the app and scanning the unique image, all one has to do is enter the destination within the premises.
“It works even in aeroplane mode. The UFO guides you, while the robot follows you and gives you analytics after you reach the destination," said Radhakrishna, who worked as a software engineer for Accenture till he quit in August 2018. But success for him didn’t come easy. After seeing not-so-satisfactory results at an event in Mumbai last year in October, he realised his product was far from perfect.
“I went back home in Hyderabad and thought of using a unique image instead. That worked, and I first tested it in the township I stay at Lingampally. After that I decided to file a patent for it. Right now, we are working on nine pilot projects, which include hospitals. We are hoping to close in on them as clients after the pilots are done," Radhakrishna informed. He added that he plans to target 35 to 40 hospitals in the coming one year, to look for prospective clients.
Radhakrishna had initially planned target the tourism sector, given how his product will be helpful to navigate places like forts and museums. But after he joined T-Hub in February this year, hospitals also showed keen interest in the AR-based indoor navigation system he developed. Radhakrishna now wants to expand his team, which comprises three employees and also wants to built a marketing team.
“So far we have bootstrapped and the pilots have been enough. We have not gotten any funding so far, but we are open to it," he added. While his competitors are bigger companies which also provide indoor navigation solutions like Indoo.rs and Infsoft, Radkhakrishna is confident that Augmented Byte will grow given its unique solution in terms of not requiring Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
“This is the first time I am hearing of such a product which does not require Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. AR exists in the market and has been catching up in the last five to six years. It took-off after Pokemon Go came, and everyone started learning about it. You even have AR marketing now and it is used even in employee training. Something like this can also be useful for in a music festival where people are there just for a few days," opined Abhijit Bhushan, a Hyderabad-based private AR and virtual reality (VR) developer.
In the coming days, Augmented Byte, which is part of T-Hub’s second batch of Lab32 (a six-month incubation programme), is looking to create an AR-based game like Pokemon Go and release it next month. “And in the next six months, we will concentrate on B2B (marketing)," Radhakrishna said.

The New Indian Express
PUNE: Senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar has said his party would like to forge an alliance with the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) for the next month's Maharashtra Assembly elections.
The VBA contested the Lok Sabha polls held earlier this year independently.
As a result, the Congress-NCP alliance and the VBA suffered losses, Pawar said.
"We are (now) trying to bring together like-minded people. We would also like to have an alliance with VBA," he said addressing a gathering here on Sunday evening.
The former state deputy chief minister said out of the total eight Assembly seats in Pune city, the NCP will contest four and the Congress-three.
Discussion is on for the remaining one seat and there is a possibility that it may be given to another ally, he said.
Pawar said many NCP activists are keen on contesting the Assembly polls, "but we can give tickets only to a limited number of aspirants".
Notably, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), which contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in alliance with the VBA, snapped ties with the Prakash Ambedkar-led outfit earlier this month.
NCP chief Sharad Pawar last week said his party and the Congress will contest 125 seats each out of the total 288 in the Assembly polls, scheduled to be held in a single phase on October 21.
As per the arrangement, 38 seats will be left for other allies to contest, he said, adding that the NCP will give chance to "new faces" in the polls.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: The Congress has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of violating Indian foreign policy's "time-honoured principle" of not interfering in the domestic elections of another country by campaigning for US President Donald Trump at the 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston.
In a series of tweets, Congress senior spokesperson Anand Sharma said Modi was in the US as India's Prime Minister and not a star campaigner in the US elections.
"Mr Prime Minister, you have violated the time-honoured principle of Indian foreign policy of not interfering in the domestic elections of another country. This is a singular disservice to the long-term strategic interests of India," Sharma said on Twitter after the Howdy Modi event in Texas on Sunday night.
"Our relationship with the United States of America have throughout been bipartisan, vis-à-vis Republicans and Democrats. Your actively campaigning for Trump is a breach of both India and America as sovereign nations and democracies," he added.
Sharma's party colleague, P Chidambaram, who is in Tihar jail on charges of alleged corruption, also took a dig at the prime minister over his "Everything is fine in India" remark in Houston.
"Bharat mai sab achha hai. Except for unemployment, loss of existing jobs, lower wages, mob violence, lockdown in Kashmir and throwing Opposition leaders in prison," Chidambaram tweeted through his family.

On Sunday night in Houston, PM Modi cheered for Trump's 2020 re-election bid, by saying "Abki Baar, Trump Sarkar", as the US president joined him at the mega gathering of over 50,000 Indian-Americans.
He also introduced US President as "my friend, a friend of India" and as someone who "has left a deep and lasting impact everywhere."
Trump returned the compliment during his remarks, lavishing praise on Modi and calling him "a great man and a great leader."
Welcoming Trump, Modi said, "We have met a few times, and every time he has been the same warm, friendly, energetic and accessible. I admire him also for his sense of leadership and passion for America."

"We in India connected well with President Trump and with the words of candidate Trump, 'Abki Baar, Trump Sarkar', rang loud and clear," Modi said, rephrasing his successful election slogan 'Abki Baar, Modi Sarkar'.
Trump responded with a smile.
Trump, a Republican, has already announced that he will seek a second term at the White House in the general elections in 2020.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Army along with Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (SMVDU) organised the first of its kind startup weekend aiming ‘to propel entrepreneurship growth in the region’ of Jammu and Kashmir. The programme culminated on Sunday at Udhampur.
The Army in its formal communication said, "The Counter Insurgency Force (Uniform) organized a Startup Weekend under the aegis of White Knight Corps in collaboration with Technology Business Incubation Centre (TBIC), Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (SMVDU)".
The three day startup weekend began on 20 September 2019 and culminated on 22 September 2019. To give them the exposure of real entrepreneurship, more than fifteen mentors/investors were invited from all over the country.
The goal, as per the Army, is to help the youth become job creators rather than the job seekers. Talking about the aim of the activity, the army in its release said, “The Startup Weekend was conducted with an aim to propel entrepreneurship growth in the region and witnessed large participation." The Indian Army, under its ‘Operation Sadhbhavana’ has been mentoring the youth of J&K to become ‘Job Creators rather than Job Seekers’, added Army.
Seniors officers of the Army and the University were present on Sunday while students of various university and colleges of Jammu and Kashmir and local entrepreneurs pitched their ideas during the event. “Major General D S Gill, Chief of Staff, Headquarter 16 Corps witnessed the event on 22 September 2019 and addressed the gathering. Major General Dhiraj Seth, General Officer Commanding, Counter Insurgency Force (Uniform) also interacted with the participants.” Army said.
“The participation by the students reflects the mind shift of youth of J&K towards entrepreneurship especially after the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A." Said Army.
All participants had 60 seconds each to pitch their ideas, these pitches were then whittled down to top ideas and teams were formed around the top ideas to come out with a prototype or a sale-able model/project. The Weekend culminated with the demonstrations in front of audiences of judges and potential investors.
Two workshops on ‘Minimum Viable Product and Prototype Creation’ and ‘Drive Sales Through Effective Communication and How to Pitch’ were a great success among the participants. Panel discussion on ‘Way ahead for Startup Ecosystem in J&K’ was also organised for non-participating visitors. The highlight of the event was the Investors Meet where the bootstrapped startups of the region were able to present their business model to the investors. This is the very first time that serious investors and mentors have interacted at the grass root level with the business owners.

The New Indian Express
KOLKATA: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday claimed panic surrounding the National Register of Citizens (NRC) issue and talk of it being implemented in Bengal in the saffron quarters has resulted in the death of six persons in the state.
She held the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) responsible for the deaths.
Also, in her first reaction to last week’s ruckus at Jadavpur University, during which Union Minister Babul Surpiyo was allegedly heckled and detained, the chief minister stood by the accused Leftwing students and had a go at the BJP MP without taking his name.

“People saw what he (Supriyo) did on campus. You may hoodwink people but not every time,” she said.
Claiming that the NRC will not be implemented in Bengal while addressing a meeting of trade unions in Kolkata, Mamata said, “It is because of the Assam Accord that NRC was implemented in the northeastern state. Fear and panic around NRC has already resulted in six deaths in Bengal. But rest assured, I will never allow a similar exercise here.”
“People have already started queuing up in government offices to collect documents attesting to their citizenship. I urge people not to panic,” she said, adding that talk of NRC implementation has resulted in the death of six persons.

Reuters
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Debt-laden Reliance Capital Ltd has slammed an Indian credit rating agency’s decision to downgrade its debt to “default” levels and warned the move would harm millions of investors. 
CARE Ratings late on Friday downgraded the non-banking financial company’s (NBFC) bonds to ‘D’ from ‘BB’, citing a one-day delay in coupon payments on several non-convertible debentures and stress in the group’s liquidity position. 
Reliance, headed by business tycoon Anil Ambani, however, said funds had been arranged by the due date and the delay was due to technical glitches in the bank’s servers. 
CARE “arbitrarily disregarded” the explanation and gave the company no opportunity to comment on the rating rationale, Reliance said in a statement to stock exchanges on Saturday. 
“The highly unprofessional, biased and prejudiced and unjustified actions of CARE will precipitate a chain sequence of events that will gravely harm the interests of millions of retail and institutional investors having direct and indirect exposure to securities of the company,” it said. 
CARE did not respond to requests for comment. 
The rating agency’s move may exacerbate fears of further stress in India’s shadow banking sector, which has faced a liquidity crunch following the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) a year ago. 
PwC resigned as Reliance Capital’s auditor in June, citing what it called a lack of information from the company. Reliance Capital said it had duly responded to the auditor’s queries.

Times Now
Bruna Abdullah had recently announced the birth of her daughter and named her Isabella. The model has now shared the story of the birth of her baby girl. Bruna chose to give birth at home and have a drug-free delivery. The model chose the hypno-birthing process and shares that she had a beautiful experience. She writes, “Even before I was pregnant I knew I would have a water birth! I wanted the birth of my baby to be as gentle as possible and without any drugs, I hated the idea of having to deal with the side effects of all the medication they would give me at the hospital.”
She further writes, “I imagined a calm and soothing environment, where I could wait for my baby to arrive, surrounded only by the people that made me feel good and excited about that moment. I was lucky enough to have had all that! I had my baby in a warm water pool, my husband, my mother, my doctor and my doula were there with me. I prepared myself for that day, I worked out regularly, I ate a very well balanced diet, I meditated and visualised every single detail. I wanted to deliver my baby on a Saturday, I wanted the labour to be no longer than 4 hours, I wanted to deliver my baby in the pool, and I wanted to do it drug free! I got all of that!”
Bruna also adds that she felt like a super hero after the birth of her baby. She adds, “I also asked for it to be pain free but that wasn’t really what happened!! Saying that, I feel like a super hero, kind of invincible, now I feel like I can do anything .. it was important to me to be fully in control, awake, for the arrival of my baby. I wanted nature to do its job! It was magical, I had to idea I was so strong, I felt everything with so much intensity, her descent, the contractions.. that as soon as it was over, the only thing I could feel was love and pure happiness! The pain vanished, I recovered in minutes, and I was able to enjoy her from the very first minute!”

Manhattan, US: Ryan Romero from Las Vegas started lining up outside Apple's new Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan from 6pm a day before it was going to be re-opened for public. He was the first person to shop at the Apple Store.
By the time the store’s gates were officially opened by Tim Cook, Apple CEO and Deirdre O’Brien, Apple senior VP of Retail at 8 am on 20 September, hundreds had gathered outside waiting to buy the latest Apple iPhones and Apple Watches as well as to get a glimpse of the expansive new store that now boasts more natural light, larger floor space for products and people and a higher ceiling that makes it look and feel more spacious.
The Fifth Avenue store is the first Apple store that will remain open 24 hours every day throughout the year. It will be managed by a staff of 900 (working in shifts) who can speak over 30 languages.
“It is incredible and feels out of this world. The design looks very Apple like--the overall ambience is amazing. I would like to spend more time and come back here again," said Tavit
from Turkey, another consumer who managed to get in early into the store to buy one of the new iPhones.
Designed by London based architecture firm Foster+ partners, the new store has some very unique design elements. Even as one walks to the plaza above the store, one can see 28 Honey locust trees, surrounded by linear water fountains and 18 mirror glass structures called Skylenses which from outside look like big circular seats. One can also see inside the store through the Skylenses.
At the centre of the plaza is the incandescent glass cube with a large Apple logo on top and the new cylindrical metal structure sticking out from below.
Customers can enter the store using the elevator inside the metal structure or they can take the new spiral steel and glass staircase.
With all these elements, Apple is trying to ensure that people won’t see it as just another store, but as another iconic public centre where people can sit, relax and learn new things about the Apple products they already have or they intend to buy.
"We wanted to re-imagine the plaza, and we have done that in a number of ways, (such as) by creating 18 skylenses and 62 skylights, whose primary function is to bring light into the store, but they serve more purpose than that particularly the skylenses. They are places where you can take seats and get away from the hustle and bustle of NewYork and enjoy the tranquil setting of the plaza," said Chris Braithwaite, senior director of retail design, Apple.
The location of the store in itself will provide Apple ample opportunities to engage with the local community. It is closer to some of the iconic locations of New York like Central Park, Times Square and is itself located in iconic Fifth Avenue. Some of the experiences available to users in the new store will be taking advantage of these landmarks.
For instance, with art walks, Apple will invite creators to outdoor sessions with Apple Creatives who will show them how to trace architectural elements, draw in 3D on iPad with Apple Pencil. Apple will be providing the devices to participants for these sessions. During music sessions in Central park, Apple Creatives will help participants record sounds of nature in the park and teach them to create their own tracks, new microphone techniques, how to add music and edit the recordings using apps like GarageBand on iPad.
In addition to the LED lit ceiling, small trees on the shop floor, the open glass structures that fills the store with natural light, the new staircase that provides a unique fun experience in itself as one walks down, the new Apple store has got some exciting experiences lined up as well.
At one end of the store, Apple has got a video wall with a giant TV screen and more than 50 seats facing it, for short 15 minute sessions, where customer can learn new things about their iPhones like how to adjust background blur while taking selfies, how to take a slofie or how to capture group selfie. In addition to the video wall, the store has two additional experience tables for smaller sessions.
“Every store around the World has Apple sessions ranging from photography, music, videos, coding and design. While some programs are the same everywhere, we did create four specific sessions for this store that are unique to Fifth Avenue and Manhattan, like taking selfies in Fifth Avenue, learning new camera feature on iPhone 11 Pro, creating soundscape in Central park, sketching iconic architecture," said Ashley Middleton, Head of Today at Apple Programming, Apple.
At the other end, there is room for music enthusiasts, with closed glass walls so the sound from the shop floor won’t get in the way while they try out the audio on the Apple Home Pod. There is a section dedicated to Apple Arcade as well in the middle of the store. Making the most of the space, Apple has got a bigger Genius table, where Apple experts can assist customers.
The iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max will be available in India starting 27 September.

Reuters
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japan’s new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, pledged on Sunday to mobilize young people to push his coal-dependent country toward a low-carbon future by making the fight against climate change “sexy” and “fun.” 
Koizumi was speaking on the eve of a United Nations climate summit in New York where activists plan to float a blimp showing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe emerging from a bucket of coal to protest Japan’s pans to build new coal-fired power plants. 
“In politics there are so many issues, sometimes boring. On tackling such a big-scale issue like climate change, it’s got to be fun, it’s got to be cool. It’s got to be sexy too,” Koizumi told a news conference in New York. 
“We are committed to realizing a decarbonised society, and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change,” he said. 
Japanese students in Tokyo were among the millions of young people who took to the streets on Friday to express the fear and outrage they feel over the failure of governments to control greenhouse gas emissions, which hit a record high last year. 
Considered a rising star on Japan’s political scene, Koizumi, 38, became the third youngest lawmaker to join a post-World War Two Japanese cabinet when Abe announced a reshuffle this month. 
The son of charismatic former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, he is regularly rated by voters as the lawmaker they would most like to see in the top job when Abe steps down.  
Although Japan is not due to speak at the climate summit on Monday, Koizumi said he was in New York to learn more about the state of negotiations on global greenhouse gas emissions and meet Japanese students. 
He was speaking alongside Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming, who had invited him to meet various companies and banks aiming to accelerate investment in clean energy projects in Asia.  
“It behooves the rest of the world to come together to support Japan, as well as the other Asian countries, to move beyond coal,” said Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who now leads Mission 2020, a campaign to accelerate climate action. 
“We need to make an extraordinary effort that will favor the new fuels that we all need to move in to,” she said. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has told governments they should only turn up to the summit if they came armed with more ambitious plans to cut carbon emissions under the Paris accord, which enters a crucial implementation phase next year. 
Guterres has also urged governments not to build any new coal power plants after 2020 - setting him at odds with Japan, which is the only G7 country to be adding coal-fired power generation capacity. Japan’s government and banks also play an important role in financing new coal plants elsewhere in Asia. 
Nevertheless, Koizumi said he wanted Japan to do more on climate, invoking his country’s role in forging the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty agreed in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997.  
“We haven’t taken the strong action and powerful leadership since then, but from now on, from today, we want to do more,” Koizumi said, without giving details. 
Koizumi sparked controversy shortly after being appointed when he told his first news conference that he wants Japan to close down nuclear reactors to avoid a repeat of the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011. Isshu Sugawara, newly-appointed as trade minister, responded by saying it would be unrealistic to rid Japan of nuclear power. 
Koizumi reiterated his opposition to nuclear power on Sunday. “I want to realize a society, a country, with no fear about the nuclear crisis,” he said. “But it isn’t easy, it’s a complicated issue. But I’ll try my best to reduce the nuclear power in the future.”

Times Now
The biggest blockbuster of 2019, so far, is Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani starrer Kabir Singh. A Hindi remake of the 2017 Telugu hit Arjun Reddy. Kabir Singh faced a lot of criticism from a section of the audience and film critics, who deemed it to be sexist and misogynist. Recently, Shahid Kapoor was present at an event where he talked about his career, the massive success of Kabir Singh and more. 
When asked about the film and how he approached the character, Shahid Kapoor explained, "If you think cinema is an educational institution that you're taught what you should or should not to do, that's your choice. Cinema is meant to mirror life. It's about representing the truth. It's an adult film, for adults, who can distinguish between right and wrong. Are you telling me that Mr Bachchan is someone who taught people to be a thief? You know you're going to watch a movie right, it's fiction, right? I've seen situations like this in life. When a couple fights, if a third person views it, they'll have a different idea. Fundamentally, they're in love. I've seen independent women date simple boys, and vice versa. That's how life is, it's unpredictable. Why is there a problem? You choose to take away what you want from the film. That's what democracy is all about."
He further added, 
We promoted the film for two months. If someone's bought a ticket, they probably wanted to see something in it. The film is about a flawed character. Preeti (Kiara Advani) is a stronger character than Kabir. Kabir doesn't know how to handle himself. Every Kabir needs a Preeti in his life. No one brought up Baazigar, when SRK kills Shilpa Shetty. No one said anything about Ranbir Kapoor putting a commode seat on Sonam Kapoor's neck as a mangalsutra in Sanju. Sab Kabir Singh ke peeche kyun pade hain?









The movie opened to mixed to positive response and collected Rs 278.24 crore at the box office. It is not only the highest-grossing film of the year but is also the 9th highest-grossing Hindi film of all time, inflation unadjusted.

Times Now
Washington DC: American actor Kevin Hart who sustained injuries in a recent car crash might face a lawsuit over the incident. The comedian is being blamed by those who got injured during the crash, including the driver and a second passenger, who say Hart showed negligence for not having critical safety features installed like airbags and safety harnesses, according to a report from TMZ.
The missing safeguards -- standard in more modern vehicles --were not common back in the 1970s, so Hart reportedly passed on them for an extra bit of authenticity.
The company who was behind in designing the car of Hart may also be on the hook for allowing the custom job to go through without seeing the safety norms, reported TMZ, which said a negligence claim could be rooted in the body shop's decision to go ahead with the job despite the lack of modern safeguards in the powerful, 720 horsepower engine vehicle.

Reuters
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malindo Air, the Malaysian subsidiary of Indonesia’s Lion Group, said on Monday that two former employees of its e-commerce contractor were responsible for its passenger data breach. 
Malindo Air confirmed the breach last week after Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky alerted users in Malaysia and Thailand. 
Kaspersky told Reuters in an email it had sent out an alert on Sept. 13, two days after the data breach was made public. 
Kaspersky said in its alert that the personal details of almost 46 million passengers of Malindo and Thai Lion Air, another Lion Group subsidiary, were posted online. Kaspersky said parts of the leaked databases were offered for sale. 
Malindo Air said in a statement that two former employees of e-commerce services provider GoQuo (M) Sdn Bhd in their development center in India “improperly accessed and stole the personal data of our customers”. 
Reuters could not immediately reach GoQuo for comment. Phone numbers for GoQuo’s offices in India and Malaysia listed on the company’s website did not go through. Malindo did not name the two former GoQuo employees. 
The airline said the data breach had been contained and the matter has been reported to the police in Malaysia and India. 
Malindo Air also said the breach was not related to the security of cloud service provider Amazon Web Services’ data architecture, and none of the payment details of customers were compromised.

Bengaluru: The latest corporate tax cuts announced by the finance ministry will the reduce cost of capital and incentivize more investments in the consumer Internet segment, according to tech startups and investors in the startup space. The Finance Ministry last week effectively reduced corporate taxes for domestic companies to 25%, down from around 30%.
Apart from this, the ministry also widened the scope of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities by allowing domestic companies to deploy CSR funds towards incubators in various fields such as science, technology, medicine, besides incubators promoted by Centre or state or any state-owned companies.
According to Saurabh Srivastava, Chairman of Indian Angel Network, tax cuts will effectively reduce the cost of capital for companies which will likely result in a greater influx of funding into Indian startups.
“Likewise, the decision of encouraging businesses to reroute their CSR 2% spending into state-sponsored incubators will further contribute towards driving innovation and entrepreneurship with renewed vigor," added Srivastava in a statement.
“With corporates being given further permissions to utilize the CSR funds for funding incubators, it will create a close synergy between the industry and the startup ecosystem. One of the areas to support in this would be to look at the startups and organizations which are helping disadvantaged youth to upskill. It will help uplift and upskill several capable engineers across the country," said Narayan Mahadevan, co-founder of Mumbai-based tech incubator BridgeLabz.
Apart from investors, tech startups in the financial and payments space welcomed the Indian government’s corporate tax cuts.
Kumar Karpe, chief executive of payment solutions company Ingenico ePayments said that industries such as banking (private and public) along with consumer finance companies will now have a surplus of funds available that can be re-invested in capital expenditure and in hiring. “With the current global economic slowdown and the headwinds experienced by India, this move will help India become an attractive destination for global investors," he added.
“The announcement by the Finance Minister in terms of slashing effective corporate tax to 25.17% inclusive of all cess and surcharge for domestic companies will greatly benefit Indian corporates, with the startup sector slated to see an inflow of investment…These measures will go a long way in not only augmenting local businesses but also spur the overall growth of the economy," said Bhavin Turakhia, chief executive of enterprise payments startup Zeta, and messaging startup Flock.
However, Dr. Arun Singh, Chief Economist at Dun and Bradstreet said that there is a sense of low business optimism, low returns on capital invested by the corporates in the non-financial sector and an increase in inefficiency in capital employed. “(This is) indicated by increasing incremental capital-output (ICOR) ratio, (which) raises concerns over the pace of revival in (corporate) investments. Investment demand indicated by a Gross fixed capital formation which used to be around 35% in 2013 has fallen to 32% currently," he added in a statement.

PATNA: The economy of the country is in fine fettle and has registered around 28 per cent rise in foreign investments, union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Sunday.
He was speaking before a gathering of businessmen and members of Bihar Industries Association's annual function.
"Everybody should know that the IT sector amongst others has witnessed highest investment that shows how the investors are sure of the emerging robust economy of India," Shankar said refuting the claims of economic slowdown.
Quoting recent decision of NDA government, Prasad said that taxes have been reduced from 34 per cent to 17 per cent in order to encourage 'Make In India' endeavour.
"India has become the world's second mobile manufacturing country following mammoth productions and subsequent demands of products," he claimed.
There are around 260 industrial units involved in manufacturing the parts and mobiles in the country, he said.
"Buoyed over the substantial growths in these sectors, the government of India is promoting manufacturing of electronic medical machines in order to make the country self-reliant in its production," he said.
Besides this, he informed the industrialists that East Central Railway has decided to construct five new platforms at Harding Park. "For this,postal department has also decided to exchange its land with the ministry of railway," he said.

The New Indian Express
CHANDIGARH: The Punjab Police claimed to have busted a terror module of the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), backed by a group based in Pakistan and Germany with the arrest of four people on Sunday. Police said the terror group was planning to unleash a series of strikes in Punjab and adjoining states.
Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta said the four members of the module were arrested from the outskirts of Chohla Sahib village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab on Sunday.
Those arrested have been identified as Balwant Singh, alias Baba, alias Nihang; Akashdeep Singh, alias Akash Randhawa; Harbhajan Singh and Balbir Singh.  
Both Akashdeep and Balwant Singh have a criminal past with multiple criminal cases against them, Gupta said.
“They were using a white Maruti Swift car bearing a Punjab registration number,” he said.  
A huge cache of arms, including five AK-47 rifles, pistols, satellite phones and hand grenades, was seized from them. According to Dinkar Gupta, the weapons were suspected to have been delivered recently from across the border by the ISI, state-sponsored jihadi and pro-Khalistani terrorist outfits working under its command.
With the initial investigation revealing the use of drones to deliver weapons and communication hardware across the border, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has urged the Union government to direct the Air Force and the BSF to launch necessary counter-measures.
Given the international links and ramifications of the conspiracy, Singh has decided to hand over the further investigation to the National Investigation Agency, an official spokesman said.

HOUSTON: Prime Minister Narendra Modi requested Indians living across the world on Sunday to send at least five non-Indian families to India as tourists every year.
Addressing a gathering of members of the Indian community here, he said, "Can you do something for me? It is a small request. I am saying this to all Indians living all over the world. You take a decision that every year, each one of you will send at least five non-Indian families to India as tourists."
The prime minister said this after unveiling the plaque of the groundbreaking ceremony for the Eternal Gandhi Museum here, the inauguration of the Gujarati Samaj of Houston Event Centre and a Siddhi Vinayak temple.
The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) posted video clips of Modi's address on Twitter.
"The Eternal Gandhi museum will be a prized cultural landmark in Houston. I have been associated with this effort for a while. It will surely make Gandhi Ji's thoughts popular among the youth: PM," the PMO said in a tweet.
Modi also thanked the Indian community in Houston for setting the stage for a "glorious future" of Indo-US ties, it said in another tweet.

Many companies are pouring money into renewable energy, but how many can say they're producing more than they need? IKEA thinks it will, at least. Its holding company Ingka revealed that IKEA will generate more renewable energy before the end of 2019 than the energy its stores use. The firm only expected to draw even by 2020. The furniture chain added that it had invested about $2.8 billion in solar and wind energy over the past decade, and told Reuters that it intended to continue funding that renewable tech, including two stakes in American solar farms this week.
The retailer expects to offer home solar panels in stores across all its markets in 2025. Ultimately, it plans to be climate-positive (reducing more emissions than it puts out) by 2030.
IKEA's timing isn't a coincidence. Like Google, Amazon and other companies, it's using both the Global Climate Strike and the UN's Climate Action Summit to build goodwill and avoid controversy. This isn't a selfless act. With that said, the move could illustrate the next step for companies hoping to burnish their ecological credentials. Instead of merely striving for neutrality, more companies might try to counter the effects of climate change. There's no guarantee they'll act in a timely fashion, but it might be more a question of "when" than "if."

Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday global oil prices would ease if there is no further escalation of geopolitical tensions. 
Oil prices had jumped by as much as 19% early last week before coming off peaks after an attack on oilfields of Saudi Arabia over the previous weekend disrupted 5% of global oil supply. 
The price of crude oil has already reduced by a few dollars per barrel, Pradhan said in Hindi at an industry event in New Delhi. 
Rising global oil prices are a major concern for India, the world’s third biggest oil importer, which meets almost 84% of its oil needs through imports.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Some WeWork board members, including officials tied to SoftBank Group Corp, are planning to try to push Adam Neumann to step down as chief executive, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The company's board is expected to meet as soon as this week and potentially consider a proposal for Neumann to become WeWork's non-executive chairman, which would allow him to stay at the company but inject new leadership to pursue an IPO, WSJ here said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alongside American President Donald Trump, addressed the Indian-American community at 'Howdy, Modi!', at the NRG Stadium in Texas’ Houston on Sunday. Besides US-India ties, Modi and Trump spoke about a number of topics as they addressed an audience of nearly 50,000. ‘Ab Ki Baar, Trump Sarkaar,’ Modi said in a loud voice, showing his clear support for Trump. The association between the two world leaders is indeed a matter of pride for Indians. Many from Bollywood celebrated the big moment by lauding Modi on social media. Among the ones who have shown support are Akshay Kumar, Anupam Kher, Anil Kapoor and Vivek Oberoi. Below see their tweets:
Akshay wrote, "‘Individually we are one drop. Together we are an ocean.’ A sea of people it was at the #HowdyModi event. India has truly arrived Globally! An absolute delight to watch PM @narendramodi ji saying ‘All is well’ in multiple regional languages truly representative of 1.3B Indians!"

The New Indian Express
MUMBAI: Union Home Minister and BJP national president Amit Shah on Sunday showered praise on Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for providing better facility and services to the people over last five years and said he would return as the next CM with a two-third majority.
Shah, who addressed a rally here to explain the union government’s decision on Kashmir, slammed the Congress-NCP led alliance for their opposition to abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A.
“People of Maharashtra should show the Congress, NCP their place for opposing the abrogation of the articles that ensured full and final integration of J&K with India. This is the first election after the removal of Article 370 and people of Maharashtra should decide whether they want to side with parties that espouse the cause of nationalism or promote their own dynasties,” Shah said while sounding the BJP’s Maharashtra Assembly poll bugle.

Shah also laid all speculations to rest about pre-poll alliance with the Shiv Sena by asserting that the BJP led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is all set to return to power in the state under Fadnavis on October 24.
While referring to NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s statement at Aurangabad that, “Maharashtra shall see a change in government if there is no Pulwama like incident”, Shah slammed him saying that the opposition tries to politicize all issues.
“For the last two-three days, the Congress and NCP people are saying if this/that doesn’t happen they will win… I want to tell you that the NDA government in Maharashtra will return with three-fourth seats,” Shah said.
Praising Fadnavis, Shah said that the Chief Minister has provided better services and facilities to the people of the state in the last five years. He said that in terms of education, the government has taken Maharashtra from 17th to third position and on investment, the state stands at Number 2.
He also credited Fadnavis for increased agriculture growth rate.
Shah’s statement assumes importance on the backdrop that the prevailing confusion over the BJP-Shiv Sena seat-sharing formula.

SpotboyE
Zareen Khan, who made her Bollywood debut opposite Salman Khan in the film Veer, was recently in the news for being body-shamed and trolled online for a recent picture that she had shared on Instagram. The picture, which showed stretch marks on her stomach, became the target for online trolling, and Zareen gave a befitting reply to the trolls. Recently, in an interview with ETimes, the actress was quizzed about a fun rumour she would like to spread about herself and her reply was, “A fun rumour I would like to spread is that Salman Khan is getting married to me.” 

Now, in an interview with Bombay Times, Zareen was asked about the story behind her statement and she clarified saying that she was asked about the best rumour she'd like to spread about herself and there could be no better rumour than this one. She further added that there is nothing more to it. The actress was also asked about fans' fixation on Zareen and Salman Khan and how many of Bhai’s fans even called her Bhabhi. Zareen Khan laughed and replied, "Well, most of those comments stopped after I did Hate Story (laughs!). Thank God for that!"  The actress has revealed that Salman Khan fans have thankfully stopped calling her Bhabhi after her bold avatar in Hate Story.


She also talked about her transition to films from playing the girl-next-door to a bold role. The actress said that after Veer and her dance number Character Dheela Hai, nothing changed for her until Hate Story happened. She added, "Hate Story was not an easy decision to make because I didn’t know whether people would accept me in such a bold role. But it turned out to be one of my biggest films. Public perception changes with every film. That’s the best part of being an actor. The plan is to look different in every film."

Zareen Khan will next be seen playing the role of a lesbian in the film Hum Bhi Akele Tum Bhi Akele directed by Harish Vyas. The film is scheduled for a Valentine's Day 2020 release.

The Financial Express
Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is on a three-day visit to Kashmir following Supreme Court orders, on Sunday visited Anantnag district in south Kashmir where he met people in a government housing colony. Azad, who was scheduled to meet people at Dak Bungalow which has been declared a jail, had to change the venue after authorities refused him permission, a local Congress leader said. “Azad was at the housing colony from 11.00 am to 3.00 pm. Many people came to meet him,” the leader, who wished not to be named, said.
He said while the leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha was strictly following the Supreme Court order with respect to his visit to the valley, authorities were creating hurdles. He alleged that during his stay in Srinagar on Friday, the security personnel did not allow people to meet him. Azad arrived here on Friday on his maiden visit following the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and after three failed attempts in which he was turned back from the airport. On Saturday, Azad visited Lalla Ded maternity hospital and inquired about the welfare of patients.
He also visited the Tourist Reception Centre here and interacted with the members of Kashmir Houseboat Owners Association. He is scheduled to visit Baramulla in north Kashmir on Monday. Azad’s visit became possible after a nod from the Supreme Court, which allowed the Congress general secretary to visit the state. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had on Monday allowed the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister to visit four districts — Srinagar, Jammu, Baramulla, Anantnag — to meet people.
The bench was told by senior advocate A M Singhvi, who was appearing for Azad, that the Congress leader wants to meet the people and inquire about their welfare. In his petition filed in “personal capacity”, Azad had told the Supreme Court that he had tried to visit the state thrice, but was turned back from the airport.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday, 22 September, released a list of 22 candidates for the next month's assembly polls in Haryana.
Three women have figured in the list released by AAP's Haryana unit president Naveen Jaihind.
In the Lok Sabha elections, AAP had an electoral understanding with the Jannayak Janata Party, a split-away faction of the Indian National Lok Dal.
After the Lok Sabha debacle, in which the alliance failed to win even a single seat, both parties parted ways.
The candidates fielded by AAP are the following:
AAP had not contested the assembly polls in 2014, in which the BJP came to power for the first time in Haryana.
The elections to 90 assembly seats in the state will be held on 21 October and the results will be declared on 24 October.

Daily Mail
Billionaire Larry Ellison ripped into Uber in comments to a group of entrepreneurs at his San Francisco home, dismissing the ride share company as a has-been that's vulnerable to competitors who are about to launch driver-less taxis.
Ellison, in the private discussion, was blunt about Uber. 
Even with a market capitalization of $57.5 billion after its initial public offering this May, Uber was still 'almost worthless,' said Ellison, according to Forbes, which reported about the meeting on Friday.
Billionaire Larry Ellison (above) ripped into Uber in comments to a group of entrepreneurs at his San Francisco home, dismissing the ride share company as a has-been that's vulnerable to competitors who are about to launch driver-less taxis
Ellison complained to the group of entrepreneurs that Uber doesn't own its vehicles and lacks control over its drivers
Even Uber's mobile app wasn't spared criticism from Ellison, who remarked the company has an app 'that my cat could have written'
Uber doesn't own its vehicles and lacks control over its drivers, he reportedly said, and it has an inferior app 'that my cat could have written.'
 'They have nothing,' he said about the company. 'No technology. And no loyalty.'
It's not clear whether the words of the wealthy and influential founder of technology giant Oracle will have an impact on the market. However, Uber's stock price already has dropped almost 20% since it first began trading.
Uber, addressing its problems, has told investors that it plans to cut ride discounts to help boost its business and will instead refocus on competing against Lyft on the merits of its product. 
Ellison doesn't see to be convinced by the company's efforts. 
He spent about an hour talking to his guests, answering questions about other firms as well, including WeWork, and Tesla. 
Tesla, he said, might give Uber a run for the money. 
Ellison, who joined Tesla's board of directors in December, says the electric auto maker is preparing to launch a fleet of 1 million, driver-less, robo taxis. 
Once on the road, they are expected to cut taxi fares by as much as two thirds, he says.
Tesla in August said it was to start selling car insurance to its customers in California in a move that could see the electric car company covering the driver-less taxi fleet. 
Ellison warned Uber wasn't prepared to fend off competitors, including Tesla which plans to launch 1 million, driver-less robo taxis that will significantly cut fares
The expansion announced in August came four months after Tesla CEO Elon Musk told analysts the company would branch into insuring its own cars for people who buy or lease them.
Musk believes the automaker has learned so much about its cars that it will be able to offer rates 20 per cent to 30 per cent below those offered by traditional insurers.
Although the insurance is only being sold in California to start, Tesla plans to offer coverage throughout the US at a later undisclosed state.

Reuters
(Reuters) - U.S. trade regulators on Friday approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions filed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) amid a broader reprieve on levies on computer parts, according to a public docket published by the U.S. Trade Representative and a Federal Register notice. 
The move by U.S. officials could make it easier for both Apple and small makers of gaming computers to assemble devices in the United States by lowering the costs of importing parts. 
Apple did not say why it requested the exemptions, but the requests were for components such as partially completed circuit boards. Apple manufactures its Mac Pro computers in Texas, making the machine immune from tariffs, but such intermediate parts were subject to the levies. 
Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. 
The Mac Pro computer starts at $6,000 and is intended for users such as music and motion picture studios. Due to its specialized design, the device has never sold in large numbers. But it became a political flashpoint earlier this year when The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was moving production to China. 
Apple never publicly commented on its exact production plans, but U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods complicated the assembly of PCs in the United States. The third list of U.S. tariffs that went into effect last year placed levies on both some fully assembled PCs as well as the major components to make them, meaning manufacturers faced cost increases even if they made machines in the United States.  
The tariffs also hit the PC gaming industry, where enthusiasts often assemble their own custom machines from parts, many from China. 
Apple applied for the exemptions for some components but President Donald Trump said U.S. regulators would not grant them. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook later said during the company’s July 30 earnings call that Apple wanted to keep making Mac Pros in the United States. 
“We want to continue to be here,” he told analysts on the call, adding that Apple was investing in capacity to do so. 
On Friday, trade officials lifted tariffs on a range of computer components for Apple and all other manufacturers, including partially assembled main circuit boards and graphics cards. Those are critical to computer assemblers because they contain chips from Intel Corp (INTC.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O). Those chips are typically some of the most expensive parts in the machines.

The New Indian Express
GUWAHATI: An influential organisation of the Gorkhas on Sunday said the Gorkhas, left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, will not file appeals in the various foreigners’ tribunals to challenge their exclusion.
“The Gorkhas of Assam won't go to the foreigners’ tribunals to prove their citizenship,” Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangha (BGP) national president Sukhman Moktan told reporters here.
He said to try the Gorkhas in the tribunals would be an insult on their Indianness.
“We can file a defamation suit against the system for challenging the citizenship of the Gorkhas and Nepali-speaking population by way of taking them to the courts of the tribunals,” Moktan warned.
There are no official records to suggest the number of Gorkhas excluded from the NRC. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and a rights organisation had, however, claimed that it was to the extent of one lakh.
The BGP represents some 10.5 million Gorkhas of India. During a week-long tour of Assam which concluded on Sunday, its leaders met NRC victims and the “arbitrarily-marked” “doubtful voters” and their descendants whose citizenship is challenged even after a notification of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, issued last year, exempted the Gorkhas from being tried in the foreigners’ tribunals.
“This is an attempt of a few vested interests within the system to disrespect Indian Gorkhas who are actually original inhabitants as is proven by our historically-recorded presence since centuries,” Moktan said.
Asked if the BGP has any plans to drag Assam government to the Gauhati High Court for the delay in filing fresh writ petition in proper bench to uphold the MHA notification, BGP’s Assam unit president Nityananda Upadhyay said, “The BGP is one of the parties of the NRC case in the Supreme Court. If the Assam government doesn’t do its duty as directed by the Union of India, the BGP will take a policy decision to take the matter to the apex court”.

ANI
Hong Kong, Sept 22 (ANI): A group of protestors in Hong Kong on Sunday trampled on the Chinese national flag and threw it into the Shing Mun river.They also smeared paint on the flag as bystanders cheered and applauded, reported Straits Times.The demonstrators raised slogans such as  "Hong Kong people, keep it up", "Fight for freedom", and "Liberate Hong Kong".The protests entered the 16th week with radical demonstrators vandalising the New Town Plaza shopping centre and setting fire to barricades they built on the road outside.Two subway stations were closed in the area by the authorities. Police hoisted a black flag to warn the protestors that they could use tear gas. The riot police, in a statement, asked the demonstrators to stop "illegal acts" and leave immediately.  Since June, Hong Kong has seen weeks of anti-government protests that began against a now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed criminals to be sent to mainland China for trial.The agitations have since broadened to include calls for democracy, police accountability and the resignation of chief Carri Lam, who is backed by Beijing.Protesters and police have clashed with both sides using force in the Asian financial hub.China has decried the protests and threatened military action in the semi-autonomous city, with a Chinese official alleging that the demonstrations have "begun to show signs of terrorism".Hong Kong functions under the 'one country, two systems' rule and was handed back to China by Britain in 1997.

Reuters
BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands marched in Slovakia’s capital on Sunday calling for a total ban on abortions in the predominantly Catholic central European country. 
Abortion laws in Slovakia are relatively liberal compared to those in countries like Poland or Malta, which have among the strictest laws in the European Union and often allow them only in cases like rape.  
In Slovakia, on-demand abortions are legal up until 12 weeks of a pregnancy while abortions for health reasons are allowed until 24 weeks.  
Conservative and far-right lawmakers want to allow them only to up to six or eight weeks of pregnancy or ban them outright, and parliament starts debating draft laws to restrict abortions this month. 
It is unclear if the proposals will become law since the ruling Smer - a leftist, socially conservative party - and junior center-right Slovak National Party in the government, have not said whether they will back any of them. 
Abortions have fallen in the country of 5.4 million to 6,000 last year, from almost 11,000 a decade ago. A Focus agency opinion poll this month found 55.5% of people disagreed with restricting abortions while 34.6% supported the move. 
Protesters carrying signs saying “A human is human regardless of size” and “Who kills an unborn child kills the future of the nation” marched in the capital on Sunday demanding a total ban on abortions, including in cases of severe birth defects or rape.  
“The life of every human is invaluable, therefore it needs to be protected from conception until natural death,” one of the protest organizers, backed by the Catholic church, said on stage.  
The organizers estimated turnout at the protest at about 50,000.   
The ruling Smer party has led Slovakia nearly non-stop since 2006 and has built its base by lifting social benefits amid years of economic growth and backing conservative issues.  
Ahead of an election next year, the party pledged to back legislation to ban gay marriage and adoption by same-sex couples. Slovak law does not recognize same-sex civil unions. 
The most recent official census in 2011 found 62% of the country identify as Roman Catholics, while 6% are Protestants.

By Amanda Becker and Jonathan Landay 
DES MOINES, Iowa/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, on Saturday called for an investigation into reports that President Donald Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. 
“This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power. To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things … this is outrageous,” a visibly angry Biden said while campaigning in Iowa. 
“Trump is using this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum and is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,” Biden said. 
Trump’s July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is at the center of an escalating battle over a whistleblower’s complaint reportedly concerning the U.S. leader’s dealings with Ukraine that the administration has refused to give Congress. 
The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets on Friday said Trump repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Biden, while vice president, threatened to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden’s son was involved was fired. 
Trump, reports said, urged Zelenskiy, a comedian who had just won election, to speak with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, has promoted the allegations against Biden and his son, Hunter, and acknowledged that he pressed for a Ukrainian investigation. 
Biden has admitted threatening to withhold aid unless the prosecutor was dismissed, a demand also made by the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases. 
The news reports about the Zelenskiy phone call have intensified demands by Democratic lawmakers for the House of Representatives to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, and have elevated the controversy to a major campaign issue. 
Trump denied doing anything improper. He wrote in a series of tweets on Saturday that his conversation with Zelenskiy was “perfectly fine and routine.” He accused the “Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party” of staying “as far away as possible” from the Biden allegations. 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko on Saturday denied in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet suggestions that Trump had pressured Zelenskiy. 
Biden, responding to a reporter’s question at the Polk County Democratic Party’s annual steak fry in Des Moines, denied that he had ever spoken to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine. 
“You should be looking at Trump. Everybody looked at this and everybody who’s looked at it said there’s nothing there. Ask the right question,” continued Biden. “You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?” 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of Biden’s main rivals in the Democratic primary race, reiterated in Des Moines that she believes Trump’s reported actions should be the subject of impeachment proceedings in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
“It is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now,” Warren said in remarks at the steak fry. 
At the steak fry, Biden called on voters to oust Trump but did not mention Ukraine. “Above all else we must defeat Donald Trump period and stop his abuse of power,” Biden said. 
The House Intelligence Committee is demanding it be given the whistleblower’s complaint in line with a finding by the inspector general for the intelligence community that the matter met the legal threshold for transmission to Congress. 
Acting Director of National Security Joseph Maguire, however, decided against providing the complaint to the committee after he consulted with the Justice Department, and reportedly the White House. 
Maguire and his top lawyer contended the complaint did not meet the legal guidelines for submission to the committee, prompting Democrats to accuse Maguire of breaking the law. 
Three House committees already were investigating the Trump-Zelenskiy call in part because the Ukrainian government’s readout of the call appeared to show that he had encouraged Zelenskiy to pursue a Biden investigation.

KABUL (Reuters) - A Taliban delegation met China’s special representative for Afghanistan in Beijing to discuss the group’s peace talks with the United States, a spokesman for the Islamist insurgency said. 
The meeting, on Sunday, comes after U.S. President Donald Trump’s 11th-hour cancellation earlier this month of negotiations with the Taliban, which many had hoped would pave the way to a broader peace deal with the Afghan government and ending an 18-year war. 
The Taliban’s nine-member delegation traveled to Beijing and met Deng Xijun, China’s special representative for Afghanistan, said Suhail Shaheen, the Afghan group’s spokesman in Qatar, on his official Twitter account on Sunday. 
Qatar was where the Taliban and the United States held peace talks over the past year. 
“The Chinese special representative said the U.S.-Taliban deal is a good framework for the peaceful solution of the Afghan issue and they support it,” Shaheen wrote. 
Mullah Baradar, the Taliban delegation’s leader, said they had held a dialogue and reached a “comprehensive deal”, Shaheen tweeted. 
“Now, if the U.S. president cannot stay committed to his words and breaks his promise, then he is responsible for any kind of distraction and bloodshed in Afghanistan,” Baradar said, according to Shaheen. 
Speaking in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed that Baradar and several of his assistants came to China for exchanges in recent days. 
“China’s relevant foreign ministry official exchanged opinions with Baradar regarding the situation in Afghanistan and promoting Afghanistan’s peace and reconciliation process,” Geng said.

Times Now
Actor Suniel Shetty has seen ups and downs in his showbiz career. He says failure has taught him a lot.

"When I started my career as an actor, I had no guidance from anyone. I have learned everything from my failures. I was very happy when my first movie was successful. That success paired with my trained body allowed me to believe and dream that I would be the next Amitabh Bachchan in the industry. Unfortunately, it remained a distant dream," said Suniel, who made his Bollywood debut with the 1992 movie "Balwaan".

"Moreover, I received a lot of criticism from people who told me that I cannot act and should go back to being a hotelier. I am glad that I took their criticism positively, moved past that and focused on what the audience wanted me to do," he added.

The actor has been roped in by Tata Sky Acting Adda for the show Khel Khel Mein to share his experience and learning with the budding actors participating on the show.

Further talking about his journey as an actor, Suniel said: "There was a phase when I cried for days and doubted my decision to be an actor when my films were not doing well.

"But soon I stood up and decided to do something that could set me apart. I decided to excel in what others didn't have, I focused on my actions and my fitness. I used to perform stunts that made me stand distinctly among my peers. My experience and my failure, both, have taught me to be a better performer and that is my journey so far," said the Border actor.

The New Indian Express
HYDERABAD: An exclusive portal for the sale of movie tickets will be launched very shortly by the Telangana state government under the supervision of the State Film Development Corporation (FDC). All the private online ticket sellers will be routed through the FDC site.
This will have two benefits. First, the black marketing of tickets will be avoided. Second, the government will get Goods and Services Taxes (GST) without evasion.
In an informal chat with reporters at the lobbies of the Assembly on Saturday, Cinematography Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav said that the government would take the control of online ticket sales. He said that some private online portal organisers were not showing the actual accounts for the sale of tickets and not paying the GST due to the State government. Once, the FDC portal was launched, all the private online movie ticket sites would be compulsorily routed through the FDC site. This will give no scope for the evasion of GST.

According to sources, the Central government too directed all the State governments to start the online sale of movie tickets under the control of government bodies like FDC. Accordingly, several states like Tamil Nadu initiated the process. Telangana too will follow the same model very shortly. The film industry too is not against the online sale of tickets by FDC.
Talasani said that the State government was studying the new model and discussing with the stakeholders. If the sale of tickets were routed through the FDC site, the accounts would be accurate and the government would get its share of GST. Talasani even had reservations over the faulty accounts being submitted by several sites like Book My Show.
The Minister also recalled that the government conducted raids on the race course thus, the betting tax increased from Rs 30 lakh in the past to Rs 3 crore now, per year. He averred that once FDC's online portal was launched, the income through GST on movie tickets would increase considerably. The GST on movie tickets is currently 28 per cent.

The T20 Blast 2019 saw the Essex county winning the finals and lifting their first Blast title. The Essex Eagles, as the T20 team is known, had made it into the finals by beating Derbyshire in the second semi-final. They faced Worcestershire, who defeated Nottinghamshire in the first semi-final.
The tournament was filled with excitement and amazing performances from the majority of the players, but the best of the best came from Essex Eagles’ captain Simon Harmer, who starred in both the knockout wins for his team. He had earlier picked 4/19 against Worcestershire in the semis and then managed to one-up himself in the finals, contributing with the bat as well as the ball.

Worcestershire had been put in to bat after losing the toss, put on 145/9 with Rikki Wessels and Moeen Ali making scores in the 30s. Simon Harmer picked 3/16 and Ravi Bopara took 2/30. In the reply, Tom Westley slammed 36 in 31 balls, but quick and cheap wickets of Delport, Wheater and Ten Doeschate put Essex in trouble.
But then Ravi Bopara (36*), combined with Paul Walter (14) and skipper Simon Harmer (18*) to take his team to their first-ever T20 Blast title. For Worcestershire, Ali and Parnell picked two wickets each, but it was not enough. However, the most hilarious thing was seen in the aftermath of the win, as Essex were handed over the trophy and the team members gathered for the photo-op, someone was missing in person in the lineup, but we’re still there for the picture.
Adam Zampa, Essex’s Australian recruit had to leave the tournament midway to take part in the Marsh Cup. He was sorely missed as he had partnered with Harmer to form a deadly frontline spin attack that helped the champions on their journey to the finals. When the team got together for the photo-op, Essex team used a cardboard cutout of Zampa who missed the knockout stage of the Blast. The cutout was hilarious and showed Zampa celebrating a wicket in Hulk style.

“We’re always told we’re a small club but we have the chance to win the double and I think we’ve shown we’re a force to be reckoned with, Harmer was quoted as saying by the Guardian. Meanwhile losing captain Moeen Ali said, “I thought they deserved to win. At one point, I thought we were winning the game but the way Ravi played was fantastic and basically won the game. As long as he was in, I always thought they were going to win.”

The Financial Express
Senior Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday slammed the Modi government over rising incidents of mob violence and deaths in the country. Speaking at an event in Pune on Sunday, he said that killing someone in the name of Hindu religion is an insult to the religion and Lord Ram, news agency ANI reported.
Tharoor said that the killings in the name of religion have seen a sudden rise in the last six years. He said that it all started with the killing of Mohsin Shaikh in Pune and then Mohd Akhlaq was killed because he was carrying beef.
“But it was reported later that it was not beef. Even if it was beef who gave anyone the right to kill a person?” he asked at an event of All India Professionals Congress (AIPC) in Pune on Sunday.
“Is this our Bharat? Is this what Hindu Dharam says? I am a Hindu but not of this kind,” he said.
The Congress leader noted that attackers also ask the victims to chant ‘Jai Sri Ram’.
“This is an insult of Hindu dharma and of Lord Ram that someone uses his name to kill another person,” ANI quoted the Congress leader as saying.
He said that Pehlu Khan, a Haryana resident, had the licence to transport cattle, but he was also lynched. Without taking the name of the BJP, he said, “One election result gave so much power to such people that they do anything and kill anyone.”
On the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) idea of Hinduism, the Congress MP said that “it is a political ideology and does not have any connection with Hinduism”.
On the row over a common language in the country, the Thiruvananthapuram MP said that he was in favour of a three-language formula.

The News Minute
“What are the challenges to our cultural practices in the name of secularism?” This is not a right wing Twitter handle out to create some ruckus – this was a real question asked to the country's top civil services aspirants by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) in one of the exams conducted by the authority on Saturday.
The UPSC conducts exams to recruit candidates to serve in top government posts through various service exams. The Civil Services Mains exam is one such exam which is written by aspiring bureaucrats who have cleared the prelims for the same. UPSC conducts these exams every year across the country, and this year the mains exam is scheduled from September 20 to 29.
In the General Studies Paper 1 given on Saturday morning, candidates were shocked to find a rather controversial question in their paper. The question was on the “challenges” to India's cultural practices “in the name of secularism.” This question, in an exam that looks for the future administrators of India, seemed to insinuate that secularism was an excuse which is posing challenges to the country's existing cultural practices.
Commenting on the matter, Kannan Gopinathan – an IAS officer who quit the services recently over the clampdown in Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370, commented on Twitter: "Indian secularism is a positive concept, taking along and encouraging all the cultural practices while instilling a scientific temper against superstitions and harmful practices.", would have been the first sentence of my answer!”
"Indian secularism is a positive concept, taking along and encouraging all the cultural practices while instilling a scientific temper against superstitions and harmful practices.", would have been the first sentence of my answer! https://t.co/MUsCYlh0OZ
This question comes as a part of a series of questions which prime candidates to think in a right-wing manner, alleges a student who wrote the exam on Saturday, requesting anonymity. "A few questions before this one, they had asked, “What makes Indian society unique in sustaining its culture”; and a few questions before that, there was, “Did Indian renaissance play a role in the emergence of national identity” etc.," he says.
Adding that there have been instances of UPSC doling out controversial questions earlier as well he says, "Those would be neutrally worded. There is a subtle difference between wording it neutrally and loading it," he says.
Slamming the UPSC for including such questions, the student said that the Commission needs to be pulled up for this. “I understand that the idea of secularism is under attack. But there is no academic consensus, nor is there a judicial consensus about this. Judiciary still says that secularism is a basic tenet of our Constitution. That is what we need to stick to. UPSC is a Constitutional body, not an independent think tank framing question for their intern. UPSC must stick to Constitutional values and definitely deserves brickbats for this," he says.
Another student, who also wrote the exam on Saturday, says that the question was unexpected and antithetical to one's understanding of secularism. "The question has a very limited scope. Apart from conflicts between the morality of a religion and the morality of a nation, there is not much to explain in the answer to this question," he says. He adds that this was one of the most difficult questions asked this time. "This was a loaded question. interpretation of the question is a challenge in itself and then comes winding the arguments around the aspects asked in the question," he says.
Ramesh Chennithala, former President of Kerala Congress and the present Leader of Opposition in Kerala also commented on the issue on his Twitter account by stating that UPSC is the latest casuality of RSS agenda. 
One of the most rated exam in the world UPSC,is the new casuality of the RSS agenda of instilling venom of communalism into the democratic institutions.#StopSaffronisingConstitutionalBodies pic.twitter.com/duMZBeSBil
Its irony that the UPSC finds the term "secularism" which is part of the preamble of our Constitution, as challenging to Indian Culture.#StopSaffronisingConstitutionalBodies

The Quint
Nobel Peace Prize laureates Mairead Maguire, Tawakkol Abdel-Salam Karman and Shirin Ebadi have written to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation expressing their objection to presenting the Global Goalkeeper Award to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
They pointed that since the BJP has come to power, there have been consistent attacks on minorities - Dalits, Muslims, Christians. “The use of organised mobs to respond to alleged sectarian ‘offences’ with violence has undermined the rule of law,” the letter read.

They wrote that Modi’s regime brought about a communication blackout in Kashmir, Assam NRC where 1.9 million Indians have been stripped of citizenship, and 2002 Gujarat riots, which are reasons good enough for the foundation to rescind their award to Modi.Talking about the riots, the letter read, “Modi was banned from entering the United States, the UK and Canada for 10 years until he acquired diplomatic immunity by becoming India's Prime Minister.”
The laureates appreciated the work by the foundation for improving the lives of many people in a sustainable manners and expressed admiration for Mahatma Gandhi for the way he built India. And so, they insisted that it was necessary to not give out this award and send out a powerful message that ‘Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation takes its aim of equity, justice, and human rights for all seriously.’

Meanwhile, Gates Cambridge scholars and alumni condemned the foundation for lauding PM Modi for the Swachh Bharat Mission, saying “ignoring the gross violation of human rights under his regime is reprehensible.”
“At the time of writing this letter, there are seven million Kashmiris under military siege lasting for over 40 days. Several media sources have reported on the inhuman conditions in the state, including house arrests, detentions, humiliation, and complete isolation of Kashmiris,” read the plea. They even pointed at the prime minister’s silence regarding “the rise of Hindu nationalist sentiments and consequent violence against minorities in the country”.

Talking about the Swachh Bharat Mission, the group wrote that these are ‘only diversionary tactics, reliant in large measure on media publicity rather than social change.’“Ramon Magasaysay Awardee and founder of Safai Karamchari Andolan (SKA or the Sanitation Workers’ Movement), Bezwada Wilson, has condemned the Swacch Bharat Mission for its disregard of institutional discrimination against Dalits and their deaths from manual scavenging. He says, ‘Toilet construction will not help us and will, in fact, push us back into manual scavenging, unless the entire exercise is mechanised and well thought out with proper planning,’” read the letter.

Cricket Country
The Central Crime Branch (CCB) has summoned four cricketers who participated in the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) in relation to the match-fixing scandal that has brought the state T20 league under scanner.
The four cricketers, whose names haven’t been disclosed, were allegedly in touch with Belagavi Panthers owner Ali Asfak Thara who has already been questioned by the CCB.
According to Deccan Chronicle, Ali was in touch with the cricketers representing other teams even when his own team was playing.
However, what role the cricketers had to play in this scandal is yet to be established.
“The inquiry is still at its initial stages and a detailed investigation is required. We will seek the assistance of Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) and the anti-corruption unit of the BCCI too,” Bengaluru Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Sandeep Patil was quoted as saying by the English daily.
The report further quoted an unnamed Karnataka State Cricket Association official as saying that the board will fully cooperate with the investigations.
The Indian cricket has been recently hit by multiple reports of suspicious approaches by India women cricketers and match-fixing allegations in the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL).
Players have shared with BCCI’s Anti-Corruption Unit screenshots of WhatsApp conversations where unknown people, posing as fans asked for information related to match and team combinations.
The ACU last week filed a First Information Report (FIR) at the Ashok Nagar Police Station in Bengaluru against Rakesh Bafna and Jitendra Kothari for an alleged attempt to fix an India-England women’s international match earlier this year.

Google has rolled out Incognito Mode to Maps' preview group for testing, so you may not have to wait that long to be able to use it. The feature was one of the privacy-focused tools Google promised at I/O earlier this year along with Incognito Mode for Search. Like the version of the feature on Chrome, it can make sure that any location or direction you look up doesn't get associated with your Google account. 
According to DroidLife, testers received an email about the rollout that says: "Use Incognito Mode when you don't want your activity -- like the places you search for or navigate to -- to be saved to your Google account."  The tech giant has been working to bring the feature to its other products for a while, releasing it for YouTube last year.
In Maps, you can switch it on by tapping on your profile photo on the right corner of the search bar and choosing "Turn on Incognito Mode" from the options that pop up. The app will then confirm your status with a black bar at the top of the screen that says "Incognito Mode is on." 
Coming soon to @googlemaps, when you turn on Incognito mode in Maps, your activity—like the places you search or get directions to—won't be saved to your Google Account. Just tap from your profile picture to easily turn it on or off. #io19 pic.twitter.com/z7GRkkmDbn

ANI
Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], Sept 22 (ANI): Karnataka Revenue Minister and BJP leader R Ashoka on Sunday said that the party "will not forget the sacrifice made by the disqualified MLAs", who are apparently the reason behind the formation of BS Yediyurappa-led government in the state.Ashoka was at the Bengaluru airport to receive BJP working president JP Nadda when he made the statement.He further hinted that the disqualified JD(S) and Congress MLAs will be "compensated in one way or the other" and that the party will not "leave their hand" for the support they provided. He also alleged that they are currently waiting for the hearing of the disqualified MLAs in the Supreme Court.The Karnataka Minister further said that both Congress and JD(S) cannot fight any election together because the whole state knows how Congress "betrayed" JD(S) in Mandya Lok Sabha election.This comes a day after the Election Commission on Saturday announced that the by-elections for 15 Assembly constituencies in Karnataka will be held on October 21, while the counting of votes will be held on October 24.Earlier, sources said that the disqualified MLAs would contest the by-elections in a tacit understanding with the BJP which could pose problems for the Congress.Former Speaker Ramesh Kumar had disqualified 17 MLAs including 13 from the Congress, 3 from the JD(S), and an Independent. Prominent among the Congress MLAs who were disqualified were MTB Nagaraj, K Sudhakar, Munirathna, Shrimant Patil, Byrathi Basavaraj and others.On the other hand, Supreme Court on September 12 refused to pass an order on a plea to list a batch of petitions filed by 17 disqualified MLAs challenging their disqualification from the Karnataka Legislative Assembly by the former Speaker under the anti-defection law rejecting their resignation and disqualifying them from the Assembly.The leaders were disqualified by the Speaker, stating that they have "incurred disqualification under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution (anti-defection law) and the disqualification would last till the end of the term of the Assembly May 23, 2023."

Uber isn't about to sit quietly while New York City extends its caps on ridesharing.  The company has sued NYC in a bid to halt rules that both freeze the number of new for-hire licenses and limit the amount of time drivers can spend cruising Manhattan looking for rides.  It contended that the cruising rule, which will cap the roaming ratio to 31 percent of drive time by July 2020, would "threaten the viability" of ridesharing.  The rates were determined using "flawed and arbitrary" models, Uber said.
Mayor Bill de Blasio's office defended the measures, which were intended to reduce traffic and clear streets for buses, bikes and pedestrians.  A spokesperson contended that the moves were both legal and provide "needed relief" to both NYC streets and existing drivers.
Uber and rivals like Lyft have acknowledged that their services can make traffic worse.  However, they've typically wanted to alleviate the burden on their own terms, and that has typically meant avoiding caps.  They're unlikely to simply accept the rules, and it's not clear that a compromise is on the horizon.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: As many as 19.96 lakh ghost beneficiaries have been identified at Anganwadi centres in Assam through a daily headcount, according to an RTI query.
In Assam, there are a total of 62,153 Anganwadi centres in which 36,24,973 beneficiaries, including 5,94,296 pregnant women and lactating mothers, are enrolled.
The Centre has asked all states to conduct headcount of all beneficiaries of Anganwadi centres, a type of rural childcare centre set up by the government to combat undernutrition and stunting among children below the age of six years and also meet nutritional needs of pregnant and lactating women.
In reply to an RTI query, the Women and Child Development Ministry said a total of 19.96 lakh ghost beneficiaries (both children and pregnant women and lactating mothers) have been eliminated from the Anganwadi services in Assam while a report from other state governments are still awaited.
The ministry further said the beneficiaries under the Anganwadi Services Scheme are identified on the basis of Aadhaar which is used as identity document for delivery of services or benefits in a bid to bring transparency and efficiency.
"The beneficiaries not possessing Aadhaar card are assisted by the field functionaries to obtain the Aadhaar card.
Till such time they get the Aaadhar card, they are provided the Anganwadi services on the basis of alternative identification document," according to the RTI reply.
Officials said the identification of fake beneficiaries is an ongoing exercise and a report in this regard has been received just from Assam yet.
There are around 14 lakh Anganwadis across the country and 10 crore beneficiaries, which include children under the age of six and pregnant women and lactating mothers.
According to the revised cost norms for supplementary nutrition, children from six to 72 months get Rs 8 per day while severely malnourished children (6-72 months) get Rs 12 per day and pregnant women and nursing mothers get Rs 9.50 per day.
The identification of fake beneficiaries is also being done through smartphones having Integrated Child Development Services-Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) app, officials said.
These smartphones have been distributed to over 1.2 lakh Anganwadi centres.

Reuters
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S.-China trade deal appeared elusive on Friday after Chinese officials unexpectedly canceled a visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska as deputy trade negotiators wrapped up two days of negotiations in Washington. 
Chinese officials were expected to visit U.S. farmers next week as a goodwill gesture, but canceled to return to China sooner than originally scheduled, agriculture organizations from Montana and Nebraska said. 
The United States had removed tariffs overnight from over 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies. 
The Chinese Embassy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office issued a brief statement characterizing the two days as “productive” and that a principal-level trade meeting in Washington would take place in October as previously planned.  
China’s Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described the talks as “constructive”, and said they had also had a good discussion on “detailed arrangements” for the high-level talks in October. 
“Both sides agreed to continue to maintain communication on the relevant issues,” it added, without elaborating. 
Trade experts, executives and government officials in both countries say that even if the September and October talks produced an interim deal, the U.S.-China trade war has hardened into a political and ideological battle that runs far deeper than tariffs and could take years to resolve. 
The Chinese delegation did not present any new proposals on core structural issues including intellectual property protections, forced technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers, said a person briefed on the talks.  
“The conclusion from the U.S. side was that we’re not close to an agreement,” the person said. 
This source and another person familiar with the talks said that the Chinese delegation’s leader, Vice Finance Minister Liao Min, laid out China’s demands that any deal must remove all U.S. tariffs and be balanced so that it is not all concessions from Beijing and none from Washington.  
The sources said that a lack of results from deputy meetings is not uncommon as they often are not authorized to make deals or present new offers. 
The early October meeting will include the top trade negotiators: Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It is expected to determine whether the world’s two largest economies are starting to chart a path out of their 14-month trade war or headed for new and higher tariffs on each others’ goods. 
Cancellation of the Chinese agriculture visits, which were seen as potentially leading to increased purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork, caused Wall Street’s main stock indexes to fall as early optimism about the talks faded.  
Grain and soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade and livestock futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also slumped. China is the world’s largest pork market and the largest importer of soybeans. 
Before the talks started, some reports had suggested that an interim deal was being considered, involving Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods, some improvements in Chinese market access and an easing of U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd 
But U.S. President Donald Trump made clear on Friday that purchases would not be enough for him to end his punitive tariffs.  
“We’re looking for a complete deal. I’m not looking for a partial deal,” he told reporters, adding that he did not need a deal to happen before the 2020 presidential election. 
Speaking at a White House meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Trump touted the billions of dollars in U.S. tariff receipts on Chinese imports, adding that the total would soon reach $100 billion. 
“I will say this: we’re making a lot of progress with China,” the Republican president said. 
The Trump administration and China’s Communist Party remain far apart on issues that are the basis of their trade dispute, including the U.S. declaring some Chinese state companies national security risks, and Beijing’s refusal to revamp its economic model by eliminating subsidies for state companies. 
USTR issued three Federal Register notices on Friday to exclude a wide range of products from tariffs in response to requests from U.S. companies, which argued that the levies would cause economic hardship. 
The 437 exempted products range from printed circuit boards for computer graphics processors to dog collars, laminated wood flooring and miniature Christmas lights. 
The United States is asking that China substantially increase purchases of American soybeans and other farm commodities, a person with knowledge of the planned discussions told Reuters.

Former India opener Gautam Gambhir has urged BCCI to pay a fitting tribute to Yuvraj Singh by retiring number 12 jersey he wore during his international career.
READ: Yuvraj Singh hits Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over
Gambhir, in his column for The Times of India, was reminiscing about September and how it has a special place in his heart as it was during this month India won the inaugural ICC World T20 title under MS Dhoni (September 24, 2007).
Gambhir, who top-scored with 75 off 54 in the final, praised Yuvraj for his performance during the tournament that saw him belt six sixes in an over against England en route to the fastest fifty in T20Is, a record that remains untouched to this date.
READ: Shastri relives magic of Yuvraj’s six sixes in an over
During the showpiece T20I event, Yuvraj scored 148 runs in five innings at a stunning strike-rate of 194.73, playing a stellar role in India’s campaign.
“The month of September, meanwhile, has special emotions for me,” Gambhir wrote in TOI. “It was in this month in 2007 that we won the ICC T20 World Cup. The incredible Yuvraj Singh was in his elements. Just for the performance in that tournament and in the 2011 World Cup, I’d urge BCCI to retire the number 12 jersey that he wore. It will be a fitting tribute to a once-in-a-lifetime cricketer.”
Gambhir himself scored 227 runs including three half-centuries, finishing as the second-highest run-getter during the event. “Overall, our win typified how ‘keeping-it-simple’ works. Perhaps playing the inaugural T20 World Cup worked for us,” Gambhir said.
He added, “We didn’t know what was coming. Hence, rather than worrying about the future we concentrated on the next delivery. I remember asking my dear friend Yuvraj the secret of hitting those six sixes against England. Prince – as I call him fondly – said, “Gauti yaar buss ho gaya (it just happened), I never planned. What Yuvraj is saying is he kept it simple. He batted with a clear mind.”

Times Now
Paris: An innovative boat that will give the passengers an experience of flying on water has been tested in the waters of River Seine in Paris. The "flying taxi", called the "Bubble", is an eco-friendly bubble-shaped taxi.
The electric vehicle, which can fit four passengers, is developed by French startup SeaBubbles. The firm was holding tests on a white, oval-shaped electric hydrofoil boat that looks similar to tiny space shuttles.
The company aims to bring the service that has "no noise, no waves, no pollution" in cities that are congested. By making use of rivers, lakes and other waterways in urban areas, SeaBubbles would help reduce road traffic.

"Think James Bond car, available for everybody, but with zero wave, zero noise, zero CO2 emissions," the startup's website says.
The vehicle was pulled over by the police during the tests. River police interrupted the tests over concerns that the vehicle was going too fast. 
"Our vehicle has the right to go at 30km/h when normally the speed limit on the river is 12km/h. So they just pulled us over to check our paperwork and make sure that all was in order," SeaBubbles co-founder Anders Bringdal said.
If the boat gets approved, it can be ordered on an app just like they book an Uber.
The firm hopes to introduce its services in Paris next year and in cities in Holland and the US.
Bringdal said that there would be about 20-40 vehicles in each city, depending on the operator's choice to use them primarily as water taxis or tourist vehicles.

We continue with the #InsightsPodcast series, and on this edition we have with us Manu Kumar Jain, Managing Director of Xiaomi India, a leader in smartphones, televisions, and many other products.

Manu walks us through the journey of setting up Xiaomi in India and scaling it to become one of the best mobile phone brands in India in a very capital-efficient way.

Revisiting his childhood days, Manu remembers growing up in Meerut in a large family with a business background, where the ultimate aspiration was to set up shop. The larger the shop, the more successful one was.

Unlike most of his cousins, Manu decided to pursue engineering from IIT-Delhi and then did his MBA from IIM-Calcutta, after which he worked with Mckinsey for five years before co-founding Jabong. He ran Jabong for two years before moving out and then joined Xiaomi to start their India business.


After some persuasion from his co-founders, he was able to take the leap of faith, only to get pleasantly surprised that a lot of people were willing to buy shoes and clothes online. Riding on the wave of mobile-first online consumers, Jabong grew from 1,000 orders a day to 10,000 orders a day, to become a top two player in the online fashion space.
Hugely fascinated with mobile as a category and having heard about a Chinese company trying to do things differently by using online as the primary channel for sales, Manu connected with the founders through his network out of pure interest to learn more about the company’s journey. After multiple exchanges between Manu and the founders, sharing learnings with each other on the China and India landscape, Lin Bin, Co-Founder and President of Xiaomi, offered Manu the chance to join them to start their India business.

At a time when India had more than 300 smartphone brands, Xiaomi went ahead with an online-only sales strategy when everyone else was spending huge marketing dollars on advertising and sponsorships. From very early on, the expectation from the board was to be profitable and not burn at a day-to-day operations level.


“We can’t make more than five percent margin from any of our hardware products by board resolution. We believe in a concept called honest price. We cut down all possible costs like marketing, distribution, working capital, and inventory cost, and pass on that benefit to the user, without keeping a profit margin for ourselves.”

The strategy couldn’t have worked better, the phones went out of stock in seconds on launch days, leading ecommerce partner Flipkart’s site to crash. Xiaomi went on to capture almost 50 percent market share in the online channel - that by itself grew from 6 percent to 33 percent of total mobile phone sales in India. By the second year, Xiaomi was able to record billion dollar worth of sales while remaining profitable.
In 2017, Xiaomi made its foray into offline through exclusive Mi stores. The focus on profitability continued as Xiaomi opened stores that were not so large that they hurt the store partner’s profitability; most stores achieved profitability in six months of launch. Today, Xiaomi has 6,000 stores across India and the offline channel contributes to 30 percent of their sales.


On things that worked for Xiaomi, Manu says hiring smart, young and passionate people irrespective of their background helped. “They were never bogged down by what other people or industry experts were saying. They were willing to take risks and do things differently. If you're looking to disrupt and do things differently then you cannot have the traditional industry mindset.”
The culture at Xiaomi is that of encouraging fast decision making, challenging status quo, and giving an equal platform to everyone to voice their opinion. Xiaomi’s journey has not been one without mistakes and that is something they have ingrained into their work culture.


Sharing learnings for young entrepreneurs, Manu talks about the importance of having mentors who do not have a vested interest in your company or you, so that the conversations are brutal and honest.

Last but not the least, Manu stresses on the importance of investing in the team and ensuring that good performers grow within the company, from both and equity and cash perspective. Spending time with the team has always been one of the top three priorities for Manu.


Tune in to the podcast to hear more interesting insights from Manu’s journey of scaling Xiaomi.

ANI
New Delhi [India], Sep 22 (ANI): Security agencies have discovered that Pakistan-based operatives are attempting to use the popularity of the Amitabh Bachchan-anchored show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) to trap individuals and propagate misinformation through fake social media handles."It has been reported by cyber cell, Ministry of Defence that adversaries are taking advantage of the popularity of TV show "Kaun Banega Crorepati" by making individuals join WhatsApp groups and sending fake KBC messages to trap individuals," a security advisory issued by the Defence Ministry said.The advisory listed two Pakistan-based numbers found to be the administrators of WhatsApp groups, which were trying to trap individuals. The Defence Ministry's cyber cell advised people who are part of these groups to "immediately exit such groups if one has already been added."The cyber cell also advised people to configure their WhatsApp settings in a manner that only a person whose contacts details are saved in your phone can add you without an invitation.After the abrogation of article 370, Pakistani spy agencies have become very aggressive in spreading misinformation about India and have been targeting the defence forces in a big way in the virtual world.The security agencies had detected that over 200 fake handles of military officers including both serving and retired officers had come up on social media who were tweeting and spreading messages as per the Pakistani narrative on the Kashmir issue.After the agencies concerned approached Twitter, a large number of such handles were suspended for being fake. The Indian Army has now again asked its personnel to avoid putting up their service or posting details on social media as it can be used by the adversaries to spread misinformation.Also, there have been cases of virtual honey traps where serving officers and jawans have been trapped and forced to leak military classified information to enemy operatives who generally pose as girls on social media.

Reuters
NAIROBI (Reuters) - An Iranian sailor held hostage by Somali pirates was dying of malnutrition, a former British army officer who helped negotiate his release told Reuters on Sunday. Three other Iranian hostages remain in Somalia.  
“This guy was dying – he looked like a skeleton. He was bleeding internally. He had severe malnutrition. I suspect the others are in a similar condition,” John Steed, a retired British colonel, said. Steed has worked in the region for many years trying to free Somali hostages.  
Mohammad Sharif Panahandeh was among 21 crew members of a boat hijacked in March 2015. Eight of the hostages died, five escaped, and Iran freed four last year. 
The hostages had been split up by their captors after arguments over money, said Steed. Panahandeh was released without payment because the pirates thought he would die.  
“He was released last weekend but we  had him in (the northern Somali town of) Galkayo trying to get him fit to travel. A week of trying to get him fit to travel. We had to stabilize him,” Steed said. 
“Nobody wants to pay for these guys because they are Baluchi,” he added. Poverty-stricken Baluchistan straddles the border between Iran and Pakistan and is riven by banditry and insurgency. 
Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Saturday that the United Nations and Steed’s humanitarian group, the Hostage Support Partnership, helped with the release.  
Mousavi also thanked authorities in Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland and in Ethiopia for their help in winning the release of Panahandeh, the state news agency IRNA said.  
Three Iranians sailors are still being held, Mousavi said. 
“We are happy to announce we have obtained the release of one of the last hostages of Somali piracy ... 3 more seafarers remain who need our help,” Hostage Support Partnership tweeted.  
Piracy off Somalia’s coast spiked in 2012 but then sharply subsided, mainly because shipping firms put better security protocols into place, including posting lookouts, sailing further away from Somalia, and hiring private security. International warships operating as part of a coalition also helped drive down the number of attacks.

TechCrunch
As Facebook  prepares to launch its new cryptocurrency Libra in 2020, it’s putting the pieces in place to help it run. In one of the latest developments, it has acquired Servicefriend, a startup that built bots — chat clients for messaging apps based on artificial intelligence — to help customer service teams, TechCrunch has confirmed.
The news was first reported in Israel, where Servicefriend is based, after one of its investors, Roberto Singler, alerted local publication The Marker about the deal. We reached out to Ido Arad, one of the co-founders of the company, who referred our questions to a team at Facebook. Facebook then confirmed the acquisition with an Apple-like non-specific statement:
“We acquire smaller tech companies from time to time. We don’t always discuss our plans,” a Facebook spokesperson said.
Several people, including Arad, his co-founder Shahar Ben Ami, and at least one other indicate that they now work at Facebook within the Calibra digital wallet group on their LinkedIn profiles. Their jobs at the social network started this month, meaning this acquisition closed in recent weeks. (Several others indicate that they are still at Servicefriend, meaning they too may have likely made the move as well.)
Although Facebook isn’t specifying what they will be working on, the most obvious area will be in building a bot — or more likely, a network of bots — for the customer service layer for the Calibra  digital wallet that Facebook is developing.
Facebook’s plan is to build a range of financial services for people to use Calibra to pay out and receive Libra — for example, to send money to contacts, pay bills, top up their phones, buy things and more.
It remains to be seen just how much people will trust Facebook as a provider of all these. So that is where having “human” and accessible customer service experience will be essential.
“We are here for you,” Calibra notes on its welcome page, where it promises 24-7 support in WhatsApp and Messenger for its users.

Servicefriend has worked on Facebook’s platform in the past: specifically it built “hybrid” bots for Messenger for companies to use to complement teams of humans, to better scale their services on messaging platforms. In one Messenger bot that Servicefriend built for Globe Telecom in the Philippines, it noted that the hybrid bot was able to bring the “agent hours” down to under 20 hours for each 1,000 customer interactions.
Bots have been a relatively problematic area for Facebook. The company launched a personal assistant called M in 2015, and then bots that let users talk to businesses in 2016 on Messenger, with quite some fanfare, although the reality was that nothing really worked as well as promised, and in some cases worked significantly worse than whatever services they aimed to replace.
While AI-based assistants such as Alexa have become synonymous with how a computer can carry on a conversation and provide information to humans, the consensus around bots these days is that the most workable way forward is to build services that complement, rather than completely replace, teams.
For Facebook, getting its customer service on Calibra right can help it build and expand its credibility (note: another area where Servicefriend has build services is in using customer service as a marketing channel). Getting it wrong could mean issues not just with customers, but with partners and possibly regulators.

Chennai-based financial technology and digital lending company Hotfoot Technology Solutions has raised $250,000 in a funding round from a group of angel investors.
The funding was aided by the investment banking and advisory firm ANOVA Corporate Services, the company said in a statement.
Hotfoot plans to deploy the funds to strengthen its technology platform and complete its new products for co-lending, collections and data analytics segments.
“As part of our expansion, we will raise the next round of pre-series A funding by July-August of 2020,” said Vivek N, co-founder of Hotfoot Technology Solutions.
The fintech startup works on RAPID, a state-of-the-art loan processing platform. Hotfoot claims the platform uses digitisation, automation, artificial intelligence  (AI) and machine learning (ML) to accelerate time-consuming and manual processes.
The company says its core team has a combined experience of over 75 years in retail lending in India and has been a strategic business partner with banks, non-banking financial services (NBFCs) and manufacturing companies.
Hotfoot Technology Solutions was founded in 2016 by Vivek N and Rajesh Venkatesan. The fintech startup offers a suite of solutions that enable end-to-end digital processing of all types of retail and small and medium enterprises (SME) loans.
The startup claims to offer its services to customers like Adani Capital, Veritas Finance, Muthoot Capital, AU Small Finance Bank and Samunnati Value Chain Finance.
Earlier in the month, Bengaluru-based fintech startup Groww raised $21.4 mn in a Series B funding round, led by Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Ribbit Capital.

Online furniture retailer Pepperfry expects to report its first annual profit in the next financial year and plans to go public in 12-15 months, said its co-founder Ambareesh Murty.
“We plan to file for an initial public offering in the next 12-15 months," Murty, who is also the chief executive of the company, said in an interview on the sidelines of the opening of one of Pepperfry’s largest warehouse in Bengaluru on 20 September.
“The company is on a clear path to full-year profitability by FY21, though we will get very close to being profitable by this October itself," Murty said.
Established in 2012, Pepperfry has raised close to $200 million from investors such as Norwest Venture Partners, Goldman Sachs, State Street Global Advisors, and Bertelsmann India Investments.
The Bengaluru warehouse is among the company’s three large “mother hubs". The other two are in Mumbai and Gurugram. The one in Bengaluru is also the company’s most technologically advanced, though the Mumbai warehouse is the largest in terms of size.
The warehouse, located in Hoskote area in Bengaluru, is spread across 360,000 sq. ft, roughly the size of six football fields. Murty said south India is the largest market for the company with a share of 40%, followed by the west and the north regions with 30% market share each.
“The facility is well placed to cater to the surging demand in south India, thereby resulting in reduced transit times, reduction in long-haul movement costs and decline in return rates," he said.
The warehouse has the capacity to process 1,000 orders a day and a storage capacity of up to 30,000 units, according to Pepperfry. The online furniture retailer receives an average of 3,000 orders per day.
Pepperfry has more than 4.5 million registered users and 58% of its transactions come from repeat buyers.
At present, 60% of the orders comes from mobile devices, with an equal share from the app and mobile web.

Advanced analytics service provider MU Sigma has entered into an out of court settlement with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) and paid $2.5 million in fines for B1 visa fraud. 
In a joint investigation conducted by US ICE, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), it was found that the management consulting firm was circumventing US visa regulations by flying in Indian employees on a B1 visitor visa and misrepresenting the nature of their intended visit to the United States.
Mu Sigma, which has its US headquarter in Chicago, Illinois, operates in conjunction with its main delivery centre in Bangalore. The company was found to be employing B1 visitor visa holders under contract within the U.S. 
Further, the Mu Sigma’s invitation letters for the B1 visa holder employees have falsified information about their nature of the visit to the US. 
It even went to the extremes of instructing potential B1 business visitors and company handlers how to avoid detection by U.S consular and border officials. 
However, the company’s shady tactics did not stop there. 
According to a release by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE),  investigators found out that Mu Sigma’s employees, who were illegally working there were not paid in the US at the standard wage rate their US counterparts get. Instead, the company only paid them in India at a substantially lower India-based wage rate. The company even forced its employees to sign bond contracts that unlawfully sought reimbursement of up to $10,000 of the H-1B visa costs if an employee ceased employment before an agreed-upon date.
The company used this unlawful tactic to inflate their profit margins and to be able to bid super low for contracts against US-based companies.
The investigation was started back in 2013 after a whistleblower, who was a Mu Sigma employee tipped off US ICE that Mu Sigma managers were violating US government’s H-1B visa regulations by illegally employing B1 visitor visa holders under contact.
This company was found to have incurred about 400 potential B1 visa violations and had issued more than 300 illegal visa bond contracts, during the defined period. Special agents also identified that at least 9 Mu Sigma senior executives and managers were actively participating in the wrongdoings. 
On Aug 28, 2019, HSI’s reached a $2.5 million final global settlement with Mu Sigma for allegations of H1B and B1 visa abuse. Of the $2.5 million settlement, $1.6 million will satisfy the civil allegations, and $900,000 will satisfy the criminal allegations. In addition to the monetary compensation, the non-prosecution agreement includes a compliance and monitoring program.

The New Indian Express
LUCKNOW: After losing the plush bungalow allotted to him as former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and then the sprawling Lohia Trust office, Samajwadi Party (SP) patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav is now set to lose his swanky Mercedes SUV.
The Mercedes, according to Estate Department sources, has developed some technical fault and some Rs 26 lakhs is required for the repairs.
"Our budget does not allow us to undertake the expensive repairs so we will give another suitable car, probably a Prado, to Mulayam Singh," said an estate department official.
SP leaders, meanwhile, see this as yet another attempt by the state's BJP government to target the party leaders.
"The government can spend crores of rupees in publicity and advertising but cannot afford a mere Rs 26 lakhs for a car repair. This proves that the BJP is pursuing the politics of vendetta," said an SP leader.
Mulayam Singh and his son Akhilesh Yadav were made to vacate their official bungalows, allotted to them as former Chief Ministers, after a Supreme Court order.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday will release findings of a survey conducted by a Sangh-linked organisation that claims married women are more happy than those in live-in relationships.
The survey was conducted by Pune-based Drishti Stree Adhyayan Prabodhan Kendra (DSAPK) and its findings were discussed at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's coordination meeting in Pushkar earlier this month, sources in the RSS said.
They said as per the survey, married women have a very high level of happiness, whereas the level of happiness was lowest in women in live-in relationships. The findings of the survey will be released after Bhagwat's interaction with the foreign media.
RSS publicity in-charge Arun Kumar in an official statement released on Saturday said Bhagwat's interaction with the foreign media is a routine exercise. This meeting is part of the RSS's continuous process of interacting with people from different walks of life, he said. Bhagwat will brief the international media about the RSS, its views and its functioning, Kumar said.

(Reuters) - Petronet LNG and U.S. liquefied natural gas developer Tellurian Inc signed an initial agreement under which the Indian company and its affiliates will negotiate to buy up to 5 million tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas, the companies said on Saturday. 
Petronet will take an equity investment in Tellurian’s Driftwood project in Louisiana, they said, without providing financial details. The companies said they would try to finalize the deal by March 31, 2020. 
Sources told Reuters on Friday that Petronet would sign a memorandum of understanding with Tellurian to invest $2.5 billion for rights of up to 5 million tonnes a year of LNG over the lifespan of the Driftwood project. 
The announcement comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump are set to meet in Houston this weekend to discuss ways to deepen their energy and trade relations.

Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif go to prove that you can remain friends with your ex. The ex-flames have been good friends long after their relationship ended. The duo has not only been on cordinal terms but has also worked on several movies together, including their last release Bharat. While they have been crystal clear about their relationship in the media, fans have refused to believe that the duo has moved on and are "just friends." Clearing the air about her relationship with Salman, Katrina reinforced that she and Salman are nothing more than friends. 
The actress, who attended the recently held India Today Conclave, spilled the beans on her relationship with her Bharat co-star. The actress revealed that she and Salman share a strong friendship that has lasted for over 16 years. She was all praise for the Dabangg 3 actor as she deemed him as a "true friend" and a "solid person." 
“Its a friendship that's lasted 16 years, he’s a true friend. He's a solid person who is there for you when you need it," she said at the conclave. "He may not be in touch with you all the time but he stands beside his friends," she added. If this doesn't put the link up rumours to rest, we don't know what would. 
While her personal life makes the headlines, Katrina is busy with her upcoming film Sooryavanshi. The actress will be seen reuniting with Akshay Kumar after a decade. As for Salman, he will soon be seen in Dabangg 3 opposite Sonakshi Sinha and newbie Saiee Manjrekar. Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for more updates.

OYO Hotels and Homes founder Ritesh Agarwal’s journey from a college drop out to building a global brand is well known. 

Ritesh, who left his home to startup when he was just 19, always wanted to be an entrepreneur. 


According to him, options for comfortable and standardised travel and stay for the middle-class Indian was limited.

Ritesh Agarwal, with the OYO Team


And in just five years, the Gurugram-based unicorn is the fastest-growing chain of leased and franchised hotels, homes, and living spaces. 

In a short span, Oyo has grown from 300 cities with 10,000+ hotels, 200,000+ rooms to over 500 cities, with over 18,000 hotels and 270,000 rooms in India. It has also acquired several Indian and European startups. 

A global brand, it recently announced that it has reached a new milestone in the US, where it has over 100 hotels in over 21 states and 60 cities. The hospitality startup is backed by the SoftBank Group, Greenoaks Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Lightspeed India.



In its short life, OYO Hotels and Homes has been variously described as a hotel aggregator, an online travel agency (OTA), and even a Ponzi scheme with an unsustainable business model, but never a hotel chain. 

And today, the tables have turned, and it is a different story. Oyo is now valued at $5 billion. 


“In 2015-16, we were locked in a big competitive battle, and there was little bandwidth for us to immediately start on franchising and leasing model because that needs time and effort,” Ritesh recalls. 

The 26-year-old entrepreneur was referring to the days when OYO controlled and managed just a few rooms in a hotel, and not the entire property. While the ubiquitous red-and-white boards outside announced to the world that the buildings were OYO properties, the reality was that it controlled only a few rooms. 

Despite the $1 billion in funding it mopped up in 2018 from Softbank, the journey hasn’t been easy. Growing at breakneck speed, OYO faced just about every challenge that a rapidly scaling startup does - complaints about the quality of properties and services, messed-up reservations, and customer complaints going viral on social media. 


A full-stack franchising and leasing model has given OYO control over the customer experience. But this also means being operationally intensive – hiring, training, monitoring, and retaining service staff. 

“The vision of creating a better living space for the common man remains even today to what it was five years back.”

India.com
As all eyes are on Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s in the United States, too much is literally on the platter.
Indian-origin chef in Houston, Kiran Verma, who runs Kirans’ — an Indian restaurant — in Houston is preparing special meals for PM Narendra Modi, which would be offered at the hotel where PM Modi will be staying to attend the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly.
According to reports, there will be two types of thali — NaMo thali and NaMo mithai. All dishes will be prepared in desi ghee. PM Modi has not made any special request pertaining to his food choice.

The NaMo thali has methi thepla, samosa with mint chutney, kachori with imli chutney, dal and khichdi, khandvi. The entire menu will be revealed later. The mithai thali will have gajar halwa, rasmalai, shrikhand, gulab jamun and kheer.
After Narendra Modi tastes these thalis, both of them will become part of her restaurant’s regular menu.
Chef Kiran, who was born on Odisha, has said that this was the first time she was cooking for PM Modi. She undertook a lot of research on what PM Modi likes, what her mother cooked for him on his birthday.
Preparations for the mega event ‘Howdy, Modi’, are in full swing. The event at the sprawling NRG football stadium will be the largest gathering ever for an elected foreign leader visiting the US, other than the Pope. Reports have claimed that over 50,000 Indian-Americans are expected to attend the event. US President Donald Trump will also take part in the mega function.
Earlier on Saturday, after arriving at the Texas airport, PM Modi tweeted, “Howdy Houston! It’s a bright afternoon here in Houston. Looking forward to a wide range of programmes in this dynamic and energetic city today and tomorrow.”
The PM was received by Director, Trade and International Affairs, Christopher Olson, and other officials.

The New Indian Express
VIJAYAWADA: Alleging sexual harassment against a nursing college correspondent, a girl student lodged a complaint with the Machilipatnam police on Friday. 
According to the Robertson Pet police, the accused S Ramesh (48) was taken into custody based on a complaint lodged by the third-year B.Sc nursing student, alleging that the correspondent of Sara Grace School of Nursing used to threaten all the girl students of awarding less marks in the examinations if they fail to satisfy his sexual desires. He also used to abuse them in the name of caste. 
In her complaint, the 22-year-old student accused the correspondent of misbehaving with students and told police that Ramesh used to take classes in an inebriated condition. Ramesh also threw parties for his friends on the college campus, she pointed out.  “The correspondent made sexual advances towards me and promised me of good grades and placement in a private hospital. When I refused and informed my parents about his behaviour, he developed grudge towards me and threatened me many times,” the victim narrated her ordeal. Students with a poor background and those from lower caste are his soft targets,” the complainant rued. 
She also explained that the correspondent exploited students from Kerala in the past and cases were filed against him in this regard. 
“Ramesh cheated many students promising MBBS seats and collected lakhs of rupees from them in 2006. He was arrested and started the nursing institute after coming out of jail,” she added. A case has been registered under relevant sections of harassment and SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against him.

Times Now
Washington: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's charity is making use of young royal Archie's name to bring someone's ambitious project to life.
The royals donated USD 5,000 in the name of their baby boy Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor in order to provide help for building a swimming pool in Guinjata Bay, Mozambique.
This came to light when the swim coach Adam Knight, who runs a JustGiving.com for almost a month, saw a mystery donor by the name - Archie HMW who donated the money to him.
"I said to my colleague, 'That has to be Harry and Meghan,'" he shared with Harper's Bazaar, cited E! News.
"We made some calls and were able to verify that it was from them, which is just incredible. Without that donation and support this would not be happening," he detailed.
After this huge donation, a swimming pool could be completed by August next year and will provide a safe space for kids to train and learn how to swim.
"Having our own pool means we'll be able to double the number of swimming lessons and also help create paying jobs for the teachers we've trained," Adam shared.
He is not just happy that people can hone their swimming skills but added that "it also provides employment opportunities in an area that thrives on marine eco-tourism and scuba diving trips, but has so many living below the poverty line."

The New Indian Express
MUMBAI: Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray, who is being projected as next deputy chief minister of Maharashtra by some leaders of his party, on Saturday said he was not seeking any post, but would not shirk from "responsibility".
On Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking "loudmouths" to refrain from commenting on the Ram Temple issue while it is before the court, Thackeray said it is the common wish of the Shiv Sena and BJP that the temple is built in Ayodhya.
"I am not running behind any post. I will work to realise the dreams and aspirations of the people," he said.
Asked whether he will be next deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, the Yuva Sena chief said it will be decided by his father, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.
Speaking at the 'India Today Conclave 2019' here, he said the Sena would decide, based on people's sentiments, if he will contest the Assembly polls.
"I will not run away from any responsibility. The important thing for me is that all the candidates of my party win the election," he added.

On the Ram temple issue, Thackeray said he had seen the sentiment of people in Ayodhya, and claimed it was the "common wish" of the Shiv Sena and its ally BJP that the temple is constructed at the place where Lord Ram was born.
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who spoke at the event before Thackeray, had stated that land in Aarey Colony was needed for Mumbai Metro's car shed though it would entail cutting of trees.
Asked about it, Aaditya, who has supported citizens' movement against tree-felling in Aarey, said, "The car shed has to go".
"The issue is not just about alliance, it is not about Aaditya versus CM nor is it Shiv Sena versus BJP. This is just an issue of Mumbai versus environmental damage," he said.
"We also want the metro. It is our dream project too like it is of the CM but the issue is not just about felling trees, but the ecosystem," Thackeray added.

The New Indian Express
LUCKNOW: A special CBI court here has issued summons to former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and BJP leader Kalyan Singh, directing him to appear before it on September 27 in connection with the Babri Masjid demolition case.
The court is conducting the trial of accused persons, including BJP leaders L K Advani, M M Joshi, Uma Bharti and others for allegedly conspiring to demolish the mosque at the disputed Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya.
Taking note of the information given by the members of the Bar association that Singh's term as Rajasthan governor expired in the first week of this month, special judge S K Yadav on Saturday passed the order on a pending application that the CBI had moved on September 9.
After serving a full five-year term as governor, the 87-year-old leader, who was the Uttar Pradesh chief minister when the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992, rejoined the BJP on September 9.

The court had taken up the application and asked the CBI to produce papers that the term of Singh as the governor has expired.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had then sought time to produce the papers, saying it did not receive any documents from its headquarters.
On the information given by the members of bar association, the court issued the summons to Singh for appearing before it on Friday.
Moving the application, the CBI pleaded that Singh was charge-sheeted in 1993.
It further pleaded that the Supreme Court had in April 2017 said Singh could not be brought in as an accused to face trial due to the constitutional immunity granted to governors under Article 361 of the Constitution.
The top court had, however, allowed the CBI to move for the summoning of Singh as an accused as soon as he ceased to be the governor.
All the accused are on bail in the case, the trial of which is being conducted on a day-to-day basis, on the directions of the apex court.

The New Indian Express
BHOPAL: Former Madhya Pradesh minister and Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh has written to his minister son Jaivardhan Singh to immediately stop implementation of previous BJP regime’s decision to build a slaughterhouse near a temple on Bhopal’s outskirts. The veteran politician is currently under attack from opposition BJP and right-wing Hindu groups over his recent “rapes inside temples” controversial remark,
On Saturday, the septuagenarian Congress leader wrote a letter to his MP urban development minister son Jaivardhan Singh, mentioning that the former BJP government’s decision to build a slaughterhouse near a temple on outskirts of Bhopal has hurt the feelings of lakhs of devotees.
In the letter, Singh has mentioned that many pilgrims visit the Kankali Temple during the Navratri. Not only is the temple is close to the Adampur Chhavni, the site of the slaughterhouse, but three more temples, including a Ram Temple and an ISCKON temple are located on the road leading to the Kankali Temple.
During the previous BJP regime, a decision was taken to shift the existing slaughterhouse from Subhash Nagar to Adampur Chhavni (close to the Kankali Temple), which was opposed by the Congress workers at that time. The protests by Congress workers had forced then BJP regime to abandon the idea of building the slaughterhouse in Adampur Chhavni.
But in 2017, the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) mayor and the then Chief Minister, overlooking the concerns of pilgrims and local residents, had gone ahead with the proposal and cleared the detailed project report (DPR) for building the slaughterhouse at Adampur Chhavni.
“I’ve come to know that in pursuance of the previous BJP government’s decision, the BJP-ruled BMC has started the construction of the slaughterhouse, consequently hurting the sentiments of lakhs of devotees and pilgrims who will offer prayers at the Kankali Temple and other nearby temples during the coming Navratri. Lakhs of devotees are hurt by the BJP-ruled BMC to start construction of the slaughterhouse.”
In the letter to his minister’s son, Singh has requested to immediately stop the implementation of the decision of the previous BJP regime by the presently BJP-ruled BMC. Further, Singh requested in the letter to shift the slaughterhouse facility elsewhere.
The Congress politician’s letter to minister son assumed significance, particularly as it came just a few days after his “rapes happening inside temples” remark had triggered huge political controversy nationally, forcing even the national Congress to distance itself from his statements.
On Tuesday, while addressing the Sant Samagam (conclave of Hindu seers) in presence of Chief Minister Kamal Nath in Bhopal, Singh had said “saffron-clad people are selling churan, while some people dressed in saffron robes were committing rapes and the rapes are happening inside temples. Is this our religion? God will not forgive those who have defamed our religion.”
His remarks had possibly come after former BJP MP and a minister of the erstwhile Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Swami Chinmayanand, was accused by a 23-year-old student of sexual assault.
Anti-Digvijaya Singh posters bearing his pictures had come out outside temples in some areas of Bhopal, appealing that Singh’s entry be banned in temples.

The New Indian Express
BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath accused opposition BJP and its senior leaders, including ex-CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan of playing "camera politics," in the name of protesting for the cause of people hit by rain and flood in the state.
Addressing a public event after inaugurating a 220-bed super specialty government hospital in Jabalpur on Saturday, the CM said, "BJP is playing politics just to be in the spotlight in the name of protesting for the state’s flood-hit people."
"If BJP leaders, including Shivraj Singh Chouhan are so concerned about the cause of our farmers and people hit badly by rains and floods, why are they protesting in MP. They should instead go to Delhi and sit on a hunger strike there against their own government for a central relief package for the state. Have they got the guts to demonstrate and resort to hunger strike against their own central government in Delhi?" Nath said.
Meanwhile, in Bhopal, state minister PC Sharma put the blame of hiking VAT on petrol and diesel in the state as well as raising the tax on liquor squarely on the central government. "In the last Union budget, the central government deprived the state of its share of funds worth around Rs 30,000 crore. Also, the central government is yet to release funds for the relief and rehabilitation of our flood-hit people. Where will we get the funds for our flood-hit farmers, if the Centre doesn’t help us?" he said. The state hiked the VAT on both petrol and diesel by 5 per cent. The revised rates came into effect from Friday midnight.

Daily Mail
Tennis bad boy Nick Kyrgios joked he had lost concentration during his Laver Cup defeat to Roger Federer because he had spotted a 'really hot chick in the crowd'.
The controversial 24-year-old was unable to hold off a rousing comeback from the Swiss great in Geneva, eventually being downed 6-7 (5), 7-5, 10-7 after one hour and 51 minutes.
But Kyrgios was found in typically outspoken form again court side, after the Australian star informed his team of the reason behind a patch of poor form.

Having seized the first set in a tiebreak, and then moved a game in front in the second, Kyrgios' remark was caught on camera as he returned to his seat.
He could be heard saying: 'I lost concentration, I saw a really hot chick in the crowd. Like, I'm being genuinely honest — I'd marry her right now. Right now.'
Federer's hard-fought victory moved Team Europe into a 5-3 lead over Team World, and the veteran had also been receiving sound strategic advice from long-standing Tour rival Rafa Nadal from the bench.
But despite the stakes on Saturday being higher, with every match now worth two points, Kyrgios found himself bizarrely distracted by a spectator - much to the bemusement of his support team.

The Australian is often known for his brilliant shotmaking and formidable serve, but is typically embroiled in controversy for behaviour during matches. 
Kyrgios received a code violation for an audible obscenity in the second round of the US Open, and also suffered a tumultuous defeat in the Cincinnati Masters after a flaming row with an umpire - which was promptly followed by a bout of racket smashing.
And after entertaining Federer in the world No 3's home nation, Kyrgios even admitted that he was unsure he would have the support of his own family before the clash. 
When asked whether he believed the stadium would be fully in support of his opponent, he joked: 'Maybe my family - maybe - but again it's going to be an experience I never forget.'

Cricket Country
Omission from T20 International squads for India‘s last two series hasn’t bothered Kuldeep Yadav too much as the chinaman bowler feels it is an opportunity for him to do well in five-day cricket.
Kuldeep was dropped from India’s T20I squads for the West Indies tour and home series against South Africa but that hasn’t dented his confidence.
“So far, I have done a good job in limited-overs format. I feel very comfortable with the white ball,” Kuldeep told reporters in Mysore.
ALSO READ: Virat Kohli justifies Chahal, Kuldeep’s omission from India’s T20I squad
“I am not worried about not being picked for the last two T20I series. Maybe the selectors felt I needed a break. Maybe the team thinks some changes are required. I respect that, and I have no complaints. I see this as an opportunity to do well in Tests.”
Kuldeep was part of the India A side for the second unofficial Test against South Africa A, which ended in a draw in Mysore on Friday.
The wrist spinner had a decent outing in the game, scalping 4 for 121 in 29 overs in the only innings India bowled in the match.
ALSO READ: Aggressive batting approach in T20Is behind Kuldeep and Chahal’s exclusion, feels Aakash Chopra
In 68 T20 matches since that 2016 T20 World Cup, Kuldeep has taken 81 wickets at an average of 22.97 (ninth-best in the world, second among Indians), and an economy rate of 7.60 (fifth among Indians).
And, he feels wrist spinners are in demand currently. “There is no doubt that wrist spinners are dominating the world,” Kuldeep said.
“But sometimes, when you try to stop runs, you actually turn out to be expensive. We need to work on our accuracy. You need to accept that you do get hit for runs and work on being economical.”
Kuldeep, however, feels it is very difficult to adjust to red-ball cricket after consistently featuring in the limited-overs formats.
ALSO READ: Chief selector MSK Prasad explains why Chahal, Kuldeep have not been picked in T20I squad
“It’s hard to play red-ball cricket when you aren’t consistently playing that format,” he said.
“If you aren’t a regular in this format, it takes time to get into your rhythm. When you are consistently playing limited overs and suddenly switch to Tests without much preparation, it will be tough to excel.
“You need to bowl long spells, play practice games, to understand field placements and to know how to pick wickets. It was important for me to come here (in the India A game) and bowl as many overs as possible. There is still plenty of work to do,” Kuldeep added.
He said with Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in fray for Tests, he will have to utilise the limited chances he gets.
“When three spinners like Ashwin, Jaddu and I are in the squad, it’s challenging to pick the right combination. You need to be ready to grab your chance. Of course, there is pressure because you only get a few chances, and you have to make full use of them,” Kuldeep said.

The New Indian Express
SRINAGAR: The National Conference on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statements on "hugging Kashmiris" and "turning Kashmir into a paradise" sound hollow and belie actions taken by his government. "Now we see PM Modi parroting new catch-words.These catch-words are hollow and will eventually vanish into oblivion," the party said in a statement.
Asserting that the party rejects the prime minister's "rants", the NC said people are the best judge of the veracity of Modi's earlier catch-words of "Kashmiriyat, Jhamooriyat and Insaniyat". "The government led by PM Modi has obliterated the very visage of Kashmiriyat by bifurcating the state. The jhamooriyat rant too turned out to be a damp squib following the detention of legitimate political voices of the state," said the NC statement.
"The PM's insaniyat rant too turned out to be a damp squib following the unparalleled clampdown in the state in the shape of communication gags and curfews,"it said. The party said Modi's dream of 'Naya (new) Kashmir' is to "disempower people" of the state.
"By turning the state of Jammu and Kashmir into (two) Union territories, the lieutenant governor, chief minister and other elected functionaries of the Jammu and Kashmir Union territory will be confined far behind in the protocol as compared to when J&K was a state," it said.
The statement said jobs and scholarships which otherwise were only reserved for state subjects would cease to be solely available to the youths of the state. "By removing the safety valve of the state in the shape of Article 370 and Article 35-A, the people of the state, irrespective of their caste, creed and religion have become prone of numerous susceptibilities," said the NC statement.
The party accused the Centre of trying to put the state land on sale ignoring the fact that farmers in a mountainous Jammu and Kashmir have very low land-holdings. "The state is mountainous and as such the land holding of the farmers are very small as compared to the farmers in the rest of the country. Today, we see how the government of India and the local administration is persistent on putting up the land of the state on wanton sale without giving a thought to the plethora of socio-political, ecological and political issues that will pop up following such a move," the party said.
The NC said the path on which the Centre was treading, would eventually lead to socio-political disempowerment of the people of Kashmir. "It will undo what good was achieved by the successive NC-led governments in the state. People of the state have understood the reality and no gimmickry can beguile them. They are the best judges. They are seeing for themselves as to how the government has sucked the life and blood of the people of the state by unilaterally and unconstitutionally scrapping Article 370 and Article 35-A," the NC said.

Just when you think researchers have found the wackiest possible use for a neural net yet, another team finds an even more novel use for artificial intelligence. Take Facebook's new Fashion++ AI. It's a program that will help you become a fashionista.
Facebook trained Fashion++ by showing the AI thousands of images of outfits that were deemed "fashionable." What's innovative about the AI is that it offers suggestions that are subtle. It won't, for example, recommend that you go out of your way to buy an entirely new outfit. Instead, it will suggest swapping one or two items. It may offer even more subtle suggestions such as recommending that you tuck in your shirt or roll up your sleeves. It's also taking on a task that is often considered creative and subjective. The company imagines the AI one day helping fashion designers to create new looks.
As far as weird AI experiments go, Facebook has been on something of a tear recently. Last month, the company published a paper on how it's using Minecraft to train a digital personal assistant that can help with generalist tasks. The way we see it, weird AI is a lot more fun than murderous AI.

Twitter has suspended thousands of accounts linked with state-backed misinformation campaigns. In a transparency report shared today, Twitter says it removed 4,248 accounts from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 273 accounts from the UAE and Egypt, 1,019 accounts based in Ecuador, 265 accounts from Spain and six accounts from Saudi Arabia. It also released more data on 4,301 of the 200,000 accounts from China and Hong Kong that were suspended for stoking unrest around the Hong Kong protests.
This is part of Twitter's ongoing effort to sweep state-backed misinformation accounts from the platform. In June, Twitter removed nearly 4,800 accounts with ties to the Iranian government, and in August it banned nearly 1,000 accounts managed by the Chinese state and aimed at Hong Kong protests. In addition to targeting state-backed misinformation, Twitter recently updated its policy to ban advertising from state-controlled news outlets, even when it isn't misinformation per se.
Transparency is part of our DNA at Twitter. Today, we're updating our archive of state-backed information operations we've removed from our service. Read our latest blog here: https://t.co/YeCLedMGxH
Facebook also removed accounts linked with misinformation in Spain. The accounts removed by both platforms were linked with Spain's People's Party, Partido Popular. As the Financial Times points out, it's one of the few occasions in which social media platforms have linked a major political party in western Europe with coordinated disinformation campaigns.

Reuters
(Reuters) - Wearable device maker Fitbit Inc (FIT.N) has been in talks with an investment bank about the possibility of exploring a sale amid challenges in successfully pivoting from fitness trackers to smart watches, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
Fitbit has held discussions with investment bank Qatalyst Partners about whether it should engage with potential acquirers, the sources said.  
Fitbit has not yet decided whether it will pursue a sale and there is no certainty it will do so, the sources said. Qatalyst has been seeking to persuade Fitbit to explore its options for several weeks, arguing it could attract acquisition interest from Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) as well as private equity firms, one of the sources added. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Fitbit and Alphabet said that it is their policy not to comment on rumours and speculation. Qatalyst did not respond to a request for comment.

New Delhi: Hours after the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced dates for Haryana and Maharashtra Assembly polls, Union Home Minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah took to Twitter to urge the people to bring the BJP to power to these states once again.
Saying that the BJP has taken these two states to new heights in terms of growth and development, Shah also urged his party workers to highlight the achievements of the ruling government in these states.
“I heartily welcome the announcement of Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly polls by the EC. The election is not only the biggest festival of democracy, but it is also the means to keep our country and states on the path of development,” he said in a tweet.

The Financial Express
Launching a stinging attack on Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said the “breaking and making parties” kind of politics practiced by the NCP chief is now catching up with his party with the passage of time. Against the backdrop of a string of defections from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress to the ruling BJP and the Shiv Sena, Fadnavis said Opposition leadership has failed to instill confidence among their leaders. “Opposition leaders are switching to the BJP because they have realised that the country’s future is bright under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said at the ‘India Today Conclave 2019’ event here. Maharashtra will face single-phase elections for all 288 seats on October 21. Counting of votes will be done on October 24.
As elections draw closer, top leadership of the BJP, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah, has amplified their attack on Pawar. In a rally in Nashik on Thursday, Modi slammed Pawar over his statement on Pakistani people. Earlier, Fadnavis had targetted Pawar on the same issue and said the statement was made with an eye on a particular vote bank. Asked about Pawar’s allegations the BJP-led government was issuing notices to sugar barons and pressurising them into joining the ruling camp, Fadnavis said, “Pawar Sahab used to do this and hence he thinks we also will do so. But there is a big difference between theirs and our brand of politics. We need not play the kind of politics Pawar Sahab played”. He added that Pawar once “made and broke parties”. “It was the charisma of time now that the same thing is happening to his party, the NCP, today.
You need not cry foul now. The kind of politics you played, it will resonate and echo somewhere,” the chief minister said. With a string of desertions, the NCP, which was formed in 1999 by Pawar after walking out of the Congress, is facing its worst crisis in the state which it had ruled in allinace with the Congress for three consecutive terms since 2014. The CM said the BJP has inducted leaders/MLAs into his party party fold only after a background check. Leaders from NCP and Congress including Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, Udayanraje Bhosale, Ganesh Naik, Harshvardhan Patil, Shivendrasinh Bhosale, Kalidas Kolambkar, Vaibhav Pichad to name a few, have joined the BJP recently. When asked if he was the “Sharad Pawar of the 21st Century”, Fadnavis said he will rather play his own kind of politics. “The era of Sharad Pawar ji’s politics is over.
The kind of politics he would play of making and breaking (of parties and MLAs) is over now. Such politics won’t work, generations have changed. People don’t accept such politics now,” Fadnavis said. The chief minister said leaders today identify themselves with the kind of politics being played by the BJP. “My government never faced any corruption charges unlike previous dispensations led by the Congress and the NCP,” he said, adding that allegations made against some members of the state Cabinet could not be proved.
Meanwhile, Fadnavis said he would renounce politics if the allegation against him of transferring bank accounts of state police personnel to a private bank, where his wife holds a senior post, are proved. “The transfer of accounts happened in 2005 when the Congress-NCP combine was in power. I got married to Amruta in November 2005. I challenge any leader to prove charges against me…I will renounce politics if the charges are proved. If not, they should quit politics,” he added.

The corporate tax cut announced by the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday, had not only left corporates and stock markets delirious with joy, but also the incubators, across the country.


The Companies Act requires firms with a net worth of Rs 500 crore, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, to set aside two percent of their average net profits over the last three years towards ‘approved’ CSR activities. 

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman

The announcement stated that, the money can be invested on incubators, which are engaged in conducting researches in science, technology, engineering and medicine aimed at promoting Social Development Goals (SDGs).

However, this CSR fund can be spent on incubators funded by the Central or State governments or public- sector undertakings, which includes publicly-funded universities, IITs, national laboratories and other autonomous bodies established by government departments.

The news was a big boost for the incubators across the country, as they can now get their to fund from the private sector. According to reports, there are around 140 incubators and accelerators in the country.

Narayan Mahadevan, Co-founder, BridgeLabz said,




In January 2016, various incubators in India, got a boost from the Government, after the launch of the Startup India programme. Today, various state governments, along with the Centre, are encouraging setting up of incubators.

States like Karnataka, Telangana, and Rajasthan have been in the forefront of setting up of incubators, where government, industry and academic bodies come together to foster innovation and entrepreneurship.

Reuters
(Reuters) - U.S. energy company Exelon Corp EXC.N said it will shut the last reactor at the Three Mile Island power plant, site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, at noon local time on Friday. 
The company announced in May that it planned to shut the 45-year old unit in September due to inaction in the Pennsylvania legislature on a bill that would have subsidized the continued operation of nuclear power in the state. 
Paul Adams, a spokesman for Exelon, said the company will issue a statement later Friday on the planned closure. He noted Exelon never owned the unit that suffered the accident in 1979. 
Exelon said on its website it bought the 837-megawatt (MW) Unit 1 at Three Mile Island about 20 years after accident at Unit 2. Unit 2 is owned by FirstEnergy Corp (FE.N).  
One megawatt can power about 1,000 average U.S. homes.  
Nuclear services company EnergySolutions Inc said in July it was in negotiations with a unit of FirstEnergy to acquire and complete the decommissioning of Unit 2. 
In recent years, electricity prices have been depressed by cheap natural gas from shale fields, including the Marcellus in Pennsylvania, and by increased use of renewable power. 
This has reduced the amount of money power plants can make selling electricity and forced generators to shut several coal and nuclear plants in recent years. 
Many states, including New York, Illinois, Connecticut, New Jersey and Ohio have already adopted nuclear subsidies to keep their reactors in service to help meet carbon reduction and other goals. 
Lawmakers in Pennsylvania have considered legislation, but not in time for Three Mile Island. Exelon said it had to decide whether to spend the money to refuel the plant by June 1. 
In addition to the states, officials in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration have also proposed programs to keep nuclear and coal plants operating longer. 
Nuclear power plants generated about 39% of Pennsylvania’s electricity in 2018 and have provided over 90% of its zero-carbon power, according to federal and industry data. 
Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, Exelon operates two reactors at Peach Bottom and two at Limerick, FirstEnergy operates two reactors at Beaver Valley, and Talen Energy owns two at Susquehanna. 
FirstEnergy’s bankrupt FirstEnergy Solutions unit has said it would shut Beaver Valley in 2021 unless the reactors receive some financial support from federal or state programs.

The New Indian Express
PUNE: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Saturday said Pakistan is the "least qualified" country to criticise India on the Kashmir issue, especially in view of its own record in PoK.
Speaking at the Pune International Literary Festival, the Lok Sabha MP from Kerala also said differences between political parties do not matter when it comes to foreign policy.
"I would like to send an implicit message outside. We may have differences within our country but when it comes to India's interest, it is not BJP's foreign policy nor is it Congress' foreign policy. It is the Indian foreign policy," Tharoor asserted.
He had the right to criticise the (Union) government on Jammu and Kashmir as to the treatment meted out to the people and elected representatives of that state, he said.
"I will continue to attack the government on domestic issues, but when it comes to the international position, I feel Pakistan is the least qualified country to criticise India on Kashmir issue. Look at what they have done to PoK (Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir)," he said.
Talking about his own transition from international diplomat to politician, the Congress leader said earlier he got "preferential treatment", but now the "protective ring" has been removed, adding that he has had many "tests by fire".

He used to interact with "real people" when he first took to social media, but now 95 per cent people on social media are "abusers", he said.
"There is a mafia of abusers on social media and they will do everything to call me a murderer or declare me the reincarnation of Casanova," he said.
Talking about Narendra Modi, Tharoor said he must be given his due as a democratically elected prime minister.
"Whether we like his politics or not, nonetheless he is the democratically elected PM of the country and when he goes abroad, he is PM of India and he carries my flag. I want him to be received and treated with the respect due to my country's prime minister," he said.
By stating thus, he was not only showing respect for the institution of prime minister but also showing respect to the Indian voter, the Congress MP said.

Times Now
New Delhi: While hearing a case concerning an assault which dates back to 2014, a judge in Delhi recently sentenced a man to jail. His crime, gesturing at a woman with his middle finger apart from making obscene facial expressions. The complainant, in this case, also alleged that the accused passed lewd remarks aimed at her and even slapped her.
The matter was first brought to the attention of Delhi Police in May of 2014 by a woman who claimed that her brother-in-law showed her his middle finger apart from passing lewd remarks and physically assaulting her. An investigation into the matter resulted in police booking the accused under sections 509 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which correspond to punishment awarded for word gesture or lewd remarks meant to insult the modesty of a woman.
On the basis of the police investigation, the court framed charges against the man on October 8, 2015. According to a report, the accused entered a plea of not guilty and decided to contest the allegations in a court of law. In the course of the trial, the prosecution examined as many as four witnesses, including the complainant. The woman, in her testimony, levelled the same allegations she had stated in her complaint.
However, the accused consistently denied all of the allegations and termed them entirely baseless. In his defence, he claimed that the woman accused him of outraging her modesty owing to a property dispute between them. He even called his own sister to testify in his favor.
Hearing the case, metropolitan magistrate Vasundhara Azad stated that the actions of the accused amounted to making utterances or gestures intended to outrage the modesty of a woman. She further cited the complainant's medico-legal case (MLC) report. This report showed a "linear bruise" on the woman's body. Furthermore, Azad said that the court did not find any evidence of a property dispute as claimed by the defendant. 
She also said that a conviction, in this case, can be based on the sole testimony of the survivor if the same was "trustworthy", "reliable" and "worthy of credence". Meanwhile, the court rejected the defence witness' testimony since the statements made by her could not be corroborated. The accused is now looking at a maximum punishment of three years in prison along with a fine. However, the quantum of the punishment will be announced on Tuesday.

Washington DC: At least two people were killed, and eight others injured in a shooting at a bar in South Carolina, USA, news agency ANI reported.
It is a breaking story, more details are awaited.
In an earlier incident, nearly 20 people were killed while 24 others injured in a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas. The massacre took place near the Cielo Vista Mall, a few miles from the US-Mexico border. Police said the Walmart was ‘at capacity’ with shoppers buying back-to-school supplies at the time of the attack.

Tehran is ready for “any scenario,” and remains determined to fight back “until the full destruction of any aggressor,” IRGC commander, Major General Hossein Salami, told reporters at a news conference on Saturday.
“Whoever wants their land to become the main battlefield, go ahead,” he said.
Salami made his comments while showcasing the pieces of a US RQ-4 Global Hawk spy drone that was downed by the IRGC over the Strait of Hormuz in June. Iran claimed the drone had violated its airspace, though this was disputed by Washington. Salami vowed to “take action” against all foreign drones violating the nation’s borders.
“If anyone crosses our borders, we will hit them,” he stated.
Tensions between Iran and the US flared up once again last week, after armed drones struck two Saudi oil refineries, temporarily crippling the kingdom’s oil production.
Yemen’s Houthi rebels were quick to admit making the attack. The US and the Saudis, however, blamed Iran, which strongly rejected having been involved in the drone strikes.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated that Washington may increase its ‘maximum pressure’ against Tehran and build an anti-Iranian coalition. Iranian military officials responded by renewing their pledge to fiercely retaliate if attacked.

Reuters
PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Two Pakistani parliamentarians and human rights campaigners were released on bail in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province after four months in detention, their lawyer said on Saturday. 
    The two lawmakers, Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar, along with several activists of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), were arrested after a deadly clash between troops and activists at a security post in northern Pakistan in May. 
    “Both the parliamentarians were released from Haripur jail after midnight,” Tariq Afghan, the lawyer for the two leaders told Reuters. 
    PTM campaigns against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances of Pashtuns and other ethic minorities. 
It emerged last year after the killing of an ethnic Pashtun man by police in the southern city of Karachi, which led to nationwide protests and turned the issue of alleged state violence against Pashtuns into a national debate. 
The military has accused the PTM of being funded by foreign intelligence agencies - a veiled reference to arch-foe India and its Afghan allies - to stoke unrest in Pakistan’s Pashtun lands after the Pakistani army defeated Islamist militants there. 
The PTM denies foreign links. 
On May 26, soldiers at a security post fired on a group of protesters led by PTM leaders and serving parliamentarians Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir, according to PTM representatives, who said 13 of their supporters were killed. 
The army said troops exchanged fire with the protesters when they attacked the checkpoint, and that three of the attackers were killed. 
On his release, Dawar posted a tweet describing the incident as a massacre. 
“In its aftermath, this State piled up even more violations of human rights, decency in its treatment of Ali and myself,” he said in the tweet on Saturday. 
A spokesman for Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government was not available to comment on Dawar’s allegations.

Reuters
CAIRO (Reuters) - Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis will stop aiming missile and drone attacks at Saudi Arabia if a coalition targeting Yemen does the same, a Houthi official said on Friday, nearly a week after the Houthis claimed a strike on Saudi oil facilities. 
The Houthis have insisted they are responsible for a devastating Sept. 14 assault on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities that initially halved the kingdom’s production, but the United States and Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran.  
Tehran, which support the Houthis, has denied any involvement in the attacks.     
Speaking on the group’s Al Masirah TV, head of the Houthi political office Mahdi al-Mashat called for a halt to strikes on both sides and for serious talks among all players involved. 
“I call on all parties from different sides of the war to engage seriously in genuine negotiations that can lead to a comprehensive national reconciliation that does not exclude anyone,” said Mashat. 
The Saudi-led military coalition did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Houthi announcement. 
The Western-backed, Sunni Muslim coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the internationally recognized government in Sanaa in late 2014. 
Mashat said that the Houthis “would not hesitate to launch a period of great pain” if their call for peace was ignored. 
In the speech, Mashat boasted of the group’s rapidly improved military capabilities and said “significant advancement” would be seen in the coming period, particularly in air and missile defense. 
The Houthis said this week they had picked out dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh’s top Arab ally, as possible targets for future attacks.     
The Yemen conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran and has killed tens of thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine.

New Delhi: Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra on Friday came in support of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Twitter against accusations that she did not take the step to reduce corporate tax in time.
Woke up in the US to this news. The best way to start the day. Not only because companies  will pay less tax. But because this isn't just another policy tweak. @nsitharaman fired a shot that will be heard around the world. India has sent an invitation letter to global investors," he said in a tweet.
Replying to a comment on the finance minister not implementing the measures earlier, Mahindra tweeted: "This is unbelievable. Do you always get things right the first time? Do you never have to retrace your steps? Do you not value and desire the humility in leaders to listen & recalculate their route?"
Mahindra commented on a tweet that read: "Didn't she had this wisdom three months back when she presented union budget ? Sir, common log ha8n bewakoof nahin...first you create a problem, allow it to go worse, fudge numbers...become a saviour...what a performance !!!!
Another tweet said: "Our lives cannot  be run on trail (sic) and error method sir." On which, Mahindra replied: "Really? And you get everything right the first time? (By the way you just got the spelling of ‘trial' wrong!) ".

New Delhi: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked the country's largest airline IndiGo to keep about 15-20% of the seats on its Delhi-Istanbul flight empty during days of strong Westerlies.
The advisory from the Indian civil aviation regulator comes after the airline failed to carry luggage of passengers traveling on the route during one of its flights a few days ago.
The directive was given only for flights facing Westerlies, said a DGCA official.
"These flights consume more fuel, so as a safety measure, should carry less load," the official added.
Westerlies are strong winds, which move from the west toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30-60 degrees during winter.
IndiGo, which started its Delhi-Istanbul route earlier this year, operates Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft on the route.
The airline has seat capacity to carry 186 passengers on its A320 planes and about 222 seats on its A321 aircraft.
Following the advisory, the airline will have to keep upto a fifth of its capacity empty only on its flights facing Westerlies. The other option is to halt at a destination mid-way for refueling, which is a more expensive proposition for the no-frill carrier.

Cricket Country
Among the many delighted faces of India’s physically disabled cricket team that gathered at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s (MCA) BKC Academy on Friday to receive awards after winning the inaugural T20 Physical Disability World Cricket Series in England last month, is Wasim Iqbal Khan.
A leg surgery gone wrong in his childhood left him with a lifelong problem in right leg.
The 26-year-old opener from the Gopalpora area of Kashmir’s Anantnag district is the only member in his family to have opted for a career in sports but Wasim, who smashed a match-winning 43-ball 69 in India’s win over Pakistan during the World Series, has no regrets with his decision.
“My father Mohammad Yousuf Khan and uncle used to play cricket, so that inspired me. Both my elder brothers are advocates, but I always wanted to play cricket,” Wasim, who sustained a leg injury when he was just nine, tells CricketCountry after the team was felicitated by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.
Hailing from Kashmir, Wasim recalled how the current situation after scrapping Article 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir has affected cricket in the state. “There are no matches and whatever little tournaments that were taking place too have been shut,” the 26-year-old informed.

“It has affected my game as well, I really struggle hard to practice because there is nobody around. I don’t have much money to spend on my game. I just try and practice with whoever I get to play. I call some boys and ask them to bowl to me. It’s been 8 years now since the local tournaments have been stopped,” he said.
However, as youngsters of his age opt for a different path, the electrical engineering graduate, now pursuing a degree in Arts and who also helps his parents run the family’s apple orchard, is determined to make it big in cricket.
He owes his recent success to local star Parvez Razool, who has played one ODI and a Twenty20 International for India.
“Parvez Rasool bhai and I live in the same district. I have taken plenty of tips from him and he has supported me a lot. Rasikh Salim (who played for Mumbai Indians this year), like my little brother, has also played with me. We live just about 10-12 kms away from each other, so we get to play often,” Wasim, who also plays for the local club Khan Sultans, mentored by Rasool, said.

Wasimm is a bit concerned about his future as a cricketer but believes the latest news about BCCI honouring the disabled players will be a huge boost. “I am doubtful about our future, but today’s acknowledgement by BCCI and the government of India is a step in the right direction, so let’s hope for the best. Nitin Gadkari saab has asked us to keep performing and they will support us, so Inshaallah, I will keep performing,” he said.
He might be passionate about cricket but as far as financial security goes, Wasim hopes to land a government job. “I’ve got a lot of offers from private companies, but if I get a government job, it will be the best. Minister saab has assured us, so the dream is to excel wherever I am,” he said.

TechCrunch
Less than 24 hours after YouTube  announced that it would be changing its creator verification process, CEO Susan Wojcicki admitted that the news hasn’t gone over very well.
“To our creators & users – I’m sorry for the frustration & hurt that we caused with our new approach to verification,” Wojcicki tweeted. “While trying to make improvements, we missed the mark. As I write this, we’re working to address your concerns & we’ll have more updates soon.”
The stated goal of the changes was to make it clear that verification isn’t an endorsement from YouTube, but simply a statement that the creator really is who they claim to be. This distinction became increasingly important as YouTube faced criticism for allowing the spread of hate speech and misinformation, with executives then defending the service as an open platform.
So moving forward, YouTube said it would focus on verifying public figures, famous brands and well-known creators — rather than allowing any account with more than 100,000 subscribers to request verification.
Been doing Youtube for 5 years, I post 2 videos a week, 950,000 subscribers…. YouTube emails me today that my channel has been “unverified” because the verified badge is only for well known channels with a large following  @TeamYouTube literally no one asked for this 
— Sierra Schultzzie (@Schultzzie) September 19, 2019

As a result of the new policy, numerous YouTube creators (including some with millions of subscribers) were notified they would be losing their verified status. Naturally, they went public with their unhappiness. (The news also led to some false alarms, like complaints that popular YouTuber PewDiePie had lost his checkmark, when he had not.)
While it remains to be seen how extensively YouTube will be revising or reversing its plans — and whether creators will be satisfied — this still seems like a clear mea culpa from YouTube leadership.
Update, September 21: YouTube offered more details about its new plans, saying that channels with a verification badge will keep that badge without needing to appeal, and that channels with more than 100,000 subscribers will still be able to apply for verification. Due to all the changes, the new verification badge will now roll out next year.
Here’s the email sent to creators:

Kalaburagi (Karnataka) [India], Sept 21 (ANI): Criticising the Election Commission (EC) senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday said that it fixed the dates for the Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana as per its own "convenience"."They should have given sufficient time. It is unfortunate as they have fixed the date according to their convenience. This is not fair," Kharge told ANI here.His comments came after the EC announced the election dates for the states of Maharashtra and Haryana. The two states will have single-phase election on October 21, and the counting of the votes will take place on October 24.Taking a jibe at the Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Kharge said that there was no development in the state during his tenure."No proper attention was given by the government to the farmers' issue. I hope this time we replace them," he added.Continuing his tirade against Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government, he said, "I hope people do not vote for BJP-Shiv Sena this time. They have always neglected farmers, badly tackled the flood and did not release funds for it," he said. (ANI)

New Delhi [India], Sept 21 (ANI): BJP MP Vijay Goel on Saturday said that in both Haryana and Maharashtra, his party will form the government and that people know it very well. His comments came soon after the Election Commission announced the dates of Assembly elections to be held in both the states. Voting will take place on October 21, while counting of votes will be held on October 24 in both the states.On being asked about the upcoming elections, Goyal told ANI, "In both the states, BJP will win and people know that very well."Goel, who was protesting here against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over the money being spent on taking out advertisements, added that AAP will also not return to power in the national capital. The BJP MP lashed out at Kejriwal and said that his government had not worked during its tenure and is now spending money on advertisements."For the past five years Kejriwal did not work so the only option left for him now is to take out advertisements and resort to fake publicity. He used people's money for advertisement and publicity," the BJP MP alleged. "Everyday we see Kejriwal's photo in these advertisements whether it is related to dengue, Ganesh Chaturthi, Valmiki Jayanti or any other event," he said. He further said that Delhi has become one of the most polluted cities in the country. "There are traffic jams and the huge problem of car parking. The Mohalla clinics are opened in small kiosks. Tourists see all this and say that the capital of the country is in such a bad shape," said Goel."People of Delhi are smart they know that advertisements being taken out by Kejriwal are fake," he added.

Entrackr
The gig economy has been thriving in India. Uber, Ola, Swiggy, Zomato, Rapido, Bounce, Vogo and many others engage over 5 million gig workers altogether. If we include all Internet-based businesses, then the figure may go up to 10 million or even beyond.
Since the number of such workers is going to proliferate, the government has recognised them under draft Code on Social Security, 2019. According to a proposal draft made by labour and employment ministry, gig workers will have insurance (life and disability), health and maternity benefits, old-age protection and several other rights.
The draft includes people working with marketplaces and any other form of digital intermediaries. It essentially means that people working with Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm without being on their payroll will also be entitled to the rights mentioned above.
However, they won’t be entitled to benefits under the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees’ State Insurance schemes.
As per the draft law, gig workers are defined as people who participate in a work arrangement system and earn livelihood via activities outside the traditional relationship between employer and employees. The term can also be referred to as higher-skilled workers like coders or technology professionals working part-time or as freelancers.
In the last few years, the number of these workers has grown. According to human resource consultancy firm Noble House report, close to 70% Indian companies hired gig workers once last year.
While the number of gig workers has been going north, there has been no social security system to take care of them in the country.
If and when the draft code turns into law, the government will further define the role of firms which hire them.
Observers hailed the move but cautioned against overregulation. They raised concern around the implementation of the policy across digital businesses such as taxi aggregators, food apps, and workforce supplier platforms.
Over regulations can burden such companies with extra cost, which will indirectly impact gig workers. Recently, the US had approved a similar law for gig workers, giving them wage benefits and protection.
The development was first reported by Business Standard.

Reuters
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) board of directors must defend at a trial Chief Executive Elon Musk’s multibillion dollar pay package, which a shareholder lawsuit said unjustly enriched the head of the electric vehicle company. 
Tesla estimated the 2018 compensation package was worth $2.6 billion when it received stockholder approval in March 2018, although stock analysts at the time said it could be worth up to $70 billion if the company - which has yet to post an annual profit - grew quickly. 
The compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire Musk, but sets rewards based on Tesla’s market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next decade. 
On Friday, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled against Tesla’s request to dismiss the lawsuit by shareholder Richard Tornetta at an initial phase in the litigation because of the way the board approved the package. 
As a result, the board must now defend against allegations that it breached its fiduciary duty in approving the package, and that the package unfairly enriches Tesla’s CEO. The ruling opens the way for additional discovery into the decision-making process. 
Tornetta had asked that the pay package be rescinded and the board of Tesla be overhauled to better protect investors. 
The ruling turned on Tesla’s compensation committee, which the company conceded was not independent of Musk, according to Slight’s opinion. Had the package been negotiated by truly independent directors and approved by a majority of shareholders who were unaffiliated with Musk, Slights said he would have dismissed the lawsuit.  
“Plaintiff has well pled, however, that the board level review was not divorced from Musk’s influence,” Slights wrote. 
Musk’s compensation package passed shareholder approval with about 73 percent of votes cast, excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal. The vote result indicated some, but not all, big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company, which has struggled to produce its electric vehicles efficiently and profitably.  
At the time, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the compensation, noting that if achieved Musk’s award would surpass anything previously granted to top U.S. executives. 
Under the award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla’s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder. The package does not require Tesla  to hit profitability metrics.  
Musk does not hold a majority of the Tesla’s stock, but in a separate case, Slights determined that Musk’s sway over Tesla made him in effect a controller from a legal standpoint. As a controller, the board is subject to a higher standard of legal oversight for decisions it makes regarding its relationship with Musk. 
The judge did dismiss Tornetta’s claim that the package amounted to a waste of corporate assets.

Jadavpur University violence: Union Minister of State Babul Supriyo on Saturday said that he will not file an FIR against the student who pulled him by his hair at Jadavpur University on Thursday. His announcement comes after the mother, a cancer patient, of the student made an emotional appeal to the minister to not take any action against her son that may ruin his career.
Reacting to her appeal, Supriyo assured the mother that no action will be taken against her son. He said: “Don’t worry Aunt – I won’t do any harm to your son. I want him to learn a lesson from his mistake. I didn’t file an FIR against anyone – I wouldn’t let anyone,” the minister said in a tweet.
On Thursday, Babul Supriyo was heckled and thrashed by a section of students when he had gone to attend an event organized by ABVP at Jadavpur University. Following the incident, multiple videos surfaced in which the students can be seen heckling the minister. In one such video, a student can be seen pulling Supriyo by his hair.

Times Now
The Internet can be a ruthless place sometimes and who knows it better than our B-town celebs. Recently, Sonakshi Sinha became the target of brutal trolling when she failed to answer a Ramayana related question on the popular show Kaun Banega Crorepati, hosted by Amitabh Bachchan. Since the incident, the actress was trending on all social media sites and many users even started using the hashtag #YoSonakshisodumb.
Now, the actress responded to the criticism she has faced with a tweet. She wrote, "Dear jaage hue trolls.I don't even remember the Pythagoras theorem,Merchant of Venice,Periodic Table,Chronology of the Mughal Dynasty,aur kya kya yaad nahi woh bhi yaad nahi. Agar aapke paas koi kaam nahi aur Itna time hai toh please yeh sab pe bhi memes banao na. I love memes "

On the recent episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati, she has accompanied a contestant named Ruma Devi and the two were asked, "According to the Ramayana, Hanuman fetched the Sanjeevani herb for whom?"
The two couldn't answer the question and had to opt for a lifeline. Since then the actress has become a target of social media trolls. 
Check out some of the tweets and memes that arrived on social media post this incident:

The response of the diva suggests that she is not ashamed to admit that she doesn't know it all and it appears that she has indeed taken all jokes in a positive spirit and a pinch of salt.
On the work front, Sonakshi was last seen in Jagan Shakti's film Mission Mangal, which turned out to be one of the most successful films of the year. The film also starred Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Taapsee Pannu, Nithya Menen, Kirti Kulhari, Sharman Joshi and HG Dattatreya. The diva is currently busy with the shoot of Dabangg 3, co-starring Salman Khan.
Stay tuned to know.

https://www.india.com/lifestyle/grow-hair-on-bald-head-with-this-new-wearable-device-read-on-3779460/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
India.com
There is good news for people experiencing hair loss as researchers have developed a wearable device that harnesses energy from the wearer and delivers gentle electric pulses to stimulate dormant hair follicles and regrow hair.
Because the devices are powered by the movement of the wearer, they do not require a bulky battery pack or complicated electronics.
In fact, they are so low-profile that they could be discreetly worn underneath the crown of an everyday baseball cap.
“I think this will be a very practical solution to hair regeneration,” said one of the researchers Xudong Wang, Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.
In side-by-side tests on hairless mice, the devices stimulated hair growth just as effectively as two different compounds found in baldness medicines, said the study published in the journal ACS Nano.
Based on devices that gather energy from a body’s day-to-day motion, the hair growth technology stimulates the skin with gentle, low-frequency electric pulses, which coax dormant follicles to reactivate hair production.
The devices do not cause hair follicles to sprout anew in smooth skin. Instead, they reactivate hair-producing structures that have gone dormant.
That means they could be used as an intervention for people in the early stages of pattern baldness, but they would not bestow cascading tresses to someone who has been as bald as a billiard ball for several years.
Explaining the hair-growth technology, the researchers said that small devices called nanogenerators passively gather energy from day-to-day movements and then transmit low-frequency pulses of electricity to the skin. That gentle electric stimulation causes dormant follicles to “wake up.”
“Electric stimulations can help many different body functions,” Wang said.
“But before our work, there was no really good solution for low-profile devices that provide gentle but effective stimulations,” Wang said.

ANI
Washington D.C. [USA], Sept 20 (ANI): Researchers have found that a few proteins which are more prevalent in older people prevent the fractured bones from healing.Duke Scientists hope this discovery will lead to new treatments to help people heal after injuries or surgeries."When we decreased the protein level, aging was reversed," said senior author Gurpreet Baht, Ph.D. and assistant professor in the Duke Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. "Not only was there more bone and healing happened faster, but it was also structurally more sound."Baht's team confirmed that older people have more Apolipoprotein E, ApoE for short, than younger people, reported the study published in JCI Insight.They wanted to figure out if and how ApoE affects the multi-step process of bone healing.When you break a bone, your body sends signals through the bloodstream to recruit cells to fix it.At last a different kind of cell eats up the cartilage scaffolds and osteoblasts fill those holes with bone."Over time, this cartilage will continue to be resorbed and osteoblasts will continue to deposit new bone," Baht explained. "After a few months of your arm or leg healing, there will be almost no cartilage anymore. And if you were to look at it five years out, there'd be no sign of an injury anymore."That's if the bone healing process works perfectly. But the researchers found that if they added ApoE to a petri dish with skeletal stem cells, fewer cells developed into osteoblasts and the osteoblasts were worse at building bones."We wanted to see if the cell population was more or less capable of becoming osteoblasts," Baht said. "[Normally,] you put these cells down in a petri dish for about a month and the dish becomes so hard that you can't even scratch the surface because they've made two-dimensional bone there. ApoE-treated cells are still able to do this, they just don't do it as much or as well."Next, the researchers created an intervention by injecting a virus which keeps mice from making Apolipoprotein E. Circulating ApoE levels dropped by 75 per cent and the healed bones contained one and a half-times more strong, hard bone tissue than bones of untreated mice.The research was supported by the Duke Centre for the Study of Aging and Human Development and Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Centre, the Pathway to Stop Diabetes Initiator Award from the American Diabetes Association and a Borden Scholar Award. (ANI)

Times Now
Mumbai: Pakistan always underestimated India's national leadership and they did the same during the Balakot air strikes, IAF Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa said here on Friday.
The IAF chief, who retires later this month, was speaking at an event.
"You must remember that Pakistan has always underestimated our national leadership. Always. In the 1965 war, they underestimated Lal Bahadur Shastri. They never expected him to open up the front and go to Lahore," he said.
"And then they were surprised. They had thought that he will be only fighting in Kashmir... They were surprised. In the Kargil conflict, they were again surprised. They never expected us to pull all our forces and get our Bofors guns and get the Air Force into it and take them out," the IAF chief said.
"So they have always miscalculated. Even now, after Pulwama (terror attack) happened, I think they had miscalculated, thinking that our political leadership will not permit such a (Balakot-like) strike. It is not that our Air Force is not capable. They (Pakistan) know what our capability is. But they were always under the impression that our leadership will not (act)," he said.
In February this year, India carried out air strikes across the LoC and destroyed terror camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province inside Pakistan.
The strikes involving several fighter jets destroyed camps belonging to Pakistan-based terror outfits in Balakot.
Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa, PVSM, AVSM, YSM, VM, ADC is the 25th IAF chief and assumed the post in December 2016 after Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha retired.
Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa will be succeeded by Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria, who was named as the next IAF chief recently

Muzaffarnagar: A teacher, who has been on a sit-in protest here for more than 23 years over alleged land grabbing by a former legislator, has been booked for hanging his undergarments outside the Collectorate office, police said on Saturday.
A case under Section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC was registered against teacher Vijay Singh following a complaint by Nazarat in-charge of the Collectorate Sanjay Kumar, Station House Officer Sameypal Atri said.
Singh has reportedly shifted his dharna site after the authorities asked him to call off his protest and move away from the Collectorate premises.
He had started the sit-in protest at the site on February 26, 1996, against the alleged land grabbing by the former legislator.

Times Now
New Delhi: Cab drivers in the national capital are now carrying condoms in the first-aid boxes of their vehicles. The drivers believe that it is mandatory for them to carry bandages, antiseptic liquid, emergency medicines and a box of condoms in their cars. 
The new list of challans for traffic violations has left the vehicle owners in stress across the country. While a lot of people are stressed with over speeding and not wearing helmets, Ola and Uber drivers in Delhi are stressed over carrying condoms. 
The cab drivers operating in the Delhi-NCR region have become cautious to ensure that a challan is not issued to them for not carrying condoms. Kamaljeet Gill, president of the Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi said, "It is compulsory for all public service vehicles to carry three condoms at all times, which is kept inside the first aid box. "
While one might assume that the condoms are for 'protection', they are mainly for medical emergencies that the drivers might encounter. Gill said that the cab drivers have been instructed to keep the condoms as they can be used on a passenger who has suffered a cut or has broken a bone. 
Kamaljeet Gill said, "In case a person starts bleeding, the condom can be used to stop it. Similarly, if someone has a fracture, a condom can be tied around the area until he reaches a hospital. There are non-medical benefits of condoms as well. It can hold up to three litres of liquid. "
The cab drivers, however, are still confused about the importance of carrying condoms in their cars. They are unaware of the rule that makes it compulsory for them to carry condoms. Ramesh Pal, a cab driver working in Delhi said that he started keeping condoms in his first-aid box after other cab drivers told him to. 
He said that while he has never been asked by a traffic cop to produce a condom, he has been questioned about the same at the annual fitness test at the transport authority's office. The traffic police officials denied asking any of the drivers if they were carrying condoms while checking their vehicles. 
A traffic police official said, "No driver is asked if he's carrying condoms during fitness tests at our vehicle checking centre. However, NGO workers reach out to drivers outside the centre to educate them about safe sex. It is possible that drivers have developed the habit of keeping condoms from there. "
The Delhi Motor Vehicle Rules (1993) does not mandate the carrying of condoms in the vehicle. It says that all taxis should carry a first aid box with sterilized finger dressing, body dressing, hand or foot dressing, two large and three small burn dressings, two 15 grams packets of cotton, a bottle of tincture iodine, sal volatile, one empty bottle fitted with dropper for the eyes and one medicine glass. The Central Motor Vehicles Act, 1989 does not mandate keeping condoms in the first-aid box of vehicles.

Reuters
RACHEL, Nev. (Reuters) - UFO enthusiasts drawn by alien-themed festivities poured into rural Nevada on Friday near the Area 51 U.S. military base, but fears of a mass raid on the remote site or a public safety crisis proved unfounded, with only five people arrested. 
More than 3,000 out-of-towners ventured on Thursday and Friday to the desert region around Area 51, a secretive U.S. Air Force installation long rumored to house government secrets about extraterrestrial life and spaceships. 
The pilgrimage and two festivals welcoming the visitors were organized after a Facebook user jokingly exhorted readers to “storm” Area 51 on Sept. 20 “to see them aliens.” The date chosen for the gathering was never explained.      
Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said the region’s guests were largely well behaved, with just a few exceptions. “I don’t want to jinx myself, but so far it’s gone pretty well,” he said on Friday afternoon. 
Three people were arrested on suspicion of trespassing onto the grounds of Area 51, Lee said. Another was arrested for indecent exposure after urinating near an entrance to the base, and a fifth for an alcohol-related incident, Lee said. 
A steady stream of cars continued rolling into the county on Friday for events that were scheduled to run through the weekend. 
The arrests were reported after a group of about 150 UFO fans and curiosity-seekers gathered outside the heavily guarded entrance to Area 51 around 3 a.m. on Friday, the date and time set by the social-media invitation that went viral. 
One man wore an orange space suit and some sported tin foil hats and alien masks. A sign among the gathering read “Free E.T. from the government.” 
“A bunch of random people in weird costumes standing outside of a government base, why would you want to miss that?” said a YouTube personality who goes by the name Atozy. “That’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.” 
One young woman ducked under a protective gate and was momentarily detained by authorities and released. Most showed no interest in crossing the barrier, according to law enforcement officials keeping watch over the crowd. 
“They’re just here to see what’s going on,” said Sergeant Orlando Guerra of the Nevada Department of Public Safety Investigation Division. “They’re here to have fun.” 
The Air Force had issued a stern warning to the public not to trespass on the installation, which it said is used to test aircraft and train personnel. 
Area 51 had long been shrouded in mystery, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of its alien crew from a supposed unidentified flying object crash in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The U.S. government did not confirm the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes.  
The documents, however, did not end suspicion about space aliens there. 
Area 51 sits about 12 miles (19 km) from the tiny town of Rachel, a community of about 50 year-round residents north of Las Vegas that hosted a music festival to entertain those traveling to the region.  
Some residents had urged the public to stay away for fear the town would be overwhelmed with unruly tourists.   
As of early Friday, about 3,000 people had pitched camp in town, most of them outside the Little A’Le’Inn, an alien-themed motel and restaurant that is Rachel’s only business. Another 250 attended a separate event 40 miles away in Hiko that featured musicians and ufologists. 
Ed Callahan, 49, who drove from Victorville, California, to Rachel, described the atmosphere as “just chill.”  
“It’s not this big, wild thing,” said Callahan, who sported a cowboy hat covered in tin foil and silver tentacles. “When they said 40,000 people, I didn’t want it to be that. If a few more people show up, it’d be all right.” 
Connie West, the Little A’Le’Inn co-owner who scrambled over three months to mobilize for an influx of alien fans, said she was gratified that chaos failed to ensue. 
“I’m relieved the naysayers were proven wrong,” she said.

The Quint
Expressing concern over China's growing military might, US President Donald Trump has said the Communist nation is a threat to the world and blamed his predecessors for not stopping it from stealing America's intellectual property to bolster its defence capabilities.
China has hiked its military spending by seven per cent to USD 152 billion as Beijing aims at countering America's push into the disputed South China Sea.
"Obviously China is a threat to the world in a sense because they are building a military faster than anybody and frankly they are using US money," Trump, who was accompanied by visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, told reporters here on Friday.
Trump said the US Presidents before him allowed China to take out USD 500 billion a year and more than that.
"They have allowed China to steal our intellectual property and property rights and I'm not doing that," he said.
According to the president, the two countries were very close to having a trade deal.
"We work very closely, had intellectual property, all of the tough things work negotiated and then at the last moment, they said we cannot agree to this," he alleged, referring to the abrupt collapse of the trade deal with China early this year.
"I said that's all right we are charging you 25 per cent tariffs and then it's going up and it will continue to go up. Frankly we are making so many hundreds of the numbers that we are taking in to our treasury...Look at the great reports that came out two days ago on retailing, on consumers, on numbers that nobody believes," he added.
The world's two largest economies are locked in a trade war since Trump in March last year imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 per cent on USD 250 billion of Chinese goods. In response, China, the world's second largest economy after the US, imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on USD 110 billion of American goods.
The two countries have resumed their trade negotiations.
Trump has said that he will enter into a trade deal with Beijing only if he is confident that it is good for the US.
"We are taking hundreds of millions potentially over a short period of time, hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of money is coming in from China that never came in before so China wants to make a deal, I think we want to make a deal," Trump said.
"We will see what happens, but I view China in many different ways, but right now I am thinking about trade. But you know trade equals military because if we allow China to take USD 500 billion out of the hide of the United States that money goes into military and other things," said the US president.
Responding to a question from reporters, the visiting Australian prime minister appeared to have a different view on China.
"We have a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. We work well with China. But as we've spoken many times, we need to ensure that as countries develop and realise their potential, they come onto a whole new level, and that means there can be special rules around that," Morrison said.
"We have a great relationship with China. China's growth has been great for Australia, but we need to make sure that we all compete on the same playing field. This is something that the United States and Australia have been very consistent on, that we need to move into this new world where economies are changing," he said.
"China is a big economy, not as big as the United States, but it's a big economy, and that means we've all got to get on the same page with how the rules work. That's what we're working to achieve," Morrison said.
Trump said the US was making a lot of progress with China.
"They're having a bad year. Worst year in 57 years. Their tariffs aren't coming into us. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs. They are devaluing their currency, which means the tariffs are not costing us probably anything, but certainly not very much. They're also adding a lot of money into their economy. They're pouring money into their economy, but were taking in many billions of dollars," he said.
"At some point in the not-too-distant future, it'll be over USD 100 billion. We've never taken in 100 cents from China. It was always the other way around. With that, they lost over 3 million jobs there. Supply chain is crashing, and they have a lot of problems. And want to make a deal. So, we'll see what happens," Trump said.

Reuters
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States and El Salvador on Friday agreed to attempt to reduce the flow of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border by strengthening El Salvador’s capacity to provide for asylum seekers, but did not detail any concrete actions. 
“The core of this is recognising El Salvador’s development of their own asylum system and committing to help them build that capacity,” Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told reporters in Washington after signing documents with El Salvador’s minister of foreign affairs, Alexandra Hill. 
“Individuals crossing through El Salvador should be able to seek protections” in the Central American country even if they were intending to apply for asylum in the United States, he added. 
Neither official said when the arrangement would take effect or provide details on how it would be administered. It was unclear how such a deal would work, given that most migrants from other countries take routes that avoid crossing the small, poverty-stricken El Salvador.         
“We are going to work out operational details. This is just a broad agreement,” Hill told Reuters upon leaving the signing ceremony. 
The agreement represents the latest effort by McAleenan to seal immigration deals with the Northern Triangle countries of Central America - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - from where many immigrants arriving at the U.S. southern border set out. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a centrepiece of his administration and is pushing to staunch the flow of migrants - many of them families - crossing into the United States. Border crossings reached record highs earlier this year, frustrating Trump.  
Guatemala has signed a so-called ‘safe third country’ deal with the United States that requires asylum seekers who travel through Guatemala on the way to the U.S.-Mexico border to ask for refuge in Guatemala first, instead of in the United States. The Guatemalan Congress, however, has not ratified the deal.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The Maldives are not “mired in a Chinese debt trap”, the Chinese government’s top diplomat told the visiting Maldivian foreign minister, amid fears in the Indian Ocean country of debts as high as $3 billion owing to Beijing. 
The Indian Ocean island chain has been caught in a battle for influence between India and China, which invested millions of dollars during the rule of the pro-China former leader Abdulla Yameen as part of China’s Belt and Road plan, designed to improve its global trade reach. 
The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party, which won a landslide in the archipelago’s parliamentary election in April, fears the debts to China could run as high as $3 billion and risk sinking the economy. 
Meeting Maldivian Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid in Beijing, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi said China’s cooperation with the Maldives would not be affected by the change of government, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Friday. 
“China’s cooperation with the Maldives aims to promote the well-being of the Maldivian people, without political intentions and without seeking geopolitical interests,” the ministry cited Wang as saying.  
China provides what help it can to the Maldives without attaching political preconditions, and does not interfere in the its internal affairs, Wang added. 
“It is totally without basis to say that ‘the Maldives is mired in a Chinese debt trap’,” he said. 
The Chinese statement quoted Shahid as saying no country in the world had been as generous to helping the Maldives, pointing to the building of infrastructure and “provision of a large amount of aid and loans”. 
“In this regard, there is absolutely no so-called ‘debt trap’. To say that is complete nonsense.” 
China has been stung by criticism, mostly from Western countries, that it loads up poor, developing nations with unsustainable debt they have no hope of paying back, and that it is seeking to use this to leverage political influence. 
China says its loans are much welcomed and much needed, and points out that it provides them with no political pre-conditions and gives funds to places that Western donors ignore.

The New Indian Express
MUMBAI: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said the BJP and the Shiv Sena will contest the next month's Assembly polls together.
The CM also exuded confidence that he will retain the post after elections.
He dismissed media reports that the BJP will contest 162 out of total 288 seats and the Sena 126.
Fadnavis' remarks come a day after Sena president Uddhav Thackeray asserted that both the parties will contest the elections in alliance, and that an announcement on the seat sharing formula will be made in a couple of days.
Maharashtra will go for a single-phase election on October 21. Counting of votes will be taken up on October 24.
"I am saying with no uncertainty that we will contest the Assembly polls along with Shiv Sena.
The seat-sharing talks are still on, do not trust the reports," Fadnavis said while speaking at the "India Today Conclave 2019" being held here.
Referring to the Sena pitching for equal sharing of the 288 seats, the chief minister said all details about the seat-sharing arrangements will be formally announced at a press briefing.
To a question, Fadnavis said the BJP did not dictate terms to the Sena and that decisions between them are taken "amicably".
On the Sena's criticism of his government through party mouthpiece "Saamana", Fadnavis quipped, "I don't read Saamana".
He said all the decisions taken by his Cabinet were "unanimous" with the support of Shiv Sena ministers.
"No Shiv Sena minister had second thought about any of the decisions in the last five years (since BJP-led government came to power). So, we are not concerned about what happens outside," he said in an oblique reference to 'Saamana'.
Responding to a query on whether he will get another term as the chief minister, the CM retorted: "Do you have any doubt"? He also said the decision to appoint Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray as deputy chief minister, in the event of the NDA government returning to power, will be taken by the Sena.
Fadnavis said he looked at "positively" Aaditya becoming active in politics.
"He is fanning out parts of the state, trying to understand issues pertaining to Maharashtra. I welcome his decision to join active politics, I take it positively. He has to lead Shiv Sena one day. He is going through the process," Fadnavis said.
The chief minister further said people believe the BJP will retain power, and added he will work in Mumbai.
Questioned about the talks of him joining the national politics, Fadnavis said the BJP decides task for him.
The BJP and the Sena had contested the 2014 Assembly polls independently. The BJP had emerged as the single largest party winning 122 seats while the Sena pocketed 63 seats.
Later, both the parties came together to form the government.

New Delhi: Over 500 farmers from different districts of Uttar Pradesh, who started a march to Kishan Ghat in Delhi on Saturday, said the government has agreed to five of their 15 demands. Puran Singh, President of Bhartiya Kisan Sangathan, said the agitation has not been called off and they will meet PM Narendra Modi after 10 days for the remaining demands.
“Government has agreed to five of the fifteen demands. The agitation has not been called off, it is just a temporary arrangement. We will meet PM Modi after 10 days for the remaining demands,” Bhartiya Kisan Sangathan chief Puran Singh told ANI.

He said that the agitation will be completely called off if the government agrees to all of their demands. “If they (govt) agree to all of our demands we will call off the agitation and if not, we will start an agitation from Saharanpur again,” he added.

Earlier in the day, he had said that 11 representatives from the union had gone to the Ministry of Agriculture. “If our demands are accepted, then we will return from here (Delhi-UP border) else we will march to Delhi,” he had said.
On Saturday morning, over 500 farmers from various parts of Uttar Pradesh started their march from Sector 69, Noida, towards Kisan Ghat in New Delhi, over a number of demands such as payment of sugarcane crop dues, full loan waiver and making electricity free for farming amongst others.
Heavy security, including paramilitary forces, was deployed on the route of the march for security reasons. Farmers were of the opinion to hold a hunger strike if their demands are not met even after their march to Delhi.
Notably, the farmers began their march on September 11 to raise a number of issues, including the increase in electricity tariff. They have been camping at Transport Nagar in Sector 69 of Noida since Thursday.

Agra (Uttar Pradesh) [India], Sept 21 (ANI): After opening the first-ever baby feeding room in Taj Mahal, the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) has now opened another baby feeding room in the Red Fort here.The baby room was inaugurated by Agra MP SP Singh Baghel and his wife Madhu Baghel here on Thursday."Supreme Court had prohibited any new construction in these historical monuments, so these rooms have been made in the existing spaces. The room is fully air-conditioned and designed keeping in mind the safety of the mother-child duo," SP Singh Baghel, MP Agra, told ANI. "A lot of people appreciated when we installed a baby feeding room in Taj Mahal. We have provided two rooms which can accommodate at least 5 women at a time. In order to avoid any kind of injuries, the room has rubber flooring and furniture without any sharp edges," said Basant Kumar Swarkar, Superintendenting Archeology of ASI."This is a very good initiative. We used to face a lot of difficulties while feeding the baby but now these rooms will provide comfort to us," said Neha Maheswari, a tourist."I appreciate the authorities for providing such rooms in public places. This will ensure the privacy and safety of the mother while feeding her child," said another tourist Megha Aggarwal. (ANI)

The New Indian Express
AHMEDNAGAR (Maharashtra): NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the latter's swipe about Pawar `liking' Pakistan, and said it did not behove a PM to speak before verifying the facts.
Addressing a rally in Nashik on Thursday, ahead of Maharashtra elections, Modi alleged that Congress leaders' comments were being used by `other countries' against India.
"I can understand the confusion of the Congress. But Sharad Pawar? I feel bad when an experienced leader like him makes wrong statements for votes. He said he likes the neighbouring country. But everyone knows where the terror factory is," Modi had said.
Countering him, Pawar said in Ahmednagar in central Maharashtra on Saturday that the ruling establishment and the army in Pakistan have a policy of badmouthing India.
"This policy is not in the interest of common people in Pakistan, but it serves the interests of the rulers in that country. I said this. Did this help Pakistan in any way? Should a prime minister speak in this way?" Pawar asked.

Times Now
It goes without saying that television show Kaun Banega Crorepati is one of India's most loved quiz show. Hosted by Amitabh Bachchan, the show has been entertaining the audience for 10 years now and the show is currently in its eleventh season. With its tricky and intriguing questions, the show continues to tickle the curiosity of many. The Friday episode of the show welcomed Ruma Devi, who is the president of the Gramin Vikas Evam Chetna Sansthan and has empowered over 22,000 women across 75 villages in Barmer making them financially independent. 
To support her on the quiz reality show, Bollywood actress Sonakshi Sinha graced the hot seat and tried helping Ruma Devi with several questions that were asked by Big B. While Ruma and Sonakshi together managed to win a total of Rs. 12 lakh 50 thousand, one specific question that the two were asked has grabbed everyone's attention.
The question that was asked to Ruma Devi was, "According to the Ramayana, Hanuman fetched the Sanjeevani herb for whom?" While Ruma did not know the answer to the question, Sonakshi was confused thinking that Sita might be the correct answer. The two, however, decided to use a lifeline and it was the expert advisor who informed Sonakshi and Ruma that Lakshmana was the right answer. 
Soon after the two were informed about the right answer, Big B trolled the Dabangg actress for not knowing the answer since the names of almost all her family members have a connection to Ramayana. While her uncles and father go by the names Ram, Lakshmana, Bharat and Shatrughan Sinha, the actress' brothers are named Luv and Kush. Amitabh Bachchan also jokingly told Poonam Sinha that she shouldn't let her husband watch this episode. Adding to this, Sonakshi joked that the gates of her house 'Ramayana' will be shut for her after this episode.
 
 
Meanwhile, Ruma Devi's NGO is known for providing logistical support to several women artisans in rural areas. She provides employment in embroidery, patchwork and mirror work. Although her parents were initially not happy with her decision to work, Ruma fought her way through various obstacles and continued to work. Over the years, Ruma has participated in many fashion events and has also worked with famous designers like Bibi Russel, Abraham and Thakore, Hemant Trivedi, Anita Dongre and Rohit Kumar.
In 2018, Ruma was honoured with Nari Shakti Puraskar, for her exceptional work and contribution towards women empowerment. 
Stay tuned for further updates.

The Financial Express
Sharad Pawar Pulwama statement: In what could invite intense backlash, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar has said that people of Maharashtra are angry with the BJP-Shiv Sena government and that only a Pulwama-like terror attack can change the sentiments. Speaking to reporters during a press conference in Aurangabad after attending a meeting of party workers, Pawar said there was resentment against the Modi government before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections too, however, the Pulwama attack changed the situation.
A suicide attacker had rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into one of the buses carrying Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men on February 14 on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway in Pulwama killing 40 security personnel. The audacious attack led Indian forces launching airstrikes in Balakot, Pakistan.

“There was anger against the Narendra Modi government before 2019 Lok Sabha polls. But Pulwama attack changed the entire situation,” Pawar said, adding that he was witnessing similar anger against the Devendra Fadnavis government in the state. “Only another Pulwama attack-like situation can changepeople’s mind,” he said.
Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, both ruled by the BJP, are due in October and November. The Election Commission is likely to announce the poll dates soon.
Talking about prospects of an alliance of Opposition parties to take on the BJP-Shiv Sena combine, Sharad Pawar said Samajwadi Party and other smaller parties are already in support of the Congress-NCP alliance. He said the NCP was ready to join hands with Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), however, the Congress raised an objection to it.
The 78-year-old leader also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ‘misuse’ of central agencies like the CBI and ED. During Modi government’s tenure people learnt about (existence of) agencies like ED and CBI. I have worked with many prime ministers, but such misuse (of agencies) wasnot seen earlier,” news agency PTI quoted Sharad Pawar, as saying.

TechCircle
Chinese ecommerce platform ClubFactory is in the crosshairs of the Delhi commissioner of customs over non-compliance with Customs Act 1962.
Goods imported by the company were confiscated by the office of the commissioner of customs (air cargo export) as they were found to be mis-declared as business to business (B2B) shipment while the department found it to be business to consumer (B2C) shipment, according to the preliminary investigations.
Documents reviewed by TechCircle show that Globemax Commerce India, a fully owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-registered holding company of ClubFactory A2Z Trade, has been asked to submit documentation to further the investigation.
Globemax Commerce India has been asked to submit its balance sheets, auditor reports and sale and purchase ledgers dating back to five years as well as the copy of the agreement with its foreign supplier.
If found to be non-compliant under the Customs Act, ClubFactory will be required to deposit the due amount as part of customs duty as well as penalty or, in extreme cases, might lead to criminal proceedings.
“If the documents filed by the company were falsified, the customs officials can ask the company to pay a penalty of up to five times the value of goods under the provisions of Section 114 AA of Customs Act. Key employees and directors of the company can also be criminally prosecuted in extreme cases,” said Sandeep Chilana, managing partner at Chilana  & Chilana Law Offices and an expert in commercial and tax litigation.
“Club Factory is witnessing very healthy growth in India and is growing consistently. With our strategy to charge zero commission fee form sellers, we are helping the ecommerce industry grow by empowering local sellers and benefiting consumers by offering the best possible price. Our business in India complies with local regulations and we have strict measures in place to take action against sellers who might violate any local policy,” ClubFactory said in a statement in response to specific email queries.
It will not be the first time ClubFactory has had to face the heat for evading customs duty. Earlier, the Mumbai port had clamped down on the misuse of gift channel by cross border ecommerce players, leading to the temporary suspension of services by SheIn and ClubFactory.
The provision of gift channel exempts gifts to friends and family sent by Non-Resident Indians up to a value of Rs 5,000 from taxation.
“There are two routes of commercial imports - either through an Indian intermediary who clears the goods from customs and pays the required duties or getting the customs clearance done by the courier partner who delivers the goods directly to the end customer,” said Chilana.
Multiple cross-border players were found to be misusing the provision for shipping goods from sellers outside of India to customers in the country. In July, citizen engagement platform LocalCircles had written to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes to fix a flat rate of customs and GST at 42.05%.

Entrackr
After months of negotiation and talks, Tencent has finally invested PolicyBazaar. The Chinese tech behemoth has closed about $130-150 million round in Etechaces Marketing and Consulting, which owns PolicyBazaar, PaisaBazaar, according to two sources familiar with the details of the transaction.
“The deal was completed three-four weeks ago at a valuation of $1.5 billion,” said sources on condition of anonymity. The duo took over three months in finalizing the contours of the deal.
While sources emphasized that Tencent has acquired primary stakes in the Gurugram-based company, Entrackr couldn’t verify independently about the nature of equity (primary or secondary) acquisition by WeChat’s owner. A TOI report in July mentioned that Tencent would acquire fresh shares in Etechaces Marketing and Consulting.
“Tencent has at least invested $130 million in PolicyBazaar. The deal size may have gone up to $150 million as well. Post investment, it will acquire anywhere between 7 to 10% equity in the firm,” revealed sources. All sources, including a company insider, requested anonymity as they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.
This is the third investment for Tencent this year. It’s also backing small business focused bookkeeping app KhataBook. Entrackr had exclusively reported about its investment early this month. So far, Tencent invested in eight firms, including five Unicorns – BYJU’s, Dream11, Hike, Swiggy, and Ola. 
It also had put money in Practo, Flipkart (now exited) and OTA – ibibo (now part of MMT) and TIL-hatched music streaming app Gaana. According to media reports, it’s also in talks to invest in ShareChat.
Responding to Entrackr‘s query PolicyBazaar, CEO, Yashish Dahiya denied of any such development taking place. Questions sent to Tencent didn’t elicit any immediate response. We will update the post as and when it responds.
Chinese investors, including Tencent, have been ramping up its stake in fintech space in India. Besides KhataBook and PolicyBazaar, it also invested in $35 million, this year, in Bengaluru-based digital banking company NiYO, which also serves outbound tourists with a foreign exchange service.

Pakistani troops violated ceasefire by targeting forward posts and villages along the Line of Control in the twin districts of Poonch and Rajouri in Jammu and Kashmir, an Army spokesman said on Saturday. Pakistani troops initiated unprovoked firing of small arms and shelling with mortars in Balakote sector of Poonch and Nowshera in Rajouri overnight, drawing befitting retaliation by the Indian Army, he said.
The spokesman said Pakistan first violated the ceasefire in Nowshera sector from 8 pm to 10 pm on Friday followed by firing of small arms and shelling with mortars in Balakote from 11.45 pm to 2 am. There was no report of any casualty in the Pakistani firing on the Indian side, he said.

(Reuters) - A bus carrying Chinese tourists careened off a road and crashed near Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah on Friday, killing four people and injuring the remaining 26 people aboard, several of them critically, authorities reported. 
The cause of the crash, which occurred at about 11:30 a.m. on State Route 12 just west of the park, was under investigation, but weather did not appear to be a factor, state Highway Patrol and Garfield County Sheriff’s Department officials said. 
Thirty people, including the driver, were aboard the bus when it swerved across the road and back before rolling over against a guard rail and coming to rest upright, authorities said. Photos from the scene showed the vehicle’s roof crushed in on top of the passenger compartment. 
The 26 survivors were taken to various hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening, according to a Utah Highway Patrol spokesman, Corporal Chris Bishop. At least five people were critically injured, Bishop said, noting that figure was a downward revision from the Highway Patrol’s initial report that 12 to 15 people were critically injured. 
Sheriff’s spokeswoman Denise Dastrup said five of the injured were evacuated to hospitals by helicopter. 
All 29 passengers on the bus were citizens of mainland China, and the driver was Chinese-American, Bishop said. Dastrup said the driver survived the crash, but his condition was not immediately known. 
Because nearly all the victims spoke only Mandarin, communication proved a challenge to authorities, who called for volunteers to help as translators at hospitals where the injured were taken, Dastrup said.  
The Chinese Embassy in Washington said on Twitter that it was sending diplomatic personnel to the area to further assist the victims. “We are saddened to hear about the accident in Utah involving a bus carrying Chinese tourists. We are thankful to authorities in Utah for their assistance,” the embassy said.      
A 14-mile (23 km) stretch of highway around the crash site was shut down in both directions to make way for emergency personnel and accident investigators, Bishop said. 
Bryce Canyon National Park, best known for its spired, multi-hued rock formations called hoodoos, remained open to visitors, though traffic to the park was restricted. While all inbound routes to Bryce Canyon from the north, south and west pass were blocked by the crash site on SR-12, alternate routes from the west were open, park spokesman Peter Densmore said. 
At the time of the crash, Dastrup said, the bus was headed toward Bryce Canyon, located about 270 miles (435 km) south of Salt Lake City, and skies were clear. 
The national park, occupying 55 square miles (14,245 hectares) of southern Utah, attracts some 2 million visitors a year.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will pursue any aggressor, even if it carries out a limited attack, and seek to destroy it, the head of the elite Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday, after attacks on Saudi oil sites which Riyadh and U.S officials blamed on Tehran.    
“Be careful, a limited aggression will not remain limited. We will pursue any aggressor,” the head of the Guards, Major General Hossein Salami, said in remarks broadcast on state TV. “We are after punishment and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.”  
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia’s air and missile defences after the Sept. 14 attacks. 
Iran denies involvement in the attack, which was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran and currently fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen’s civil war. 
Trump’s move drew fire in Washington on Saturday from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it his “latest outrageous attempt” to circumvent Congress.  
“These unacceptable actions are cause for alarm,” Pelosi said in a statement accusing Trump of turning “a blind eye” to Saudi violence against innocent Yemenis, human rights abuses and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
“The United States cannot enable more brutality and bloodshed,” she added. “Congress will do our job to uphold the Constitution, defend our national security and protect the American people.”   
Meanwhile, Amirali Hajizadeh, who heads the Revolutionary Guards’ aerospace branch, said any attacks on Iran would receive “a crushing response”, the official news agency IRNA reported. 
Hajizadeh was speaking at a public exposition called “Hunting Vultures”, where remains of drones which were downed in Iran or crashed there were displayed, along with the Iranian air defence system which shot down a U.S. military drone in June.  
The exposition is part of annual events commemorating the start of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, which also includes air and naval displays in the Gulf and military parades on Sunday.        
Iran’s foreign minister meanwhile denounced renewed U.S. sanctions against its central bank following the Saudi attacks as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine, and said the move was a sign of U.S. desperation. 
The United States on Friday imposed more sanctions, targeting the Central Bank of Iran, which was already under U.S. sanctions, the National Development Fund of Iran - the country’s sovereign wealth fund - and an Iranian company that U.S. officials say is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases. 
“This is a sign of U.S. desperation ... When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under ‘maximum pressure’ has failed,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in remarks shown on state television. 
“But this is dangerous and unacceptable as an attempt at blocking ... the Iranian people’s access to food and medicine,” Zarif said, speaking after arriving in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly next week. 
Separately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi rejected what he called “unreal and repetitious accusations by certain Saudi officials” about the attacks, state media said. 
A senior Saudi official said earlier that Riyadh would wait for the results of a probe before responding to the attacks on its oil facilities, for which it believes Iran is responsible.  
Zarif said he would on Wednesday meet foreign ministers of the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was agreed with Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia as well as the United States.   
“As we have said before, the United States can only attend if it returns to the (nuclear accord) ... and ends its economic war against Iran,” Zarif said. 
The United States withdrew from the accord last year and re-imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran. 
After reports on social media of a cyber-attack on some  petrochemical and other companies in Iran, a state body in charge of cyber security denied there had been a “successful” attack. 
“Based on our observations ... there has not been a successful cyber-attack on oil facilities and other critical infrastructure,” said an official statement carried by IRNA. 
NetBlocks, an organisation that monitors internet connectivity, earlier reported “intermittent disruptions” to some internet services in Iran starting on Friday evening.  
The group said the impact was limited, affecting only specific providers, and the cause was unclear. “Data are consistent with a cyber-attack or unplanned technical incident on affected networks as opposed to a purposeful withdrawal or shutdown incident,” it said in a tweet.  
NetBlocks Director Alp Toker said they saw four Iranian networks falling offline over a three hour period on Friday evening. This began when the first reports emerged and ended shortly afterwards. The networks have been stable since.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has emerged from attacks on its oil facilities “stronger than ever”, Chief Executive Amin Nasser told employees in a message, adding that full oil production would resume by the end of this month. 
The Sept. 14 attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais plants, some of the kingdom’s biggest, caused raging fires and significant damage that halved the crude output of the world’s top oil exporter, by shutting down 5.7 million barrels per day of production. 
“The fires that were intended to destroy Saudi Aramco had an unintended consequence: they galvanized 70,000 of us around a mission to rebound quickly and confidently, and Saudi Aramco has come out of this incident stronger than ever,” Nasser said in the internal message, on the occasion of the Saudi national day, to be celebrated on Sept. 23. 
“Every second counts in moments like these, and had we not acted quickly to contain the fires and undertake rapid restoration efforts, the impact on the oil market and the global economy would have been far more devastating.” 
Six days after the assault, which hit at the heart of the Saudi energy industry and intensified a decades-long struggle with arch-rival Iran, the state oil giant Aramco invited reporters on Friday to observe the damage and the repair efforts. 
Thousands of employees and contractors have been pulled from other projects to work around the clock to bring production back. Aramco is shipping equipment from the United States and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities, Aramco officials told reporters. 
Aramco already brought back part of the lost production and will return to pre-attacks level end of September, Nasser said. 
“Not a single shipment to our international customers has been missed or cancelled as a result of the attacks, and we will continue to fulfil our mission of providing the energy the world needs,” he said in the message, seen by Reuters.     Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had used its reserves to maintain oil supply flows to customers abroad and inside the kingdom. 
Yemen’s Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran. Tehran, which support the Houthis, has denied any involvement in the attacks. 
Saudi Arabia says 18 drones and three missiles were fired at Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil processing facility, while the Khurais facility was hit by four missiles.  
No casualties were reported at either site even though thousands of workers and contractors work and live in the area.

Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwan is pitching India as a potential business destination to its tech, auto, renewable energy and farm sector firms as the United States’ trade war with China has pushed its companies to look for newer markets, two officials said on Friday. 
More than 10,000 Taiwanese companies, including Apple suppliers Foxconn and Wistron have massive operations in China, thanks to its tax incentives, organised supply chain and logistics, efficient business parks as well its cultural ties to the island. 
But a trade war between Washington and Beijing has led to higher tariffs on goods worth tens of billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, prompting companies to look at other countries to escape higher tariffs. 
“This trade war has encouraged more Taiwanese companies to figure out other options. So India and also other ASEAN countries are the alternative markets,” Shih-Chung Liu, vice chairman of Taiwan External Trade Development Council, told reporters. 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional block comprising ten nations in Southeast Asia, which promotes economic, political and military ties between members. 
Beijing maintains that Taiwan, an island 110 miles (177 km) off the Chinese mainland, does not qualify for formal diplomatic ties with any country. And though India has no formal relation with Taiwan, Taipei runs an Economic and Cultural Center in capital New Delhi, which operates as a de facto embassy. 
Taiwanese firms are looking to invest in India’s technology, renewable energy, electric vehicle and farm sectors, Liu said. 
“India is among the most important markets, among those 18 new southbound policy countries.”. 
Taiwan’s southbound policy focuses on strengthening ties in the areas of culture, tourism, education and trade with 18 southeast and south Asian countries. 
It has opened four trade offices in India in the last few years and bilateral trade with Asia’s third-biggest economy stood at $7 billion in 2018. 
Trade between India and Taiwan will likely touch $10 billion over the next few years, said Chung-Kwang Tien, the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre. 
Helping that trade are about 120 Taiwanese information and communications technology firms, which are setting up operations in India’s southern technology hub Bengaluru, Tien said. 
“These companies have already put in $100 million,” he added.

Facebook  has suspended “tens of thousands” of apps connected to its platform which it suspects may be collecting large amounts of user profile data.
That’s a sharp rise from the 400 apps flagged a year ago by the company’s investigation in the wake of Cambridge Analytica, a scandal that saw tens of millions of Facebook profiles scraped to help swing undecided voters in favor of the Trump campaign during the U.S. presidential election in 2016.
Facebook did not provide a more specific number in its blog post but said the apps were built by 400 developers.
Many of the apps had been banned for a number of reasons, like siphoning off Facebook user profile data or making data public without protecting their identities, or other violations of the company’s policies.
Despite the bans, the social media giant said it has “not confirmed” other instances of misusing user data beyond those about which it has already notified the public. Among those previously disclosed include South Korean analytics firm Rankwave, accused of abusing the developer platform and refusing an audit; and myPersonality, a personality quiz that collected data on more than four million users.
The action comes in the wake of the since-defunct Cambridge Analytica and other serious privacy and security breaches. Federal authorities and lawmakers have launched investigations and issued fines from everything from its Libra cryptocurrency project to how the company handles users’ privacy.
Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, said this was not an “accident” as Facebook has claimed.
“Facebook put up a neon sign that said ‘Free Private Data,’ and let app developers have their fill of Americans’ personal info,” he said. “The FTC needs to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible.”
Facebook said its investigation will continue.
Mark Zuckerberg is ‘proud’ of how Facebook handled its scandals this year

YourStory
The euphoria around $1 billion valuations continues unabated in the startup world, but ask a seasoned business icon like Nandan Nilekani for his view on the right way of building businesses, and he says, rather matter-of-factly,

Nandan, who is credited with building India’s digital infrastructure, is a well-known investor, who has backed over a dozen startups, including agritech startup NinjaCart, travel marketplace RailYatri, and startup research platform Tracxn, among others.

Still, prod him further on whether he views his startup investments under the same lens, and he’s quick to admit that some business models do require a significant amount of cash burn. But even with such a business model, the ultimate goal should be to yield profits, he adds.



Nandan, who began investing in startups in 2014, started the $100 million venture capital fund Fundamenteum with Helion Ventures Co-founder Sanjeev Aggarwal in 2017, with a view on making focused investments and helping them grow their business and scale.

“In 2014, when I came back from doing Aadhar, I suddenly realised that there was a startup revolution happening in India, particularly in Bangalore and in Koramangala where I live. I was very keen to understand what was happening so I did a few investments, but then later I realised that I should do something more systematically,” Nandan says.

Today, Fundamenteum prides itself on a partnership model that ‘isn’t limited to capital,’ with the team offering active mentorship to entrepreneurs to build robust organisations.


Going forward, Nandan says the focus will be to make investments in a select group of around 10 startups, so that, a few mentors, including Nandan himself, can work closely with each of these entrepreneurs to grow their companies.

Online food delivery major Zomato has rolled out its membership program Zomato Gold, which has been at the centre of restaurants partners logout movement, for home delivery orders.
Now, the users will be able to use their membership to order food delivery. Existing Zomato Gold members will be allowed to use the benefits without any extra charges. New users will have to pay Rs 1,800 for an annual package.
Gold on Delivery offers the second-highest priced item on the order free. Membership will also be limited to a single device per person and discount will be capped to Rs 300 per order.
The company has roped in another 13,000 restaurants for Gold on delivery.
At present, Zomato Gold for dining-out and delivery is available in 16 cities. Zomato plans to extend the services to over 25 cities by next week. Zomato Gold claims to drive about 30% of business for its restaurant partners.
In the last two years, It has added over 1.1 million members and over 6000 restaurant partners.
The Gurugram-based firm has noticed its membership users exploring new restaurants mostly due to Gold. 
It makes eminent sense to extend this discovery behaviour to the delivery restaurant base, said Gaurav Gupta, Co-founder and COO, Zomato.
However, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) termed the move as a desperate attempt by Zomato to shore up sinking fortunes.
“It is now a program that merely promotes deep discounts on both dine-in and delivery verticals, the cost of which is borne solely by the restaurant partners,” said Anurag Katriar, President, NRAI adding that Zomato Gold in its current form is an unacceptable proposition.
Last month, Deepinder Goyal-led firm had curbed Gold usage and discontinue the trail packs after facing continuous backlash from restaurant partners over deep discounting by restaurant table reservation platforms. 
NRAI called Zomato move as only a knee jerk reaction to the #logout movement and insisted that half measures won’t solve the deep discounting issue.
Earlier, thousands of restaurants had logged out from Gold partnership over deep discounting.

https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/an-explosive-breach-of-contract-lawsuit-against-former-sequoia-capital-partner-michael-goguen-has-been-dropped/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
Three-and-a-half years ago, a lawsuit hit the San Mateo, Calif. county courthouse that briefly attracted the attention of the worldwide venture capital community, given its salacious nature. The defendant: longtime VC Michael Goguen, who’d spent 20 years with Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. The plaintiff: Amber Baptiste, a former intimate who described him through the filing as a “worse predator than the human traffickers.” She said in the filing that she would know, having become a “victim of human trafficking” at age 15 when she was “brought to America in 2001,” then “sold as a dancer to a strip club” in Texas, which is where she says she first encountered Goguen.
What she wanted from the lawsuit was money that she said was owed to her by Goguen: $40 million over four installments that the lawsuit stated was for “compensation for the sexual abuse and [a sexual] infection she contracted from him.” According to her suit, Goguen agreed to these terms, paying Baptiste a first installment of $10 million before refusing to make further payments.
At the time, Goguen called the allegations “horrific” and suggested Baptiste was a spurned lover, saying they’d had a “10+ year romantic relationship that ended badly.” He also filed a cross-complaint alleging extortion.
Today, that cross-complaint lives on, but Baptiste’s case against Goguen was just dismissed by arbitrator Read Ambler, a retired judge who served 20 years with the Santa Clara County Superior Court and who wrote in a ruling filed yesterday in San Mateo that Baptiste’s failures to undergo medical examinations doomed her case, as did her failure to produce documents necessary in the discovery process.
“The record presented further establishes that Baptiste’s’ failures were willful,” Ambler writes. “Baptiste appears to believe that the information responsive to the discovery at issue is either not relevant, or with respect to the medical examinations, not permitted by law. While Baptiste is free to believe what she wants to believe, the orders are binding on Baptiste, and her failure to comply with the orders is unacceptable.”
Baptiste doesn’t currently have legal representation, though four sets of lawyers have represented her over time.
Patricia Glaser, a high-powered attorney, originally took on Baptiste’s case (and later agreed to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein), but she asked to be relieved from the case five months later, citing “irreconcilable differences.” More recently, an LA-based couple that operates the Sherman Law Group filed a motion to be relieved as Baptiste’s counsel, citing “irreconcilable differences and a breakdown in communication.”
Goguen’s attorneys say he will continue to pursue his counterclaims against Baptiste and looks forward to “complete vindication.”
Though Ambler never remarked on the merits of Baptiste’s claims, Goguen’s attorney Diane Doolittle further said today in a statement that: “Amber Laurel Baptiste’s sensationalized lawsuit against Silicon Valley venture capitalist Michael Goguen  collapsed under the weight of its own falsehood yesterday, when a judge dismissed the case because of Baptiste’s repeated, egregious and willful misconduct. Over the course of this case, Baptiste perjured herself, concealed, destroyed and falsified key evidence, and demonstrated her contempt for the legal system by systematically violating numerous court orders.”
Baptiste could not be reached for comment.
Baptiste’s lawsuit against Goguen prompted Sequoia to part ways with him almost immediately. Later the very day that TechCrunch broke news of the suit in 2016, a Sequoia spokesman told us that while the firm understood “these allegations of serious improprieties” to be “unproven and unrelated to Sequoia” its management committee had nevertheless “decided that Mike’s departure was the appropriate course of action.”
Goguen, who sold an $11 million home in Atherton, Calif., in 2017, has spent much of his time in recent years at another home in Whitefish, Mont., where he has seemingly been wooing locals.
An August story about Goguen in The Missoulian about a separate case describes him as “known locally for philanthropic ventures.”
The piece dutifully continues on to note that: “Such donations have funded Montana’s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and a Flathead group teaching girls to code. Two Bear Air, [Goguen’s] northwestern Montana search and rescue outfit free to anyone who has needed it, has performed well over 500 missions and 400 rescues, according to executive director and chief pilot Jim Pierce. Goguen has personally completed 30 rescues, the Daily Inter Lake reported in February. The Flathead Beacon reports he was honored with the Great Whitefish Award earlier this year.”

Three blue plastic trays are seen lying on the floor beyond the baggage screening and security check area of an airport terminal. On closer inspection, plastic containers seem to have some amount of water in them.
The above description is that of an image tweeted by DMK MP Kanimozhi which was taken at the Chennai International Airport. According to the MP, blue baggage trays were placed on the floor by the airport staff to collect rainwater which was leaking from the airport’s ceiling after the city witnessed heavy thunder showers on Thursday - which was recorded to be the wettest day of the year in Chennai.
Tweeting the picture on Thursday, Kanimozhi wrote “First it was the ceiling falling. Now the roof has turned into showers. Plastic containers have been placed to collect the water dripping from above due to rains.

Other problems at airport
The domestic and international terminals at the Chennai airport were expanded and renovated at a cost of Rs 2000 crore in 2013. But since its inauguration, there have been multiple incidents of glass panels collapsing – at least 70 reported incidents. The glass ceiling of the airport had even come crashing down three times within the first six months of the airport's inauguration. Over the years, at least 13 people are reported to have been injured due to such incidents of glass ceiling shattering in the airport. 
In July 2019, G Chandramouli, the director of the Chennai International Airport also received a show cause notice citing safety concerns. 
The notice stated that non-frangible material such as concrete slabs, open concrete trench and chambers were found on the primary and secondary runways of the airport. Further several large loose stones were discovered on the Runway End Safety Area or RESA of both ends of the Chennai airport’s primary runway, reports stated. The DGCA notice added that Chennai’s primary runway also failed the friction test, making the runway slippery for aircraft landings. 
As per the DGCA's findings, the friction reading levels of a portion of the runway was below required levels. A few of the runway signboards and lighting too were not found to be in working condition, the notice further stated.

ANI
Helsinki [Finland], Sept 21 (ANI): The Indian government's move to revoke Article 370 that accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir has a "national security connotation", External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Friday, while emphasising that the country "lives in a tough neighbourhood" and faces more than its fair share of national security challenges.Addressing the Finnish Institute of International Affairs (FIIA), the minister, in an apparent reference to Pakistan, said that the most prominent national security challenge that India has been subjected to for many decades is the "cross border terrrorism", which has cost more than 40,000 lives in the past 3 decades."We are opposed to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and believe there is no justification for it, whatsoever. But it is not just enough to have a position. When subjected to terrorist attacks, any polity that is sincerely committed to the welfare of its people will surely respond," Jaishankar said."And indeed, that is precisely what we have done in recent years. Even the changes that were approved last month by the Indian Parliament with respect to Jammu and Kashmir, while driven by the needs of governance and development, and have a national security connotation," he added.Referring to Pakistan, Jaishankar said that the epicentre of terrorism is "right in our neighbourhood. But even as we take our responsive measures, our belief is that this is not just a concern for one country but for the entire international community."The External Affairs Minister is on a three-day visit to Finland.

The News Minute
Days after the Chief Justice of Madras High Court submitted her resignation after her controversial transfer to the Meghalaya High Court, President Ram Nath Kovind accepted her resignation on Friday. Justice Vineet Kothari, the senior-most judge of the Madras High Court, will be the acting Chief Justice of the Madras High Court till further orders.
The Supreme Court collegium had, in the last week of August, recommended swapping the Chief Justices of two high courts in the country – the Madras High Court and the Meghalaya High Court. According to the decision of the collegium, Justice AK Mittal, the present Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court was to be posted as the Chief Justice of Madras High Court, while Justice VK Tahilramani was to take over AK Mittal’s post in Meghalaya.
The decision had sent shockwaves within the fraternity. While it could have been construed as an advancement for Justice AK Mittal, since the Madras High Court is one of the oldest high courts in India and is the fourth largest one in the country in terms of number of judges, Justice VK Tahilramani was slated to head a court that was set up in 2013 with only three judges.
Though Justice VK Tahilramani had requested the collegium to reconsider its decision, the collegium had refused to do so. Protesting the collegium’s decision, Justice Tahilramani submitted her resignation to the President of India and the Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi in the first week of September.
Justice Tahilramani was sworn in as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court on August 12, 2018, after she was transferred from the Bombay High Court where she served as acting Chief Justice three times between 2015 and 2017. 
Justice Tahilramani had presided over many important and controversial cases during her term in the Bombay High Court. On May 4, 2017, she upheld the life imprisonment of 11 convicts in the gang rape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of her family during the 2002 Gujarat riots. She also set aside the acquittal of seven persons in the case including 5 police officers and 2 doctors, convicting them under sections 201 (tampering of evidence) and 218 (not performing duties) of the Indian Penal Code.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia’s air and missile defenses after the  largest-ever attack on the kingdom’s oil facilities, which Washington has squarely blamed on Iran. 
The Pentagon said the deployment would involve a moderate number of troops - not numbering thousands - and would be primarily defensive in nature. It also detailed plans to expedite delivery of military equipment to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 
Reuters has previously reported that the Pentagon was considering sending anti-missile batteries, drones and more fighter jets. The United States is also considering keeping an aircraft carrier in the region indefinitely.  
“In response to the kingdom’s request, the president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature and primarily focused on air and missile defense,” U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said at a news briefing. 
“We will also work to accelerate the delivery of military equipment to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to enhance their ability to defend themselves.” 
The Pentagon’s late Friday announcement appeared to close the door to any imminent decision to wage retaliatory strikes against Iran following the attack, which rattled global markets and exposed major gaps in Saudi Arabia’s air defenses.  
Trump said earlier on Friday that he believed his military restraint so far showed “strength,” as he instead imposed another round of economic sanctions on Tehran.   
“Because the easiest thing I could do, ‘Okay, go ahead.  Knock out 15 different major things in Iran.’ ... But I’m not looking to do that if I can,” Trump told reporters at the White House. 
But the deployment could further aggravate Iran, which has responded to previous U.S. troop deployments this year with apprehension. It denies responsibility for the attack on Saudi Arabia. 
Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition that includes the UAE, has claimed responsibility for the strikes. 
Relations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated sharply since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports. 
For months, Iranian officials issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran were blocked from exporting oil, other countries would not be able to do so either. 
However, Iran has denied any role in a series of attacks in recent months, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and strikes claimed by the Houthis. 
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have  fingered southwest Iran as the staging ground for the attack, an assessment based at least in part on still-classified imagery showing Iran appearing to prepare an aerial strike.  
They have dismissed Houthi claims that the attacks originated in Yemen. 
One of the officials told Reuters the strike may have been authorized by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.    
The United States is wary of getting dragged into another conflict in the Middle East. It has troops positioned in Syria and Iraq, two countries where Iranian influence is strong and Iran-backed forces operate openly.  
U.S. officials fear Iran’s proxies might attempt to strike American troops there, something that could easily trigger a broader regional conflict. 
Saudi Arabia has said it was attacked by a total of 25 drones and missiles, including Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and “Ya Ali” cruise missiles. 
U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said officials were still hammering out the best array of capabilities to defend Saudi Arabia, noting the difficulty combating a swarm of drones. 
“No single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like that, but a layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk of swarms of drones or other attacks that may come from Iran,” Dunford said.

ABQAIQ, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Friday took media on a tour of oil facilities damaged by attacks that Washington and Riyadh blame on Iran, showing melted pipes and burnt equipment, as Tehran vowed wide retaliation if heightened tensions boil over into hostilities. 
The kingdom sees the Sept. 14 strikes on its Khurais and Abqaiq facilities — the worst attack on Gulf oil infrastructure since Iraq’s Saddam Hussein torched Kuwaiti oilfields in 1991 — as a test of global will to preserve international order. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the United States was imposing sanctions on Iran’s central bank over the attack. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the bank was Tehran’s last source of funds. 
Asked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility. 
Iran denies involvement in the attack, which initially halved oil output from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest petroleum exporter. Responsibility was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen’s four-year-old conflict. 
At Abqaiq, one of the world’s largest oil processing plants, reporters saw a punctured, blackened stabilizer tower that Khalid Buraik, Saudi Aramco vice-president for southern area oil operations, said would have to be replaced. 
As reporters examined a shattered separator dome draped with a red tape labeled “Danger”, Buraik said 15 towers and facilities had been hit at Abqaiq, but it would regain full output capacity by the end of September. 
At Khurais oilfield to the west, which the Saudi defense ministry says was hit by four missiles, Reuters reporters were shown repair work under way, with cranes erected around two burnt-out stabilization columns, which form part of oil-gas separation units, and melted pipes.  
“We are confident we are going back to the full production we were at before the attack (on Khurais) by the end of September,” Fahad Abdulkarim, Aramco’s general manager for the southern area oil operation, told reporters. 
“We are working 24/7...This is a beehive.”  
Workmen wearing red high visibility jackets and white helmets moved through the site, a large compound the size of several football stadiums containing interconnected structures of piping and towers. 
A mound of blackened debris lay on the ground. An executive said the scorched mess once covered much of the surface of the facility but now only a small mound is left.  
Some workers sprayed what appeared to be water on the ground. Mobile cranes and water trucks stood near the crumpled, mangled remains of a fire-damaged stabilization tower.  
The Sept. 14 attacks intensified a years-long struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a sometimes violent contest for influence in several flashpoints around the Middle East.

New Delhi: India's largest domestic airline, InterGlobe Aviation Limited operated IndiGo, on Friday said that the board of directors of the airline has approved the appointment of advocate Pallavi Shardul Shroff as an independent woman director in the company.
Shroff, who's a managing partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, has been inducted in the airline's board, with effect from 19 September, IndiGo said in a statement.
The induction of Shroff into the airline's board of director comes after the shareholders of the company voted in favour of expanding the board’s strength to 10 at the annual general meeting (AGM) in New Delhi on 28 August.
"The aviation sector in India is among the fastest growing internationally and that makes IndiGo’s story and goals quite compelling," Shroff said in a statement.
"I look forward to contributing my experience to support the company in enhancing its growth and maximizing value for its shareholders," she added.
Shroff is currently also a director on the boards of prestigious Indian listed companies like Apollo Tyres Ltd., Trident Ltd. and Asian Paints Ltd. Besides these, she is also on the Boards of One97 Communications Ltd (Paytm's parent company), and Juniper Hotels Ltd.
"Her rich boardroom experience, her deep and extensive knowledge of law, her analytical bent of mind and her problem-solving attitude will considerably strengthen the Board, as it seeks to provide quality leadership to the company," IndiGo's chairman M Damodaran, said in a statement.
IndiGo’s co-promoter Rakesh Gangwal, who is in the midst of a tussle with promoter Rahul Bhatia, had earlier demanded the appointment of an independent woman director in the airline's board.
In an 8 July letter, addressed to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman Ajay Tyagi, Gangwal alleged several violations at IndiGo including those pertaining to related-party transactions (RPTs); appointment of senior management personnel, directors and the chairman, who has always been an independent director by convention.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday attacked the government over its move to cut corporate tax, alleging that the rich will benefit while the poor left to fend for themselves.
The government on Friday slashed corporate tax rates for companies by almost 10 percentage points to 25.17 per cent and offered a lower rate to 17.01 per cent for new manufacturing firms to boost economic growth rate from a six-year low by incentivising investments to help create jobs.
"Howdy Modi. Corporate Diwali. India foregoes 1. 45 lakh cr. revenue. Need Diwali for needy folk!" Sibal said in a tweet.
"Extra money in corporate hands will not boost demand. Need extra money in hands of rural India to spur consumption. The rich will benefit. The poor left to fend for themselves," he said.
The Congress on Friday had termed the corporate tax cut a "panic reaction" by the government and linked it to the ''Howdy Modi'' event in Houston, with Rahul Gandhi saying he is amazed at what Narendra Modi can do for a "stock market bump" before the diaspora programme.

The News Minute
In the second similar incident this year, two stone pillars at the Vijaya Vittala temple at World Heritage site Hampi were found allegedly vandalised. A Bengaluru-based chef, who visited Hampi, has been sent to judicial custody in connection with the incident. 
The incident came to light after officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) noticed Nagaraj, a 45-year-old resident of Yelahanka in Bengaluru, near the pillars. 
While Nagaraj maintains that he accidentally toppled the pillars while taking a selfie, officials informed security personnel who immediately nabbed Nagaraj and turned him over to the police. He was charged under sections of the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958, the Times of India reported.
According to police, Nagaraj admitted that he had caused the pillars to topple. “Since it had been raining for the last few days, the ground holding the historical pillars on the protected heritage site got loose. When the accused pushed one of the pillars, it collapsed onto another pillar, which also fell to the ground. Though it was unintentional, we have booked a case after the ASI lodged a complaint. We have to respect the heritage monuments and the law in force to protect them,” CK Baba, Superintendent of Police, Ballari, told The Hindu. 
This comes seven months after four men were arrested for vandalising stone pillars at a temple in Hampi. They were later ordered by the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Court in Hosapete to help in the restoration of the pillars and pay a fine of Rs 70,000 each. Hampi is located in Ballari district of northern Karnataka.

In July, the holy site of Nava Brindavana of Anegundi near Hampi was also found vandalised. Investigations revealed that a priest from Andhra Pradesh along with a group of people had vandalised the structures at the holy site in search of the treasure of Krishnadevaraya, an emperor of the Vijayanagara empire who reigned from 1509–1529.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The time has come for India’s long-serving wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni to bow out of international cricket - and he should go before he’s pushed, batting great Sunil Gavaskar said. 
Former captain Dhoni has been the subject of intense speculation among fans, ex-players and pundits over when he will retire from international cricket since India’s semi-final exit from the World Cup. 
The veteran of 350 one-dayers, who quit playing tests at the end of 2014, has not provided any hint of what his plans are.  
However he made himself unavailable for India’s tour of the West Indies and instead opted to spend 15 days with India’s territorial army, a reservist force that draws on civilians who can do short stints to assist the military. 
Dhoni was also a notable omission from India’s Twenty20 squad for the ongoing three-match series against South Africa. 
“Nobody knows what’s in MSD’s mind. Only he can clarify what he thinks his future with Indian cricket is,” former India captain and opening batsman Gavaskar told India Today.  
“But he’s now 38, by the time the next T20 World Cup comes he will be over 39 years old. I think India should be looking ahead.” 
Dhoni captained India to the World Twenty20 crown in 2007, and the 50-over World Cup title at home four years later, and enjoys cult status in the cricket-mad country. 
At his prime Dhoni was widely considered the best “finisher” in the game but his electrifying ability to put bowlers to the sword to the end of innings has waned of late, while he has also struggled to make solid starts. Dhoni’s glovework, however, still remains top class. 
The next 50-over World Cup is still four years away but the World Twenty20 will be held in 2020 and Dhoni enjoys unwavering support from India captain Virat Kohli who has publicly backed him on numerous occasions.

Gautam Gambhir retired from all forms of cricket back in December 2018 after representing Delhi in one of the matches in the Ranji Trophy at the Feroz Shah Kotla. Albeit he wasn’t a regular member of the national team in the last few years, he would still be remembered as someone, who played two match-winning knocks in the final of the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 World Cup.
However, the retirement could’ve come way back in 2007. The southpaw made his ODI debut back in 2003, but couldn’t make the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. The Delhi-born was around 25 years old at that time and the rejection got to him, so much so that he wished to bid adieu to the sport.

“In 2007, when I missed the 50-over World Cup, that was the lowest moment in my cricketing career. I had given up on cricket. Before that, I had missed both U-14 and U-19 World Cups. In 2007 I thought I was the closest to play the World Cup, but when they did not include me in the squad, I had given up on cricket,” Gambhir was quoted as saying in India Today.
Just when Gambhir felt down and out, he was in for a surprise. The left-hander was picked in the Indian squad for the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa. He didn’t make a great start and got out for a duck to Mohammad Asif in the first match against Pakistan at the Kingsmead in Durban.
But the rub of the green went his way and he ended the tournament as the leading run-scorer. India defeated Pakistan in the final at the Wanderers in Johannesburg and Gambhir churned out a masterful 75 off 54, though he didn’t get the Man of the Match.
“Then I was chosen in Twenty-20 World Cup in 2007 and I got dismissed for a duck in the first match against Pakistan. But as fate has it, I finished as the leading run-scorer in the World Cup and we ended up winning the tournament so one should never give up,” the veteran added.
From thereon, Gambhir didn’t look back and made a name for himself in all three formats. With 20 centuries and 63 half-centuries, Gautam was one of the most reliable batters at the top of the order. He was once also the ICC’s number one Test batsman back in 2009.

The announcement was made in the Oval Office, where he and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison were scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting.
Trump did not immediately elaborate on the sanctions but noted that they were the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country. The sanctions go “right to the top,” he said.
US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said the latest sanctions action against Tehran was ‘very big’ and that it affected the last source of funds for Iran.
The action comes after Washington accused Iran for the weekend attacks on Saudi oil refineries, a charge Tehran has vehemently denied. Trump said on Wednesday that he has ordered the Treasury Department to “substantially increase” sanctions on the country.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif blasted the new round of sanctions, calling it a “desperate approach” by Washington. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Saturday that the sanctions against the Iran's Central Bank are “nothing new, but same old bans in different form”. He called on the US to “accept that the policy of sanctions is a failed one.”
The US government has imposed a wide range of sanctions since it abandoned the nuclear pact it had signed in 2015, along with Iran and several other world powers.

BENGALURU: National Cricket Academy (NCA) head Rahul Dravid was in attendance on Friday as the Indian players had an optional training session at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. The Indian team after winning the second T20I against South Africa in Mohali reached the Garden City on Thursday and some of the players hit the ground to fine tune their skills under the watchful eyes of head coach Ravi Shastri.
Taking to Twitter, BCCI posted a photo of the two stalwarts meeting at the stadium and wrote: "When two greats of Indian Cricket meet."

With the first game in Dharamsala washed out, the Indians came out all guns blazing in the second game and with skipper Virat Kohli leading from the front, the Men in Blue thrashed the Proteas by 7 wickets.
Speaking after the game, Kohli praised the youngsters for the comprehensive win and said: "When you play like that and win a game for your team, it is always a good feeling. The pitch was very good and an outstanding effort from the bowlers to pull things back. As long as they (youngsters) show character in difficult situations, they are going to present a strong case for themselves in the future."
With the bat, Kohli surpassed Rohit Sharma as the highest run-getter in T20 internationals as he remained unbeaten on 72 to guide the team home. The captain said the knock reminded him of his 82 not out at this very ground against Australia in the 2016 World T20.
"That night (2016 game vs AUS) was a revelation of how fit you can be on a cricket field. Lot of positive signs for us and they'll get many more games to prove their mettle. They are going in the right direction. The badge in front of my shirt -- India -- it is a pride to play for my country. Whatever it takes, whichever format, to get us across the line, I'll do that.
"Adapting in different formats is nothing but a mindset of making your team win. If you want to win a game for your team, you will find a way. That's the most important thing. I never think for myself, it's always about what the team needs. Test cricket, one-day cricket ... the will should be to win the game for your country."

In August 2019, 4.3 million WannaCry infection attempts worldwide were stopped by Sophos-protected endpoints, out of which 8.8% were located in India, according to a new report 'WannaCry Afterschock' on what happened to the malware after the attack began on May 12, 2017.
The research by SophosLabs shows that the WannaCry threat remains rampant, with millions of infection attempts stopped every month, and that while the original malware has not been updated, many thousands of short-lived variants are in the wild.
For instance, 12,480 unique variants were observed by Sophos in late 2018, and 6,963 in August 2019 (80% of them new).
The continued existence of the WannaCry threat is largely due to the ability of these new variants to bypass the ‘kill switch.’ However, when Sophos researchers analyzed and executed a number of variant samples, they found that their ability to encrypt data was neutralized as a result of code corruption.
Because of the way in which WannaCry infects new victims – checking to see if a computer is already infected and, if so moving on to another target – infection by an inert version of the malware effectively protects the device from being infected with the active strain. In short, new variants of the malware act as an accidental vaccine, offering still unpatched and vulnerable computers a sort of immunity from subsequent attack by the same malware.
However, the very fact that these computers could be infected in the first place suggests the patch against the main exploit used in the WannaCry attacks has not been installed – a patch that was released more than two years ago.
The original WannaCry malware was detected just 40 times and since then SophosLabs researchers have identified 12,480 variants of the original code. Closer inspection of more than 2,700 samples (accounting for 98% of the detections) revealed they had all evolved to bypass the ‘kill switch’ – a specific URL that, if the malware connects to it, automatically ends the infection process – and all had a corrupted ransomware component and were unable to encrypt data.

https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/youtube-overhauls-its-problematic-verification-program/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
TechCrunch
YouTube’s  verification program is getting a massive overhaul, the company announced today, which will likely result in a number of less prominent creators losing their verification status. Previously, YouTube allowed any channel that reached 100,000 subscribers to request verification. That limit is being removed, with a change to the verification program that rolls out in October. Going forward, YouTube will focus its efforts on verifying channels that have more of a need to prove their authenticity — like those belonging to a brand, public figure, artist or another creator who might be subject to impersonation, for example.
YouTube says the earlier verification system was established when the site was smaller, but its ecosystem has since grown and “become more complex.”
Instead of looking at a number of subscribers — a metric than can be gamed by bots — the new system will have more murky requirements. YouTube says it’s about “prominence,” which it defines in a number of ways.
For starters, YouTube will determine if the channel represents a “well-known or highly searched for creator, artist, public figure or company.” It will also consider if the channel is widely recognized outside of YouTube and has a strong online presence, or if it’s a channel that has a very similar name to many other channels.
We understand YouTube will use a combination of human curation and algorithmic signals to make these determinations. When asked, the company declined to discuss the specifics, however.

There were several reasons YouTube wanted to change its system, beyond raising the threshold for verification.
The company had run into a similar problem that Twitter once faced — people mistook the verification badge as an endorsement. On Twitter, that issue reached a tipping point when it was discovered that Twitter had verified the Charlottesville rally organizer. Twitter stopped verifying accounts shortly afterward. Its system today is still being fixed, but the project has been put on the back burner.
Similarly, YouTube’s research found that over 30% of users misunderstood the verification badge’s meaning, believing the checkmark indicted “endorsement of content,” not “identity.”
This is problematic for YouTube for a number of reasons, but mainly because the company wants to distance itself from the content on its platform — content that is often racist, vile, false, dangerous, conspiracy-filled and extremist. YouTube wants to be an open site, with all the troubles that entails, but doesn’t want to be held accountable for the terrible things posted there — like the 14-year-old girl who grew to online fame by posting racist, anti-Muslim, anti-LGBTQ videos, or the high-profile star who made repeated racist comments, then gets honored by YouTube with special creator rewards. 
There were other issues with the prior system, as well.
Some creators would fake their verification status, for instance. Before the changes, a verified channel would display a checkmark next to its channel name. This could be easily forged by simply adding a checkmark to the end of a channel name.
Plus, the checkmark itself only really worked when people viewed the channel’s main watch page on desktop or mobile. It didn’t translate as well to interactions in live chats, on community posts or in stories.

By revamping the verification system, YouTube is clarifying that the verification isn’t an endorsement — it’s a neutral statement of fact. It’s also less difficult to forge, and works everywhere the creator interacts with fans.
The updated verification system drops the checkmark in favor of a gray swipe across the channel name (see above).
This applies to both channels and artists. With regards to the latter, it will replace the music note.
The system will roll out in late October, YouTube said, and the new criteria will apply for all channels.
Those who meet the new requirements won’t need to apply — they’ll automatically receive the new verified treatment. Others who didn’t qualify for re-verification will be notified today and will have the option to appeal the decision before the changes take place.
Information on the appeals process will be available in YouTube’s Help Center.
Update, 9/19/19, 1:26 PM ET: Here’s the letter YouTube creators are receiving. Note it refers to a timeframe of “early” instead of “late” October for the changes.

Here’s the email if you stay verified (thanks @thiojoe) –

Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], Sept 20 (ANI): A day after Union Minister Babul Supriyo was allegedly heckled and assaulted in Jadavpur University, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday took out a protest rally here against the "heinous" incident."What happened at Jadavpur University yesterday was a heinous incident. Nowhere in independent India has such an incident ever taken place. A renowned BJP leader was heckled and beaten by Naxals and students of Students' Federation of India (SFI)," BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar told ANI during the protest march.He alleged that Naxals in the region have taken over the university premises as their safe haven."There is no rule of law in the state. The program was a simple discussion on 'good governance'. However, he was heckled and manhandled by some students and the university administration did not take any action. The CPI-M party is behind this incident," Majumdar said.The BJP leader further claimed that only his party can take stringent actions and make the university campus free of "these anti-national forces".Hundreds of BJP workers participated in the rally holding party flags and shouting slogans denouncing the CPIM as well as the university administration.Supriyo was on Thursday allegedly heckled by a section of students at the university, where he went to participate in an event organised by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the RSS.He was stranded in the premises for over six hours before being taken out of the university by Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in his official vehicle. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had visited the university after receiving the information about the incident.Large numbers of police personnel were deployed at the university premises to maintain the law and order in the campus.

We will walk on the path of great leaders like Dr BR Ambedkar and Ram Manohar Lohia to fulfil their dreams and will form a strong government in the state in 2022 assembly elections," Yadav said addressing a press conference here.The former chief minister also welcomed several new members into the party and said that the party is open to accepting anyone in its fold given that they share the same ideology."Poor people are being humiliated in the state. The direction in which the UP government is headed is not right. People from all different religion live in harmony in this country and this is our uniqueness. This uniqueness needs to be upheld," Yadav said.In a veiled attack, the SP chief also accused the BJP of orchestrating the cases against party leader Azam Khan, against whom over 80 FIRs are registered in the state."Why were these people (complainants) silent for years and are only coming out now? These people were called into offices and told to file a complaint against Azam Khan. He is being targeted because he made schools and universities to educate children in the state," Yadav added.

Ecommerce majors Flipkart and Amazon on Thursday said they are monitoring their platforms to ensure sellers do not offer e-cigarettes to comply with the government's ban on such cigarettes in the country.

The government has issued an ordinance to ban e-cigarettes, making the production, import, export, transport, sale or advertisements of such "alternative" smoking devices a cognisable offence attracting jail term and fine.

US-based ecommerce giant Amazon said products listed for sale on Amazon.in are owned and/or sold by such third-party sellers, and the sellers are themselves responsible for compliance with all applicable laws.

"Tobacco products, including Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS), commonly known as electronic cigarette/ e-cigarettes, are not allowed to be listed or sold on Amazon.in as per Amazon policy," it said in a statement.

The statement added that Amazon.in has certain checks in place to ensure restricted and prohibited products do not get listed, and sellers are educated regarding the same.

"However, in case sellers list such products evasively and the same is brought to our knowledge, Amazon.in delists such products and takes appropriate enforcement action against such sellers," it added.

A Flipkart spokesperson said the company was aware of the Ordinance and had immediately alerted its teams to work with sellers to remove all such products off the platform.

"We will continue to monitor the listings to ensure that these products are not available on the platform," the spokesperson added.

According to the Ordinance, first-time violators will face a jail term of up to one year or a fine of Rs 1 lakh, or both. Subsequent offences will attract a jail term of up to three years or a fine of Rs 5 lakh, or both.

The storage of e-cigarettes shall now be punishable with imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of up to Rs 50,000 or both.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the Cabinet had decided to ban e-cigarettes and similar products as they pose health risk to people, especially the youth.

However, e-cigarettes promoting trade bodies, users and other stakeholders slammed the government's move to ban "alternative" smoking device through the Ordinance route, alleging it was a "draconian" step taken in haste to protect the conventional cigarette industry.

TechCrunch
Another startup in India is cashing in on the popularity of WhatsApp,  the most popular app in the country with more than 400 million users, to build a business around it.
Digi-Prex is a seven-month old startup that runs an eponymous online subscription pharmacy in Hyderabad and serves patients with chronic diseases. Patients share their prescription with Digi-Prex through WhatsApp and the startup’s workers then deliver the medication to them on a recurring cycle.
Delivery is not the only thing Digi-Prex is trying to provide. It helps patients better track when they need a new supply of medicine, and checks if they are seeing improvements. The startup has amassed thousands of customers in Hyderabad, Samarth Sindhi, founder of Digi-Prex, told TechCrunch in an interview.
Digi-Prex just closed its seed round from a range of highly-influential VC firms. It’s also one of the largest seed financing rounds for an Indian startup.
The startup has raised $5.5 million from Khosla Ventures,  Vedanta Capital, Y Combinator, Quiet Capital, and SV Angel. Justin Mateen,  a founder of Tinder, also participated in the round, said Sindhi.
“Instead of trying to acquire customers online, we work with physicians and pharmacies to serve customers,” said Sindhi, an alum of Brown University who worked with a healthcare firm in the U.S. before returning to India. The startup shares some margin with physicians and pharmacies, but more importantly, it says this arrangement works for everyone because it is able to serve customers who are living at distant neighborhoods.
Digi-Prex works directly with medicine distributors to secure supplies at lower costs. It then undercuts the pricing of over-the-top counters, providing medicines to its customers at discounted rates.
Sindhi said the startup will use the fresh capital to expand its business to 10 cities in India, and find ways to be more useful to the patients. Some of the things that Digi-Prex is working on includes providing patients with access to better physicians and offering them more information about their disease.
It’s not surprising why Digi-Prex is using WhatsApp as a distribution platform. “When I returned to India, I was fascinated by how nobody was texting anymore. Everyone was doing everything on WhatsApp,” he said.
WhatsApp, which is already the most popular app in India, is increasingly finding business applications in the country. Vahan,  another Y Combinator-backed startup, is using WhatsApp to help blue-collar workers find jobs with logistics companies.

New Delhi: At least six people died on Friday due to poisoning after consuming illicit liquor in Dehradun, Uttarakhand. Reports suggest that the death toll is likely to rise.
Uttarakhand police are looking into the case and an investigation is underway. Similar cases were reported from a village in Tehri district earlier, where two people died after consuming alcohol.

The incident recalls of similar case in February this year in which more than 100 people had died after consuming spurious liquor in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Four to five people were arrested by the UP and Uttarakhand police. The death toll had reached up to 104, with 67 in the UP and 37 in Uttarakhand.
The bootleg deaths had also incited a political storm in the two BJP-led states, where the opposition parties alleged an illegal alcohol trade that had been thriving for years. The Opposition in Uttar Pradesh had even demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over negligence in the matter.

Reuters
(Reuters) - Millions of young people flooded the streets of cities around the world on Friday to demand political leaders take urgent steps to stop climate change, uniting in a worldwide protest inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. 
Alarmed by images of the Greenland ice sheets melting and the Amazon rain forests burning, students and workers abandoned schools, shops and offices in nearly every corner of the globe, aiming to stop what they see as a looming environmental catastrophe. 
The protests started in the Pacific islands, where rising sea levels threaten a way of life, and followed the sun across Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and on to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. The coordinated student “strike” culminated in New York’s Wall Street, where some investors have embraced the fossil fuel industry. 
Massive crowds overwhelmed the streets of lower Manhattan, chanting “Save our planet!” while anticipating an address by Thunberg, an international figure who sailed across the Atlantic in an emissions-free yacht ahead of next week’s climate summit at the United Nations. 
“Right now we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action, then we will,” Thunberg told tens of thousands of people gathered at a park with a view of the Statue of Liberty. 
Once she took the stage, the crowd chanted her name, then went silent to hang on her every word. As she paused between sentences, people erupted into applause. 
“If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you. Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not,” she concluded. 
Demonstrators in Paris raised a painting of Thunberg as the Virgin Mary, a halo around her head reading, “Our house is on fire.”    
“She’s like the icon of our generation,” New York protester Fiamma Cochrane, 17, said, highlighting the leadership role of young people in the international movement to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. 
Four million people participated worldwide including 300,000 in New York, organizers with the anti-fossil fuels group 350.org said. Reuters could not verify the crowd sizes. 
Concern has escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the international Paris Accord on climate change and took a series of steps to dismantle environmental protections, including moving on Thursday to block stricter vehicle emissions standards in California. 
Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are among the world’s only national leaders who publicly question the science of climate change, and they are not taking part in next week’s U.N. climate summit. 
Thousands gathered across Brazil to take aim at Bolsonaro, who they say is allowing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest to clear space for soy beans and cattle ranching. In August, fires there surged to their greatest level since 2010.  
“The policy of the Bolsonaro government is the policy of environmental destruction and deepening the climate crisis ... this is why we’re on strike,” said Marcela Pimentel Miranda, an organizer for Youth for Climate’s affiliate in Brasilia. 
One protester in Sao Paulo held up a picture of Bolsonaro and Trump beneath the hand-written “Abolish fossil fools!”  
Demonstrators in Thailand stormed the environment ministry and feigned death, while activists in Berlin and Munich stood on  melting blocks of ice with nooses around their necks to symbolize the earth’s fate when the polar ice caps melt.     
Protesters in Warsaw staged a performance of people drowning in a sea of plastic waste. 
“The planet is getting hotter than my imaginary boyfriend,” read a poster held by a teenager in Thailand. 
“Make love, not CO2” signs were spotted in Berlin and Vienna. 
While Europeans filled the streets, students in the Solomon Islands gathered at the rising ocean water’s edge wearing traditional grass skirts. The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels. 
Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, according to scientists. 
“There is no Planet B,” read a sign hoisted by a young woman in London. 
In Kenya, around 500 activists marched to demand that the government cancel plans for a coal plant and investigate corruption in hydropower dams. 
“In Samburu there is a lot of heat, the grass has dried up, there is little water,” said Francis Lentel, a young herdsman in traditional beads, holding a picture of the Earth weeping. 
The protest movement is putting increasing pressure on governments and companies to respond.   
German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a new climate protection package thrashed out by parties in her coalition during all-night talks. 
Private industry has also responded. Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos on Thursday pledged to make the largest U.S. e-commerce company net carbon neutral by 2040. 
Hundreds of workers from Google, Amazon and other technology companies on Friday criticized their industry for being slow to tackle climate change and joined marches in San Francisco and Seattle calling for action.

Reuters
TAIPEI (Reuters) - China offered airplanes and ferries to lure the Pacific island nation of Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations, Taiwan said on Friday, as the self-ruled island lost a second ally to Chinese pressure in less than a week. 
The switch, just days after the Solomon Islands cut ties, deals a fresh blow to President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January, as it takes to seven the tally of allies lost to China since she took office in 2016. 
Taiwan has terminated diplomatic ties with Kiribati and will immediately shut its embassy there, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters. 
“According to information obtained by Taiwan, the Chinese government has already promised to provide full funds for the procurement of several airplanes and commercial ferries, thus luring Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations,” he added. 
China was trying to “suppress and reduce Taiwan’s international presence” and “ultimately destroy Taiwan’s sovereignty,” Wu said. 
“It is blatantly obvious that the Chinese government, by creating these diplomatic incidents, seeks to manipulate public opinion in Taiwan, influence Taiwan’s upcoming presidential and legislative elections, and undermine its democratic processes.” 
The Kiribati president’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China “highly appreciated” Kiribati’s decision to re-establish ties with Beijing, severed in 2003 when Tarawa recognised Taipei. 
Asked how much money China was offering Kiribati, Geng said principles and trust could not be bought but added that Kiribati would have “unprecedented development opportunities” with China by its side. 
China claims Taiwan as its territory, and says the democratic island has no right to formal ties with any country. 
Friday’s switch leaves Taiwan with formal relations to just 15 countries.  
“They have chosen to give up a sincere friend and become a chess piece for China. We think it’s a huge mistake,” Tsai told reporters, warning of more “Chinese intimidation” ahead of the vote in January.  
“They have one single goal - to reverse the presidential campaign. They are trying to tell Taiwanese that we can’t buy jets, we can’t support Hong Kong and that we can only elect a president who bows to pressure from China.” 
Since Tsai took office, China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan, by flying regular bomber patrols around the island, for example. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan’s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. 
Aid requested by Kiribati from Beijing includes loans and a Boeing 737 aircraft, said a senior official in Taiwan with direct knowledge of the matter who sought anonymity. 
Citing intelligence gathered by Taipei, the source said China aimed to peel away more of Taiwan’s allies before the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1. 
“That worries several countries in the region, including the United States and Australia,” said the official, citing fears over China’s growing influence in the Pacific.  
Kiribati is the seventh country to drop Taiwan as a diplomatic ally since 2016, following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, El Salvador and the Solomon Islands. 
Taiwan’s main opposition, the China-friendly Kuomintang party, urged Tsai’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to review its policy towards Beijing.  
“The DPP should examine the real cause behind the breaking of ties and propose a practical solution,” it said in a statement. 
“It should not continue to shift the responsibility to the former ally, the mainland authorities or the opposition party.”   
A spokesman for Taiwan’s presidential office said, “With the breaking of ties, China is forcing Taiwan to accept ‘one country two systems,’” referring to an arrangement that guarantees certain freedoms to the Chinese-ruled city of Hong Kong.    
“The more Taiwan shows that it’s not being intimidated, the more it frustrates China’s scheme,” added the spokesman, Yun-kung Ting.

Cricket Country
South Africa’s left-arm wristspinner Tabraiz Shamsi feels that T20 is a batsman’s game in which bowlers like him “spoil the party”. Shamsi, 29, returned figures of 1/19 in three overs during the second T20I in Mohali and is now looking forward to drawing the series level at the Chinnaswamy Stadium which used to be his “home ground” until a couple of seasons back, when he used to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore.

“I feel it puts all the more pressure on the batsman to go out there and do what people want to see. So as bowlers, we are just there to spoil the party and make sure that we execute our plans well,” Shamsi, who has played 17 ODIs and 15 T20 Internationals for the Proteas, told PTI in an interview.
“Chinnaswamy is a small stadium and I mean it’s a T20 series, so people obviously are coming there to see batsmen hit fours and sixes. They are not there to see you bowl a maiden over and that’s what it’s all about,” he said.
Shamsi’s stint at RCB has helped him grow as a cricketer with the likes of Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle offering him useful tips.
“Definitely, it helps when you are around speaking to world-class players like Virat, Gayle and Shane Watson. The world of cricket is shrinking in the sense that everyone is ready to share knowledge,” he said. “You will find senior South African fast bowlers imparting knowledge to Indian fast bowlers and vice-versa. Being familiar with surroundings while playing for RCB will certainly help.”
Over the years, South Africa had Imran Tahir at their disposal but with the legspinner not around, Shamsi has a golden opportunity to lay a strong case for himself and cement a place as his team’s premier wristspinner.
“I don’t see this as an additional responsibility. When Immy was there in the team, my job was to do what’s best for the team and obviously with him not being there, I am the only wrist spinner in the team. But I have not shied away from challenges and India is another one of those,” he said.
“Being a legspinner myself, I know guys tend to help each other out as it’s a small club and we know how tough our art is. I found spending a lot of time with Tahir but I have found all the leg-spinners in the other teams easy-going.”
In terms of idols, Shamsi draws inspiration from Australia chinaman bowler Brad Hogg.
“Hogg, I used to watch his bowling a lot during my growing up years. He was the only left-arm wrist spinner playing the game then. But if you see knowledge is everywhere and you just have to be open-minded and to be able to pick things that works for you and leave things that don’t work for you,” Shamsi said.

TechCrunch
Twitter’s  controversial “Hide Replies” feature, aimed at civilizing conversations on its platform, is launching today in the U.S. and Japan after earlier tests in Canada. The addition is one of the more radical changes to Twitter to date. It puts people back in control of a conversation they’ve started by giving them the ability to hide those contributions they think are unworthy.
These replies, which may range from the irrelevant to the outright offensive, aren’t actually deleted from Twitter. They’re just put behind an extra click.
That means people who come into a conversation to cause drama, make inappropriate remarks or bully and abuse others won’t have their voices heard by the majority of the conversation’s participants. Only those who choose to view the hidden replies will see those posts.

Other social media platforms don’t give so much power to commenters to disrupt conversations. On Facebook and Instagram, for example, you can delete any replies to your own posts.
But Twitter has a different vibe. It’s meant to be a public town square, where everyone has a right to speak (within reason.)
Unfortunately, Twitter’s open nature also led to bullying and abuse. Before today, the only options Twitter offered were to mute, block and report users. Blocking and muting, however, only impact your own Twitter experience. You may no longer see posts from those users, but others still could. Reporting a tweet is also a complicated process that takes time. It’s not an immediate solution for a conversation rapidly spinning out of control.
While “Hide Replies” will help address these problems, it ships with challenges of its own, too. It could be used as a way to silence dissenting opinions, including those expressed thoughtfully, or even fact-checked clarifications.
Twitter believes the feature will ultimately encourage people to better behave when posting to its platform.
“We already see people trying to keep their conversations healthy by using block, mute, and report, but these tools don’t always address the issue. Block and mute only change the experience of the blocker, and report only works for the content that violates our policies,” explained Twitter’s PM of Health Michelle Yasmeen Haq earlier this year.

Since launching in Canada in July, Twitter said that people mostly used the feature to hide replies they found were irrelevant, abusive or unintelligible. User feedback was positive, as well, as those who used the tool said they found it was a helpful way to control what they saw, similar to keyword muting.
In a survey, 27% of those who had their tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future, Twitter said. That’s not a large majority, but it’s enough to make a dent. However, it’s unclear how representative this survey was. Twitter declined to say how many people used the feature or how many were surveyed about its impacts.
The system will now also ask users who hide replies if they also want to block the account, as a means of clarifying that “hiding” is a different function.
“These are positive and heartening results: the feature helped people have better conversations, and was a useful tool against replies that deterred from the person’s original intent,” explained Twitter in a blog post, shared today. “We’re interested to see if these trends continue, and if new ones emerge, as we expand our test to Japan and the U.S. People in these markets use Twitter in many unique ways, and we’re excited to see how they might use this new tool,” the post read.
Despite the expansion, Twitter says “Hide Replies” is still considered a test as the company is continuing to evaluate the system, and it’s not available to Twitter’s global user base.
The new feature will start rolling out at 2 PM PT in both the U.S. and Japan and will be available across mobile and web clients.

The New Indian Express
KOLKATA: Describing the students who protested against him at a university here as "cowards and hooligans", Union Minister Babul Supriyo on Friday said that they would not be dealt with in the same manner as they had done, but "rehabilitated mentally" so that they "behave as students".
Posting pictures of his assault at Jadavpur University campus on September 19, Supriyo, Union Minister of State for Environment, said those who were involved in his assault would be "found out" soon.

"These cowards will not be allowed to malign & tarnish the image of #JadavpurUniversity. U shall be found out by us soon but dont worry, you shall not be treated in the manner you treated me," Supriyo said in a tweet while posting pictures of his assault on Friday afternoon.
"We shall rehabilitate you mentally so that you & your Hooligan Friends (all footages available with the media) behave like you are supposed to behave as students till then," he said.
Zeroing in on a picture of a student pulling him by his hair, Supriyo in another tweet, wondered what action would the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government take against the student for assaulting him (Supriyo) without any provocation.
"This is the guy who led the assault in #JadavpurUniversity. We will find him out and then see what @MamataOfficial does to him in terms of charging him for assault without ANY PROVOCATION whatsoever from our/my side," he said in a tweet.

Babul Supriyo was on Thursday shown black flags and heckled by a section of students at Jadavpur University, who also stopped him from leaving the campus, prompting West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to rush to the campus.
Supriyo had gone to the university to address a seminar organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) - the student wing of the RSS.
The governor, who is the chancellor of the university, too faced demonstrations by the students belonging to left-leaning organisations including SFI and AFSU, Naxalite students' wing AISA, besides a few members of the TMCP, university sources said.
The agitating students ended the blockade after the police and the university teachers persuaded them and the governor left the place with the minister in his car.

Daily Mail
A volcano on Io is on the brink of erupting, report scientists who have analysed observations of Jupiter's innermost moon going back decades.
Although it is difficult to predict when most volcanoes will erupt, Io's 'Loki Patera' — named after the Norse god — typically follows a relatively regular timetable.
Loki, which is around 126 miles (203 kilometres) wide, has a lava lake at its centre that can be seen by telescopes on Earth and periodically overturns during eruptions.

A volcano on Io, pictured, is on the brink of erupting, report scientists who have analysed observations of Jupiter's innermost moon going back decades
Loki Patera is the largest volcano on Jupiter's innermost moon, Io.
The volcano is so bright when seen with infrared light that it can be detected by telescopes on the Earth. 
It is around 126 miles (203 km) wide, with a lava lake at its centre. 
In 2002, researchers revealed that Loki was erupting relatively regularly.
In the 1990s, this was about every 540 days — but this has now increased to a cycle of around 475 days.
'Loki is the largest and most powerful volcano on Io, so bright in the infrared that we can detect it using telescopes on the Earth,' said Julie Rathbun, a researcher at the Planetary Science Institute in Tuscon, Arizona.
Based on more than two decades of such observations, researchers have been able to keep track of Loki's eruptions — events that cause the volcano to appear temporarily brighter.
In 2002, Dr Rathbun and colleagues revealed that the volcano was largely following a relatively regular schedule — erupting around every 540 days in the 1990s.
This timetable would appear to have accelerated, however, with Loki now venting magma around every 475 days instead.
'If this behaviour remains the same, Loki should erupt in September 2019,' said Dr Rathbun.
The researchers had correctly predicted the volcano's last eruption, which took place in May 2018. 
They explain that volcanoes are typically so difficult to predict because of their complexity.
Many factors influence volcanic eruptions, including the type and state of the rocks around the volcano, as well as the magma's composition, supply rate and levels of internal gases.
Although it is difficult to predict when most volcanoes will erupt, Loki Patera typically follows a relatively regular timetable. Pictured: Jupiter's innermost moon, Io, on which Loki is found

'We think that Loki could be predictable because it is so large,' said Dr Rathbun.
'Because of its size, basic physics are likely to dominate when it erupts, so the small complications that affect smaller volcanoes are likely to not affect Loki as much.'
'However, you have to be careful because Loki is named after a trickster god and the volcano has not been known to behave itself.'
'In the early 2000s, once the 540 day pattern was detected, Loki’s behaviour changed and did not exhibit periodic behaviour again until about 2013.'
Dr Rathbun and colleagues will keep a close eye on the volcano to see if it does erupt as predicted.
The full findings of the study were presented in a poster on September 17 at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, which was held in Geneva, Switzerland.

The New Indian Express
PATNA: With reports of mob violence growing in Bihar, Nitish Kumar government has decided to sack the persons accused of mob violence if they are government employees. Those, who are not government employees, will automatically be disqualified for any government job in future.
Bihar has witnessed 39 mob violence cases in Patna, Sasaram, Jehanabad and other districts. Police have named 345 people and arrested 278 people in connection with these cases. 
Earlier on Friday, four persons including three officials of Darbhanga’s Child Protection Unit (CPU) were brutally beaten up by an unruly mob in Sitamarhi district on suspicion of being child-lifters. The mob also attacked on police team which rushed to rescue the officials and vandalised their vehicles. 
Three children aged between 7 and 13 were recently rescued from different locations in Darbhanga by the CPU volunteers, according to assistant director of child protection unit of Darbhanga, Ravi Shankar Tewary. 
“CPU officials took those children to Sitamarhi to identify their villages by showing them various landmarks which they had roughly recalled during counselling. Upon seeing the children moving in a car with four persons, the locals mistook the officials as child-lifters and started thrashing brutally menacingly in a way to lynch them”, Tewary said.
All of them - Raghav Thakur, Balmukund Kumar, Nilesh Kumar and driver of vehicle Daya Jha -- have been admitted in a government hospital of Sitamarhi in critical conditions.
Meanwhile, Sitamarhi police said that an FIR has been lodged against dozens of unknown persons and four others arrested in connection with mob violence.

Times Now
Actor-director and sportsperson Rahul Bose will soon be signing up for "deceased organ donation" and would be pledging "every square inch" of his body for donation after death.

Bose, in a conversation with IANS, made the announcement and said that he is happy to "pledge everything" from bone, tissue, cornea, and every single part human beings can benefit from. "I'll pledge every square inch of my body," said the 52-year-old actor.

The Japanese Wife actor is a panelist at an upcoming discussion organised by CII's Indian Women Network and Yi (Young Indians) Delhi Chapters on September 24 in New Delhi. According to Bose, he will be formally signing up for donation of his organs on the date.

He already supports the causes of equalizing development through children's education and preventing child sexual abuse through his foundations.

"It's very simple for me, I take any way by which I can help human beings lead a better life... I've dedicated the last 14 years of my life to these causes and supporting many other causes in a smaller way. So, if I can help other human beings (by donating organs), why wouldn't I?"

"If you're going to die, (and post that) if your body can be used to benefit 8-9 other human beings in terms of organs, what would be greater good karma."

The event, happening in partnership with MOHAN (Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network) Foundation is backed by industry and commerce body CII, which gives the actor some hope about the mainstreaming of organ donation in India. "It's so unpopular right now... In India, there's one organ donor per 1 million people, whereas in Spain, there are 49 per 10 lakh people."

Does he encourage more and more people to donate their organs? "I would encourage other people to find out more about it, allay their fears, superstitions and irrational beliefs. Only when you're satisfied, they definitely should." Bose was recently in news for a Rs 442 bill he was given at a Chandigarh hotel for just two bananas.

Times Now
American singer Aaron Carter, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, made a shocking revelation that his late sister, Leslie, sexually abused him during his childhood. The 31-year-old singer dropped the bombshell on Thursday, alleging via Twitter which shook everyone.
The charges of sexual abuse comes amid an ongoing feud between the singer and his brother Nick Carter, who said he and Aaron's twin sister Angel, both have taken out a restraining order against Aaron "in light of Aaron's increasingly alarming behaviour and his recent confession that he harbours thoughts and intentions of killing my pregnant wife and unborn child."
Aaron said that this disease runs in his family and the condition can worsen which got in his sister's case.
"It runs in the family. I never wanted to tell anyone this. But I have too..." he began in a series of tweets. "My sister Leslie suffered from bipolar and took lithium to treat it. She never liked the way it made her feel and when she was off of it she did things that she never meant to do I truly believe that. I was 10 years old...."
Continuing, he wrote, "My sister raped me from the age of 10 to 13 years old when she wasn't on her medications and I was abused [sic] not only sexually by her but by my first two back up dancers when I was 8 years old. And my brother abused [sic] me my whole life."
Pointing out a finger on his brother in the final tweet, Aaron said that it's his brother's turn now to "to tell the truth."
"Now it's Nicks turn to tell the truth of what he did to one of the girls in my family. Since my truth is all out there and I hope all survivors of assault or rape find peace and justice," Aaron tweeted.

Times Now
Chinese tech giant Huawei launched its latest high-end smartphone in Munich on Thursday, the first of its mobile devices not to carry popular Google apps because of US sanctions.
"Today because of the US ban we cannot pre-install" Google's applications, said Richard Yu, who heads Huawei's consumer business group, as he unveiled the group's latest Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro models.
But heading off fears that a phone without popular apps like Whatsapp, YouTube or Google Maps could not succeed, he stressed that the equivalent platform by the Chinese giant offered a choice of 45,000 apps through the Huawei App Gallery.
Yu added that the Chinese giant was investing US$1 billion (900,000 euros) into its Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) core software ecosystem, as he urged app developers to bring their creations to the system.
Huawei, targeted directly by the United States as part of a broader trade conflict with Beijing, was added to a "blacklist" in Washington in May.
Since then, it has been illegal for American firms to do business with the Chinese firm, suspected of espionage by President Donald Trump and his administration.
As a result, the new Mate will run on a freely available version of Android, the world's most-used phone operating system that is owned by the search engine heavyweight.
While Mate 30 owners will experience little difference in the use of the operating system, the lack of Google's Play Store -- which provides access to hundreds of thousands of third-party apps and games as well as films, books and music -- could be unsettling.
Household-name services like WhatsApp, Instagram and Google Maps will be unavailable.
The tech press reports that this yawning gap in functionality has left some sellers reluctant to stock the new phones, fearing a wave of rapid-fire returns from dissatisfied customers.
With the trade conflict with the US unlikely to be resolved imminently, Huawei has little choice but to ramp up the development of its own "ecosystem" of devices, apps and services that would bind-users more closely to it.
The world's second-largest smartphone maker after Samsung, Huawei earlier this month presented its proprietary operating system HarmonyOS, a potential replacement for Android.
The Mate 30 will not yet have HarmonyOS installed.
But it could make for a new round in the decades-old "OS wars" between Microsoft's Windows and Apple's Mac OS, then Android versus Apple's iOS.
Meanwhile, Eric Xu, current holder of Huawei's rotating chief executive chair, has urged Europe to foster an alternative to Google and Apple.
That could provide an opening for Huawei to build up Europe's market of 500 million well-off consumers as a stronghold against American rivals.
"If Europe had its own ecosystem for smart devices, Huawei would use it... that would resolve the problem of European digital dependency" on the United States, Xu told German business daily Handelsblatt.
He added that his company would be prepared to invest in developing such joint European-Chinese projects.

TechCrunch
After a week of launching new services to bring payments giant Stripe into the areas of lending and credit, the company is announcing another big step forward to fuel its growth: it’s raising another $250 million in funding at a pre-money valuation of $35 billion, money to fuel more international expansion, launching more products and targeting larger enterprise-sized businesses.
This is a huge jump in valuation for the company: Stripe  was valued at $22.5 billion earlier this year when it raised $100 million.
The startup said that General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia are all in the round already. We’ve also heard that SoftBank had been considering an investment. “It was a big miss when SoftBank didn’t invest two years ago,” one source close to the VC said to TechCrunch. But we’ve confirmed also with John Collison — the president of Stripe who co-founded the company with his brother Patrick (who is the CEO) — that SoftBank is not in this round.
Nor will there be any corporate strategics involved in this round. Of note, Collison today confirmed that the bank providing the financial backing for its new cash advance and corporate card services is Celtic Bank, based in Salt Lake City. But the bank is not taking a strategic investment in the company as part of that deal.
Although the round is not yet closed, Collison said the $250 million size is unlikely to change. The round should close in the next several weeks, he added.
Stripe has long been reluctant to talk about when it might consider going public, and this round will put that prospect off even further. “We are still very happy as a private company,” Collison said today. “Our emphasis remans on the long-term opportunities.”
Stripe spent the first several years of its life slowly building up its payments business — which primarily consisted of providing an API to e-commerce businesses so that they could easily integrate a payments option in their apps or websites. 
But in more recent years, it’s started to accelerate its growth with a significantly larger range of financial services — notably, now it describes its business as a “Global Payments and Treasury Network.” The latest products — cash advances and credit cards — are coming on the heels of other services that include incorporation services, fraud protection and and more. 
All this means not only that the company can diversify its own revenues, but it can differentiate itself from (or, in some cases, offer the same services as) its competitors. Others offering similar services to Stripe’s include PayPal and Adyen on the payments front, but as it adds more services, it’s also opening new competitive fronts with other rivals, now including Square, Brex and Clearbanc.
While the U.S. remains Stripe’s main market, especially for new launches, it’s getting increasingly global. The company last week expanded its payments out to eight more countries and that is set to expand again to total 40 in the coming months. 
The company says it processes “hundreds of billions of dollars a year for millions of businesses worldwide,” although it declines to give specific numbers. Wayfair, Airbnb, Twilio, GitHub and The RealReal are among the kind of “enterprise” customers that it hopes to target more. Indeed, as startups in e-commerce grow into huge businesses, they are turning from being the kinds of small companies that Stripe used to target into the big companies that it now wants to target.
“This comes in the context of the fact that we feel strongly about Stripe’s role in the growing internet economy,” Collison said. 
As we have pointed out before, the internet economy, for all its seeming ubiquity, is still a small part of all commerce, which is one reason brick and mortar is likely to be another target for Stripe in the long run, building on the point-of-sale services it already provides — even as the company continues to reap the rewards of its traction in the digital universe.
“Even now, in 2019, less than eight percent of commerce happens online,” said John Collison, president and co-founder of Stripe, in a statement announcing the round. “We’re investing now to build the infrastructure that’ll power internet commerce in 2030 and beyond. If we get it right, we can help the internet fulfill its potential as an engine for global economic progress.”

Competition is an integral part of startups, and it separates great companies from the ordinary. Sometimes cut-throat competition and aspiration for scale also force entrepreneurs to compromise with ethics. The Indian startup ecosystem has witnessed the ugly fight between several direct competitors, including OYO-Zo Rooms and Meru-Uber.
OYO had levelled data theft allegation on Zo Rooms and dragged the Tiger Global-backed firm in the court. Making similar allegations, Meesho has slapped legal notices to nine ex-employees for joining its competitor GlowRoad.
The notices alleged that ex-employees had stolen confidential data and GlowRoad had actively poached these employees to utilise the data to their benefit. The Facebook-funded company also initiated a case against GlowRoad and nine of its ex-employees in Bangalore civil court. 
In a blogpost, Meesho claims that GlowRoad has been engaged in unlawful and unethical business practices, methodically poaching employees and accessing the data that was generated by the company. It claims to have proof of data theft and GlowRoad forcing people to steal data and solicit employees.
As per Meesho, the court has restrained GlowRoad from utilising the confidential data gained through the former employees of Meesho.
However, GlowRoad’s co-founder Shekhar Sahu strongly opposed the move taken by Meesho and called it an act of unprofessionalism and corporate bullying. 
“Meesho is threatening our employees, most of whom left the company a year ago,” Sahu told Entrackr. He further questioned the timing of the legal notices, as they are served after six months or a year employees left the company.
Just because we are doing better than them in growth aspects, they are resorting to harassing our employees, added Sahu. In a Linkedin post, he said that Meesho legal notices to its employees are against freedom of choice.
“We will strongly reply to these frivolous legal notices sent to some of our employees by Meesho so that this case can be set as a landmark example for any company that tries to take freedom of employees away, “he said.
Both Glowroad and Meesho compete in the social commerce space.
In the last two years, GlowRoad has raised $24.3 million. The company claims to have more than 6 million resellers currently. Whereas Meesho has raised more than $200 million and claims to have over 10 million resellers on its platform.

Reuters
GENEVA (Reuters) - Close to 2,000 United Nations employees have called for the global body to reduce its carbon footprint, including through curbs on their own diplomatic perks like business-class flights and travel handouts, a letter obtained by Reuters showed. 
The United Nations calls climate change the “defining issue of our time” and is hosting a New York summit on it next week. But reformers within say in the letter addressed to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that it needs more radical change to get its own house in order. 
“Our commitments need to be more ambitious and at least as concrete as those of the UN Member States and non-party stakeholders attending the UN Climate Action Summit,” said the letter, signed by at least 1,950 employees. It was organized by a group called Young UN, an internal network committed to ensuring the organization embodies the principles it stands for. 
“As Greta Thunberg just sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and young people across the world continue to strike every Friday, let us look at our own impact and take bold steps to address the climate emergency,” the letter said, referring to the Swedish teenager who has inspired global climate strikes. 
The United Nations emitted 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018, according to its own data which includes both the 44,000 secretariat staff present in more than 60 countries as well as tens of thousands of interns, contractors and peacekeeping troops deployed worldwide.  
That equates to a carbon footprint larger than several of its member states, including Malta and Liberia, according to statistics from the Global Carbon Atlas for 2017. 
Among 10 issues identified by Young UN are travel allowances, which the letter said needed to be cut or scrapped “in order to disincentivize travel by UN employees and UN meeting participants motivated by financial gain”. 
Allowances, or per diems as they are known internally, are intended to cover travel costs including food and accommodation, and can exceed $400 a day for some locations such as New York, according to the International Civil Service Commission website. 
The letter also suggested that staff should be rewarded for downgrading from business class, where a spacious seat generates several times the emissions of an economy class ticket.  
Travel accounts for nearly half the United Nations’ emissions, its data show. Last year, under pressure from member states, the head of the U.N. Environment Programme, Erik Solheim, stepped down amid criticism of his travels. 
Other reforms recommended in the letter include a complete divestment of the more than $60 billion U.N. pension fund from fossil fuels and creating offices run entirely on renewable energy. Young UN did not respond to requests for comment. 
Guterres is seeking to combat climate change from within in order to boost sustainability. 
“The Secretary-General welcomes the initiative of Young UN on climate action in the UN system,” Guterres’ office said in a statement to Reuters on Friday. 
“The Secretary-General is committed to lead by example and calls for transformative action to address the climate crisis, including on the part of the UN system and Secretariat itself,” it continued. 
The employees’ letter welcomed Guterres’ internal strategy but said it “misses the urgency of the crisis we are facing”.  
The United Nations has also launched a “Greening the Blue” initiative which measures the U.N. system’s greenhouse gas emissions, waste disposal, fresh-water use, and environmental management. According to its latest report issued on Friday, 55 of its entities, or 95 percent, including the Secretariat, were climate neutral in 2018, against just over a third the previous year. 
But the letter raises doubts about U.N. offset mechanisms, a method that works through purchases of U.N.-certified carbon credits from approved green projects and is widely used by organizations and businesses to tout their green credentials.  
This echoes criticism from NGOs about the contribution of offsets to sustainable development. 
Isabella Marras, Sustainable UN Coordinator, whose team produces the Greening the Blue report and was a signatory to the letter, said she saw scope for the United Nations to give even greater attention to environmental considerations. 
“What we are missing is the aggressive integration of environmental issues into our programs like the UN has done for women,” she told Reuters. But she stressed some of the pragmatic challenges in regions where environmental standards are less strong than in Western countries. 
Marie-Claire Graf, a 23-year-old Swiss climate activist visiting the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva, said the number of U.N. vehicles in vast carparks overlooking the lake and mountains was surprising. 
“The UN is doing some amazing things on environment but I am shocked by so many SUVs and the amount of travel,” said Graf, who was selected along with 100 young climate leaders to attend the U.N. Youth Climate Summit on 21 September. 
“The UN needs to lead on this transformation.”

Texas [US], Sept 20 (ANI): Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much-anticipated address at 'Howdy Modi' event, a tropical storm has triggered relentless and heavy rains in Texas leading to flash flooding in some parts of the state.Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster in 13 counties impacted by remnants of tropical storm Imelda.National Weather Service is calling Imelda a "particularly dangerous situation," and urging residents to "seek higher ground now!". Rain may continue into Friday in parts of eastern Texas and western Louisiana.Hundred of flights were cancelled into and out of Houston area airport due to severe rain.Imelda dropped enough rain in one day at Houston's Intercontinental Airport to set a record for the wettest 24-hour period in September, breaking Hurricane Ike's record set on September 13, 2008. However, flight operations for arrivals will resume at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) on Friday, as per airport authorities. "Flight arrivals will resume at 4 am CT tomorrow. Please check with your airline on flight status before coming to the airport. While driving to the airport will be closed until Noon. All other checkpoints will be open. United passengers, please use Cor E checkpoints," tweeted Houston Bush Airport.Meanwhile, the NRG Stadium where Modi is scheduled to address 50,000 people is unaffected by heavy rains as it has two retractable, fabric roofs. This means that the venue is well covered and dry.Taking cognizance of rains, American football team Texans has cancelled events in the stadium due to Imelda.However, the organisers are confident about the mega event and have said that the situation is normal."The tropical storm has passed and the weather is clearing up. Houston is dry and not flooded. Traffic is normal," Gitesh Desai, spokesperson of 'Howdy Modi' told ANI.The mega event is believed to be one of the largest events to welcome a foreign head of government ever in the history of the United States. The event will also be attended by President Donald Trump.In the United States, it will mark the first time that the two leaders would meet outside of either capital Washington DC or New York, where the United Nations is headquartered.Moreover, the fact that House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, will also address the gathering, further reflects the strong bipartisan support for the relationship between the two countries.

Reuters
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines recorded its second case of polio on Friday, as it prepared to vaccinate millions of children against a disease it believed to have been eradicated two decades ago. 
A five-year-old boy in Laguna, south of the capital Manila, tested positive for the polio virus, the health department said, the second case this week after a three-year-old girl was confirmed to be infected on Monday in a province about 1,400 km (870 miles) away.  
Health officials appealed to parents and care givers of children to take part in the government’s polio vaccination programme, which comes as the Philippines grapples to tackle twin outbreaks of dengue and measles that have killed more than 1,000 people since January, most of them children.   
“The polio vaccinations happen all year round, but our coverage dropped for the past five years,” Rolando Enrique Domingo, an undersecretary of the Department of Health, told Reuters. 
“We’ve learned our lesson. It is time to move on and really start vaccinating all kids and make sure we sustain this every year.” 
The polio virus was detected in the sewage systems of Davao in a nearby province two months ago, and in Tondo, a rundown area of Metro Manila notorious for slum communities, Domingo said. 
Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan are the last three countries where the disease is endemic. The last known case in the Philippines had been in 1993, the World Health Organization says. 
Graphic: here 
Immunisation coverage in the Philippines is at 70%, below the recommended rate of 95%, Domingo said, as trust in vaccines declines.   
The boy who tested positive in Laguna has been discharged from hospital already, officials said on Friday. The other case was confirmed on Monday and reported on Thursday in Lanao del Sur, one of the country’s poorest provinces. 
Vaccination teams will aim to administer polio drops to every child younger than five, he added.  
There is no cure for polio, which invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours, but it can be prevented with vaccines. 
The virus spreads rapidly among children, especially in unsanitary conditions in underdeveloped or war-torn regions where healthcare access is limited. 
Children nationwide are at risk as long as a single child remains infected, the United Nations agency for children, UNICEF, has said.  
The Philippines has faced a challenge recently in convincing parents to vaccinate children after it scrapped a dengue immunisation programme using Sanofi’s Dengvaxia in late 2017,  following its linkage to child deaths. 
More than 800,000 children received the vaccine. The records of 119 dead children are being examined to determine if Dengvaxia was to blame, a panel of medical experts said in March. 
The inquiry continues and Sanofi has repeatedly said its vaccine is safe. 
A vaccine campaign started in August in the historic heart of Manila will be expanded to cover more than 5 million children and go nationwide next year, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said in a speech on Friday.

ABQAIQ, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Friday took media on a tour of oil facilities damaged by attacks that Washington and Riyadh blame on Iran, showing melted pipes and burnt equipment, as Tehran vowed wide retaliation if heightened tensions boil over into hostilities. 
The kingdom sees the Sept. 14 strikes on its Khurais and Abqaiq facilities — the worst attack on Gulf oil infrastructure since Iraq’s Saddam Hussein torched Kuwaiti oilfields in 1991 — as a test of global will to preserve international order. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the United States was imposing sanctions on Iran’s central bank over the attack. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the bank was Tehran’s last source of funds. 
Asked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility. 
Iran denies involvement in the attack, which initially halved oil output from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest petroleum exporter. Responsibility was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen’s four-year-old conflict. 
At Abqaiq, one of the world’s largest oil processing plants, reporters saw a punctured, blackened stabilizer tower that Khalid Buraik, Saudi Aramco vice-president for southern area oil operations, said would have to be replaced. 
As reporters examined a shattered separator dome draped with a red tape labeled “Danger”, Buraik said 15 towers and facilities had been hit at Abqaiq, but it would regain full output capacity by the end of September. 
At Khurais oilfield to the west, which the Saudi defense ministry says was hit by four missiles, Reuters reporters were shown repair work under way, with cranes erected around two burnt-out stabilization columns, which form part of oil-gas separation units, and melted pipes.  
“We are confident we are going back to the full production we were at before the attack (on Khurais) by the end of September,” Fahad Abdulkarim, Aramco’s general manager for the southern area oil operation, told reporters. 
“We are working 24/7...This is a beehive.”  
Workmen wearing red high visibility jackets and white helmets moved through the site, a large compound the size of several football stadiums containing interconnected structures of piping and towers. 
A mound of blackened debris lay on the ground. An executive said the scorched mess once covered much of the surface of the facility but now only a small mound is left.  
Some workers sprayed what appeared to be water on the ground. Mobile cranes and water trucks stood near the crumpled, mangled remains of a fire-damaged stabilization tower.  
The Sept. 14 attacks intensified a years-long struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are locked in a sometimes violent contest for influence in several flashpoints around the Middle East. 
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Thursday the attacks were an “extension of the Iranian regime’s hostile and outlawed behavior”. 
Iran has warned the United States against being dragged into a war in the Middle East and said it would meet any offensive action with a crushing response. 
Tehran amplified that message on Friday when a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said Iran would respond from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean against any U.S. plots. 
“If the Americans think of any plots, the Iranian nation will respond from the Mediterranean, to the Red Sea and to the Indian Ocean,” said General Yahya Rahim-Safavi, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, state news agency IRNA reported.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In South America’s capital of romance, Argentine lovers are cutting back on one important cost: contraception. 
Amid a biting recession, a sharp currency devaluation and painful inflation, sales of condoms and birth control pills have tumbled, pharmacists and manufacturers say. 
“The devaluation of the peso is killing me,” actor and comic Guillermo Aquino jests in one viral video, in which a young man apologizes to a potential partner, saying he has only one condom left until the end of the year. 
“I love you, it’s not you, it’s the socio-economic situation,” adds the humorist. 
Underneath the comedy is a bleaker reality. 
South American’s No. 2 economy is expected to shrink 2.6% this year and is grappling with 50%-plus annual inflation. The peso currency has lost two thirds of its value against the dollar since the start of 2018, hammering imports and consumption. 
Domestic sales of cars, wines and meat have dipped as wallets have been squeezed. Industry sources estimated condom sales are down 8% since the start of the year compared to 2018, and have fallen by a quarter over recent months as the economic crisis has worsened. 
Most condoms, or the materials needed to make them, are imported, so a weaker currency has an immediate impact on the price, up some 36% since the start of the year, said Felipe Kopelowicz, president of Kopelco, manufacturer of Tulipán and Gentleman condom brands. 
Sales of birth control pill sales are also down - 6% for the year and by a fifth more recently, pharmacists said. 
Isabel Reinoso, president of the Argentina Pharmaceutical Confederation, told Reuters price rises meant thousands of women were going off the pill. “It’s around 144,000 women who have stopped taking contraceptives each month,” she said. 
Public health experts said the issue could aggravate levels of sexually transmitted disease. 
“When you’re just thinking about getting by day to day, health is often relegated and sexual health, which is still taboo and has little support, even more so,” said Mar Lucas, program director at Fundación Huésped, an Argentine non-profit organization fighting HIV. 
The government does distribute free condoms in public hospitals, but few know about it, she said. 
“We know they are rarely used, misused and used inconsistently. And so we keep having a lot of sexually transmitted infections,” added Lucas. 
Argentina’s Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. 
Emiliano Di Ilio, a pharmacist working in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, told Reuters that steep inflation had caused sales of condoms and contraceptive pills in his pharmacy to fall by 20% and 25% respectively in the last two months. 
“People come, ask the price, and then just leave,” he said.

Times Now
Los Angeles: Hollywood star Brad Pitt says he confronted Harvey Weinstein after the disgraced producer made unwanted advances towards his then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow because he wanted to protect her. In an interview with CNN, the 55-year-old discussed the incident Paltrow, 46, spoke about in a May 2018 interview with Howard Stern. At that moment, I was just a boy from the Ozarks on the playground and that's how we confronted things, Pitt said when asked what provoked him to confront the powerful producer.
"I just wanted to make sure nothing was going to happen further because she was going to do two films (with Weinstein). I think the interesting thing is that we, Hollywood specifically, but the workplace, men and women's dynamics is being re-calibrated, re-calibrated in a very good way that is long overdue. And I do think that's an important story to tell," he added.
Speaking to Stern, Paltrow had said she was "blindsided" by the alleged incident with Weinstein. "It was weird. I was alone in a room with him. It was out of the blue. I was shocked," she said. She told Pitt about what allegedly happened at the time, saying the actor confronted Weinstein and told him to never touch Paltrow again.
He said, "If you ever make her feel uncomfortable again, I'll kill you. Or something like that," Paltrow recalled Pitt saying to Weinstein. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex and retaliation against women for not entertaining his advances.

YourStory
When IIT Bombay batchmates and friends Siddharth Gadia and Girish Agarwal delved deeper into the unorganised pharma segment for their second startup idea, the duo discovered a problem - generics.

While significantly cheaper medicines with the same effects and composition were abundantly available, the end consumer wasn't getting the required benefits. 


This led to the birth of Generico. The duo opened their first store in Mulund, Mumbai in 2017. At present, it has over 41 stores. 

Siddharth Gadia and Girish Agarwal

But this wasn't their first rodeo. In 2015, Siddharth and Girish had launched Workcell, a B2B pharma platform that solved the retail issues plaguing the pharma industry on the B2B side. It acted as a discovery platform connecting pharmas to distributors.

The startup helped reduce the bounce rate of prescriptions, turning out to be quite a hit and by 2016, the duo had onboarded over 20,000 pharma companies. 

After graduating from IIT in 2009, Girish joined P&G. In 2011, he was bitten by the startup bug and founded GVS, a project management consulting firm for medium scale firm.


On the other hand, Siddharth was working in the metal refining space when he, too, realised that entrepreneurship was what he wanted to do. He founded Triptainment, a cloud tech platform that let people watch travel content without the internet. Soon, he also realised that it was a limited market. 

Eventually, the two decided to team up and started to brainstorm.


Thus came Workcell in 2015 followed by Generics in 2017. Girish explains that the two felt the need to shift their focus from B2B to B2C was because healthcare, as a segment, has the maximum impact on the end consumer.

“And that is where our focus needs to be,” he adds.

The duo chose the offline pharma route because they felt that pureplay tech wasn’t the answer. “The people who use most of the medicines for chronic illnesses aren’t mobile or tech first,” says Siddharth. 

The startup has built a network of retail outlets to create awareness and build the needed trust.

“We focussed on small store setups and began with three stores with a strong operating model,” Siddharth says. The stores, he adds, were in non-prime locations as the biggest challenge in going offline is managing rentals. 

But, there is some amount of tech, especially in reducing manual intervention. Generico has integrated with distributors and suppliers to make the ordering process simple. The team claims to be doing close to 200,000 transactions a month, and says it has made gross sales of over Rs 100 crore in two and a half years. 
Siddharth explains there is a significant push of branded generic medicines, which are primarily marketed by doctors. Hence, generics are largely neglected. He explains the market for traded generics is four to five percent of the $19 billion branded generic medicine. 


This, in turn, causes a large gap. Medicines take up a large chunk of all healthcare expenses and this was a space the co-founders believed needed strong attention. 

The startup raised Series A funding of $14 million led by Lightbox Ventures, Whiteboard Capital, an angel investor, and Tomorrow Capital. The team plans to use the funds towards expanding its retail footprint from 41 to 150 stores, enter more cites, build capabilities on the supply chain, technology, and data front.

Generico is also building a disease management solution for chronic patients.

On why Lightbox decided to invest in this pharma startup, Sandeep Murthy, Managing Partner at Lightbox Ventures, says,


Sandeep adds that Generico has been able to establish trust with its customers by knowing medicines and sourcing the right ones at the right time.

BGR India
OnePlus is set to launch the OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro on September 26. The smartphones will arrive as successors to OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro which were launched at the beginning of this year. Ahead of the launch, OnePlus has already confirmed that it is making 90Hz display standard on its flagships this year. The company showed the design which confirmed that it will have a circular rear camera module. Apart from design and display, OnePlus is also planning big changes to charging capabilities.
OnePlus has now announced that its next flagship smartphones will come equipped with Warp Charge 3T. It will apparently charge the devices at 23 percent faster speeds. “We believe that Warp Charge 30T offers the best charging solution for real-world usage. You can charge the phone at 23% faster speeds, even while using the device,” OnePlus CEO Pete Lau told TechRadar. The existing OnePlus 7 supports 20W fast charge while OnePlus 7 Pro supports 30W Warp Charge.
OnePlus 7T official renders confirm triple rear camera setup with circular camera bump
“We’re not going to introduce something for the sake of being first,” Lau said about new fast charging feature. “We took time to refine and iterate, continuously testing until we were able to achieve something we were proud to provide to our fans.”
OnePlus has also confirmed that users will be able to use the same 30W Warp Charge charging brick with their new phone. Lau also revealed that Warp Charge 30 handles the power management inside of the power brick instead of inside the phone. This allows the phone to remain cool even when the device is charging at a faster rate and even when it is in use. “Our latest Warp Charge delivers 6A at 5V to attain 30W,” Lau told TechRadar.
Even Apple has added fast charging to new iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. OnePlus’ rivals in the Android domain, mainly Huawei and Samsung, are also pushing the boundaries with fast charging. Huawei offers 40W wired charging while Samsung has added 45W fast wired charging. OnePlus is trying to perfect its 30W Warp Charge first introduced with McLaren Edition of OnePlus 6T last year.
OnePlus 7T to come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+: Report
OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro, like their predecessors, will not support wireless charging. Lau claims that wireless charging is still not fast enough to be added to the company’s devices. However, a lot of critics would like to differ with Lau in this regard. With Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro, Huawei has added 27W wireless charging. Xiaomi is working on 30W wireless charging, which will be as fast as wired charging.

Times Now
New Delhi: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday defended Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the wake of the all-round attack against him over several issues. A day after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi attacked PM Modi over his upcoming ‘Howdy, Modi’ community event in the United States, Tharoor said: “We should respect him as he is the Prime Minister of India”.
Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, tweeted today: “As an Opposition MP, I have the right to criticise @narendramodi’s policies, statements, actions & inaction, & expose his failures. But when he goes abroad, he is @PMOIndia & he carries my flag. I want him to be received & treated w/ the respect due to my country’s PrimeMinister. (sic)”
A little later, while speaking to reporters, Tharoor reiterated his views. “We disapprove of what Mr Modi says and does but when the Prime Minister of India is going abroad, we wish him well because he has to carry the flag of the nation outside the country,” Tharoor said.
“I don't want to say anything more critical of that. Inside the country, we have a lot of things to say against his policies and his mistakes which we believe are many. Outside the country, he is the Prime Minister of India, let us respect him,” the former Union minister added.
Tharoor’s sharp remarks came a day after Rahul Gandhi launched a sharp attack at PM Modi over his Houston event, asking about the state of the economy.
“’Howdy’ economy doin’, Mr Modi? Ain’t too good it seems,” Rahul tweeted on Thursday.
Even yesterday, Tharoor had said at an event that PM Modi should not be "criticised over everything". He, instead, pitched for engaging in constructive criticism.
Tharoor suggested that the Opposition should try to find out the “reasons” for his return.
“His percentage of votes shot up from 31 per cent to 37 per cent while our vote percentage went down. His policies such as Swachh Bharat Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana worked well for him. However, in reality, over 65 per cent of these toilets lack water. Here, we need to get into constructive criticism," he said.

The Quint
Hours after the arrest of BJP leader Swami Chinmayanand on Friday, 20 September, the woman who has accused him of rape said the police are trying to weaken the case against him.
“This has played out exactly as I feared... there is no justice,” said the woman.
But Uttar Pradesh police chief O P Singh said Chinmayanand has been arrested in connection with a case of rape, as reported by PTI.
"Yogiji is a good person, and all this was possible only due to him, she said, referring to the arrest. But I feel sad that the name of Swami Chinmayanand is linked with Yogi Adityanath. Chinmayanand is a rapist, and his name should not be associated with Yogi Adityanath, she said.
The woman who accused Chinmayanand, has been charged with an extortion case against him filed by Chinmayanand’s team, reported NDTV.
In a press release issued by the Special Investigation Team, the law student’s name featured as the fourth name among the accused as ‘Ms A’, reported The Hindu, but the police is yet to get clarity on whether her name was included in the extortion case FIR or explicitly named her as an accused.
The police is yet to recover the mobile phones of Sanjay Singh, the key accused in the extortion case and the law student.
Earlier in the day, Chinmayanand was arrested earlier from Shahjahanpur after a UP law student levelled rape charges against him, has been sent to 14 day judicial custody by a local court.
The UP Police SIT, in a press conference, said that Chinmayanand has admitted to almost every allegation levelled against him, including sexual conversations.

UP DGP OP Singh sought to counter criticisms that the SIT had been dragging its heels on the case, saying to ANI:
“On direction of the SC we had constituted an SIT team and after a probe we arrested Swami Chinmayanand from his ashram and he has been sent to jail. There has been no delay in the case. We have also arrested three people over extortion threats to Swami Chinmayanand.”
The DGP also stated that charges of rape have also been added to the complaint against the BJP leader (see video above at 1:17).
However, after local reporters questioned this, The Quint was able to confirm that no charges of rape have actually been added by the SIT.
The Quint accessed a report of the SIT which shows that, in addition to the original offences of kidnapping and criminal intimidation alleged by the survivor’s father, the SIT has added offences under Section 376C and Section 354D of the IPC.
Supreme Court advocate Vrinda Grover strongly criticised this move by the SIT, saying that this was a “very clear dilution of the offences and a weakening of the case.”
Section 376C of the IPC deals with sexual intercourse by a position in authority, which does not amount to rape. It is punishable with rigorous imprisonment of five to ten years.
According to Grover, the correct provisions of law that were attracted in this case were under Section 376(2) of the IPC, which deals with ‘aggravated rape’, and is punishable with at least ten years’ life imprisonment, if not life imprisonment. Specifically, she said the complaint disclosed offences under sub-clauses
Grover was of the view that the failure to add Section 376(2) to the FIR showed that there “is a very, very clear dilution of the offences and a weakening of the case.” She pointed out that this provision is more serious as
“has a corresponding section in the Indian Evidence Act. These aggravated rapes are circumstances where the rape is committed in a situation where the woman is in a coercive circumstance. And therefore, you cannot plead consent. The presumption shifts to the accused if the woman says that she did not consent and that sexual intercourse is proved.”
She therefore believes this constitutes a “clear effort to shield the accused”.
The Quint tried to contact DGP OP Singh for a response, but he was unavailable for comment.
Pooja Singh, the lawyer representing Chinmayanand told ANI that the BJP leader was arrested from his residence, when his health was critical. He was under the observation of doctors when the police arrived, she added, saying that she was not allowed to meet him.
He has been taken for medical examination to a government hospital, she said.
Singh said the SIT took signatures of Chinmayanand's relatives on the arrest memo but no arrest-related documents, including a copy of the FIR, were given to them.
As Chinmayanand was taken to the hospital for medical check-up, patients had to face a tough time as they were not allowed to enter the premises, according to PTI.
Teams led by senior police officials have been deployed at the court premises and the hospital. A team of police officials is also patrolling the area to ensure there is no disturbance, a senior official said.
Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said the government took action against Chinmayanand only after the woman, who accused him of rape, threatened self-immolation.
Taking to Twitter, she said it was the strength of the public and journalism that Chinmayanand had to be arrested.
"The BJP government is so thick skinned that it did not take action till the rape survivor said that she will self immolate herself. This is the strength of the public and of journalism that the SIT had to arrest Chinmayanand," she said.
"The public has ensured that 'Beti Bachao' does not remain in mere slogans but becomes a reality on the ground," she added.
The 23-year-old woman, a student at a law college that Chinmayanand runs, has alleged that Chinmayanand sexually exploited her for a year after helping her with admission into his college.
Inspector General Naveen Arora, who heads the SIT, said a mobile phone and a pen drive given by the student have been sent for forensic examination.
The pen drive contains 43 video clips which the student says support her allegations, PTI reported.
Police has registered a case of criminal intimidation and abduction against Chinmayanand on a complaint lodged by the woman's father. Later, the student also accused him of rape and "physical exploitation".

Chinmayanand, who was admitted to the medical college in Shahjahanpur on Wednesday, was referred to King George's Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow.
But he chose to return to his residence on Thursday and get ayurvedic treatment there, according to his counsel Om Singh.
He underwent several tests at the Shahjahanpur hospital where a team of four doctors monitored his condition, a spokesperson told PTI.
The student had earlier threatened self-immolation if the police do not arrest him.

New York: India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Syed Akbaruddin, on Thursday took a swipe at Pakistan on their continued insistence that the Kashmir topic is raised at the UN, and said: “...Poisoned pens do not work for too long”.
“There may be someone who wants to bring an issue which they have raised before. It is for every country to determine its trajectory, how it wants to approach global platforms. There may be some who stoop low, our response then is we soar high,” Akbaruddin said during a media briefing in New York.
The UN representative was interacting with reporters and was responding to a question on the Kashmir issue being raised by Pakistan at the United Nations.
Syed Akbaruddin: There may be some who stoop low.Our response to them is we soar high.They may stoop low, we soar high. What they want to do is their call. We’ve seen them mainstream terrorism in the past. And what you’re now telling me is they may want to mainstream hate speech. https://t.co/md4XACVznb
“We have seen them, their mainstream terrorism in the past...and what you are telling me now, that they may want to mainstream hate speech, it is their call if they want to do that. Poisoned pens don’t work for too long. We are confident that we will soar. We have given you examples of how we will not stoop that low,” he said, news agency ANI reported.
He also said that India would want the international community to take action in unison to combat the issue of terrorism.
“Terrorism will always be a key theme in India’s external orientation because Indians have suffered enough and we would like the international community to act in unison to address these issues,” he said.

Reuters
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is poised to pass a new penal code that criminalizes consensual sex outside marriage and introduces stiff penalties for insulting the president’s dignity - a move rights groups  criticized as an intrusive assault on basic freedoms. 
Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim majority country and has substantial Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities, but has seen a recent trend towards deeper religious piety and conservative Islamic activism. 
The new criminal code is due to be adopted in the next week after parliament and the government agreed a final draft on Wednesday, four parliamentarians told Reuters. 
Lawmakers told Reuters that the new penal code, which would replace a Dutch colonial-era set of laws, was a long overdue expression of Indonesian independence and religiosity.     
“The state must protect citizens from behavior that is contrary to the supreme precepts of God,” said Nasir Djamil, a politician from the Prosperous Justice Party. He said leaders of all religions had been consulted on the changes given that Indonesia’s founding ideology was based on belief in God.  
Under the proposed laws, unmarried couples who “live together as a husband and wife” could be jailed for six months or face a maximum fine of 10 million rupiah ($710), which is three months’ salary for many Indonesians.  
A prosecution can proceed if a village chief, who heads the lowest tier of government, files a complaint with police, and parents or children of the accused do not object. Parents, children and spouses can also lodge a complaint. 
The inclusion of the new power for village chiefs was warranted because “the victim of adultery is also society”, another lawmaker, Teuku Taufiqulhadi, said. 
The Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, an NGO, said millions of Indonesians could be ensnared by the new laws. It noted a study indicating that 40 per cent of Indonesian adolescents engaged in pre-marital sexual activity. 
“Across the board, this is a ratcheting up of conservatism. It’s extremely regressive,” said Tim Lindsey, director of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Indonesian Law, Islam and Society. 
A maximum one-year prison term also can be applied to a person who has sex with someone who is not their spouse and a close family member lodges a complaint. The law also impacts homosexuals as gay marriage is not recognized in Indonesia. 
The code also establishes prison terms for those found to commit “obscene acts”, defined as violating norms of decency and politeness through “lust or sexuality”, whether by heterosexuals or gay people. 
The new laws will also apply to foreigners. However, asked whether tourists in Indonesia could face jail for extramarital sex, Taufiqulhadi said: “No problem, as long as people don’t know.” 
There would also be a maximum four-year prison term for women who have an abortion, applicable if there was no medical emergency or rape involved. The code further introduces fines for some people who promote contraception, and a six-month prison term for unauthorized discussion of “tools of abortion”. 
In addition, local authorities would get greater freedom to introduce punishments for breaches of customary laws not covered in the penal code. There are more than 400 local regulations that activists say impinge civil rights, such as the mandatory wearing of a hijab, an Islamic headscarf for women. 
Meanwhile, parliament has reintroduced the offence of “attacking the honor or dignity” of Indonesia’s president and vice president. A similar law was struck down by the Constitutional Court in 2006, and the new version is likely to be challenged by rights activists as well. 
Insulting the government and state institutions also carries a prison term.

But, I will continue my struggle in the US," Ismail told Mashaal Radio.In a country like Pakistan, where criticism of the military is frowned upon, Ismail campaigned vigorously for women's rights, bringing attention to rapes, disappearances and other abuses that she and many others say have been committed by the country's security forces.Ismail became a fugitive in May in her country, soon after she posted accusations on social media against Pakistani soldiers. In her posts on Facebook and Twitter, she had accused soldiers of raping and sexually abusing Pakistani women on her Facebook and Twitter pages in January this year.The woman right activist also took part in the ethnic Pashtun movement. The movement headed by Manzoor Pashteen has now become another headache for the Pakistani Army, whose heavy-handed techniques to crush the movement has failed miserably."There are misconceptions about Pashtuns in America that needs to be fixed. From there, I will be fighting and the world will know that Pashtuns are the victims of war," said Ismail.Human rights defenders believe that the charges of treason against her were false and that she was being targeted for pointing out the blatant abuses committed by the Pakistani military.Ismail has been barred by the Pakistani government from leaving the country.In November last year, Pakistan-based media outlet Dawn reported that the Islamabad High Court was informed that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had recommended putting Ismail's name on the Exit Control List (ECL) for her alleged anti-state activities abroad.However, the court had ordered the removal of her name from the list following a petition by Ismail challenging the government's decision to put her name on the ECL. But, the court allowed the interior ministry to take appropriate action, including confiscation of her passport, in the light of recommendations made by ISI. (ANI)

After Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday announced fresh measures to boost economy, industry leaders reacted with a thumbs up. The announcements made by the government today would have big impact on the economy and revive the economy’s animal spirits, said Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC. The lower tax rates would attract more international manufacturing companies as now we would be comparable to the global companies in terms of tax rates, he added. Sharing his views, Uday Kotak, MD, Kotak Mahindra Bank said that the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent is a big bang reform.
Reducing corporate tax rate to 25% is big bang reform. Allows Indian companies to compete with lower tax jurisdictions like the U.S. It signals that our government is committed to economic growth and supports legitimate tax abiding companies.A bold, progressive step forward.
— Uday Kotak (@udaykotak) September 20, 2019

Among the major decisions, the finance minister announced lowering corporate tax rate and relief on capital gains for FPIs. To provide relief to companies which continue to avail exemptions and incentives, rate of MAT has been reduced from existing 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent.

The Financial Express
Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said the government took action against former Union minister Swami Chinmayanand only after the woman, who accused him of rape, threatened self immolation. Taking to twitter, she said it was the strength of the public and journalism that Chinmayanand had to arrested.
“The BJP government is so thick skinned that it did not take action till the rape victim said that she will self immolate herself. This is the strength of the public and of journalism that the SIT had to arrest Chinmayanand,” she said. “The public has ensured that ‘Beti Bachao’ does not remain in mere slogans but becomes a reality on the ground,” she added.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Swami Chakrapani of Hindu Maha Sabha said on Thursday that if the verdict in the Ramjanambhoomi-Babri Masjid case comes in favour of Hindus, then a grand temple of Lord Ram will be built using gold in Ayodhya.
"As soon as in the first week of November verdict comes in favour of Hindu Maha Sabha and Hindus we have decided to build a grand temple of Lord Ram made not of stones and bricks but of Gold," said Swami Chakrapani
"The Sanatan Dharmi Hindus of not only in India but from all over the world will contribute in building a grand temple of Lord Rama made up of gold," he said.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that arguments in Ramjanambhoomi-Babri Masjid case have to be completed by October 18 even as the mediation panel may continue its work under confidentiality.
"As per the estimate of tentative dates to finish the hearing in the case, we can say that the submissions have to be likely completed by October 18," said the CJI Ranjan Gogoi, who heads the five-judge constitution bench hearing the case. He is set to demit office on November 17.
The mediation panel can submit a report whatever be the outcome of it after the process, the court had observed. The mediation panel report will be submitted by Justice (Retd) FMI Khalifullah-led three-member panel to the Apex Court in a sealed cover.

The top court is hearing a batch of petitions filed by, Hindu and Muslim and others sides, challenging the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, which divided the disputed site into three equal parts.
The day-to-day hearing started on August 6 after a court-appointed mediation panel failed to resolve the dispute through amicable settlement.

The New Indian Express
LUCKNOW: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has praised Air India for its proposal to serve its crew cost-effective low-fat meals in an attempt to tackle its financial crisis.
PETA India has sent a letter to the Air India Chairman and Managing Director, Ashwani Lohani, urging him to introduce a policy of serving vegan meals to all crew members as well as passengers on all domestic and international flights.
PETA India has said that such a move would support the government's Eat Right India initiative, cut costs and help animals and the planet.

The letter sent by Kiran Ahuja, vegan Outreach Coordinator of PETA India, said that the initiative fits perfectly with the government campaign and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Fit India Movement.
"The healthiest, most cost-effective meals that are also good for animals and the planet are vegan (that is, entirely plant-based). We suggest you bring down your costs, promote healthy eating, reduce Air India's carbon footprint, and protect animals by serving crew and passengers only delicious vegan meals on all your flights," the letter says.
The letter further points out that meat, milk, cheese, and eggs are expensive, whereas some of the most versatile vegan foods, including beans, rice, pasta, vegetables, and fruit, cost relatively less in comparison. Consuming meat, eggs, and dairy increases the risk of suffering from ailments such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer.

"Indeed, India is the 'diabetes capital of the world', and heart disease is the leading cause of death here. The United Nations estimated that non-communicable diseases, which are largely caused by the consumption of meat and other animal-derived foods, would cost India's economy more than US $ 6 trillion between 2012 and 2030," the letter said.
ALSO READ: ‘Cube of Truth’ held to create awareness on veganism

Research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded that "the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meat eaters".
Another study found that 'vegan diets showed statistically significant protection for overall cancer incidence in both genders combined and for female-specific cancers' and that vegetarians seemed to have a reduced risk of suffering from cancers of the gastrointestinal system.
Regarding diabetes, a study of over 40,000 people published in Nutrition, Metabolism & Cardiovascular Diseases concluded that vegetarian diets "were associated with a substantial and independent reduction in diabetes incidence".
The PETA coordinator further said: "Air India already serves only vegetarian meals on domestic flights and will soon end its use of plastic, but your company, your employees, your passengers, the environment, and animals would benefit hugely if you went one step further. We would be happy to assist with menu-planning."

Livemint

New Delhi: Two of the most sought after features in Apple Watches since Series 4 have been the ability to take ECG (electrocardiogram) readings using the ECG app and get irregular heart rhythm notification. Meant to help users detect signs of AFib (atrial fibrillation), the two new options are finally available to users in India with an update to watch OS 6. First announced in September 2018, the two options were released only in US in December 2018, after clearance by the US' FDA ( Food & Drug Administration).
For ECG readings, user has to touch and hold the digital crown, to allow the electrodes built into it along with the ones built on the back of the Watch to complete a circuit and measure the electrical signals passing across the heart. With the ECG app, users can take readings anytime they want or after an irregular rhythm notification, which is calculated by frequently checking the heart rhythm in the background via the optical heart sensor on the back.
If the Watch detects Afibs repeatedly even after five rhythm checks in a time span of 65 minutes, a notification is automatically sent to the user.
All ECG readings, their classification and highlighted symptoms are safely tucked away in the Health app on the iPhone with the option to convert and send them as PDF files to physicians.
The ECG app takes 30 seconds to take a reading and identify a heart rhythm as AFib, sinus rhythm or inconclusive.
The app's ability to accurately identify an ECG recording into AFib or sinus rhythm was backed by a clinical trial involving 600 people, while irregular rhythm notification feature was recently studied in the Apple Heart Study. A part of that data was presented before the FDA for approval.

Apple has barely released iOS 13, but you might be getting another significant revision mere days later.  The company has told Engadget it's moving the releases of iPadOS and iOS 13.1 to September 24th, or nearly a week before the originally scheduled September 30th debut.  While there's no mention of just why Apple is stepping up the pace, it might be due to software stability.  Some iPhone 11 reviewers (including Engadget) have noticed buggy behavior in iOS 13.0, and this could iron out the kinks before there's been too much opportunity to complain.
You will get some new features in return.  iPadOS, as you may know, is a major shake-up that introduces more iPad-specific features, such as better multitasking and a widget view on the home screen.  The iOS 13.1 update mainly adds features that didn't make the cut for 13.0, including ETA sharing in Maps, automated Siri Shortcut actions and data separation for enterprise devices.  This definitely isn't a seamless release, then, but you at least shouldn't have to wait long to see new features and a smoother overall experience.

A few days ago, Disney chief Bob Iger resigned from Apple's board of directors ahead of TV+'s launch in November -- the House of Mouse, after all, is launching its own streaming service in the same month. Things may have been much different if Steve Jobs were still alive, though, because Iger believes a Disney-Apple merger would have happened (or at least seriously considered) under their leadership. Iger revealed his thoughts in a Vanity Fair article adapted from his upcoming autobiography.
Iger talked about his friendship with Jobs in the piece, telling the story of how Disney managed to acquire Pixar happened even though Jobs held a "deep-rooted" animosity toward Disney at the time. He also talked about they discussed the future of TV before the iPhone's release and how he told Jobs that he envisioned an iTunes-like platform for television.
"With every success the company has had since Steve's death, there's always a moment in the midst of my excitement when I think, I wish Steve could be here for this... I believe that if Steve were still alive, we would have combined our companies, or at least discussed the possibility very seriously," he wrote.
Iger didn't say why he chose to focus on his relationship with Jobs and Apple for his Vanity Fair piece. It may simply be one of the most compelling parts of his book, but it makes one wonder if it's because he's currently trying to make a Disney-Apple merger happen. As CNBC notes, though, an acquisition likely wouldn't get approved now that authorities have become more conscious of how big-tech mergers are being viewed as anti-competitive. The companies are much too large at this point, with Apple valued at $1 trillion and Disney at $300 billion.

The Financial Express
The Trinamool Congress has criticised West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar for visiting the Jadavpur University without taking the state government in confidence after BJP leader and Union minister Babul Supriyo was allegedly heckled by a section of students. The TMC termed the Governor’s visit unfortunate and added that even Supriyo went to the university without informing the administration.
Party general secretary and Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said that the Governor went to Jadavpur University despite requests by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to not go there. Chatterjee said that she had urged Dhankar to give the government time to control the situation.
“This is most unfortunate and shocking that our Governor, the custodian of the Constitution of the State, without informing the elected government, went to the so-called rescue of the BJP leader from Jadavpur University. BJP leader Babul Supriyo went there to attend the BJP students’ wing program without informing the government even,” he said in a statement on Thursday night, news agency ANI reported.
The TMC’s reaction came hours after Supriyo was heckled and shown black flags by students at Jadavpur University on Thursday evening. The BJP leader was also stopped by the students from leaving the university campus, prompting Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to rush to the varsity with a large police force.
Supriyo had gone to the university to attend an event organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
Chatterjee said that the police was waiting outside the varsity, but couldn’t enter the campus as there was no communication from the vice-chancellor. When the Governor was on his way, the TMC leader said, he rang up the CM. Banerjee requested him several times to wait and not go there.
Reacting to the Governor’s statement wherein he questioned the law and order situation in the state, Chatterjee asked why the Governor did not speak on the vandalism allegedly perpetrated by the BJP and ABVP in the Jadavpur University campus on Thursday.
“We strongly oppose his political views,” he said. The leader clarified that neither the TMC students’ wing nor the police were involved in the violence at the JU and added that it was between the Left students’ union and the BJP.

Airbnb has put to rest speculation about the timing of its IPO. The vacation rental company today took the rare step of announcing in a press release that it plans to go public next year, in 2020. The startup, which first launched in 2008, has grown to become a $30 billion company, with more listings than the eight largest hotel groups in the world, combined.
The company yesterday published an optimistic update on its future. "As our community has grown, our business has thrived. In the second quarter of 2019, Airbnb recognized substantially more than $1 billion in revenue. The second quarter of 2019 marked the second quarter in our history in which Airbnb revenue exceeded $1 billion."
The initial plan was for Airbnb to go public as soon as this year, along with Uber and Lyft. But back in March, company co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk cast doubt on such a plan. "We have already said that we are taking the steps to be ready to go public in 2019. That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019," said Blecharczyk in an interview with Business Insider.
As a publicly traded company, Airbnb still may have an uncertain trajectory ahead. Lower than expected market debuts for Lyft and Uber may lower the confidence of investors. WeWork, another Silicon Valley startup that aimed to go public this year, postponed plans after being unable to secure enough funding.
But unlike other startups, Airbnb has turned a profit. The company said revenue topped $1 billion in the second quarter of 2019, the second time it has done so. It also acquired both HotelTonight and travel company Urbandoor this year. Still, regulatory pushbacks from cities all over the world and concerns over quality control may lead to future setbacks.

The Food and Drug Administration opened a criminal investigation into the vaping supply chain earlier this summer, it has emerged. The Office of Criminal Investigations started the probe following reports of a vaping-related lung illness. The agency now says more than 530 people have been affected, and seven deaths have been attributed to the illness thus far.
Officials suspect a type of chemical exposure is to blame, but the cause of the illness has not yet been verified. Symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea. All of the cases are linked to vaping or e-cigarette use. Some affected people used e-cigarette products with THC, while others used nicotine ones or those with both THC and nicotine. Some people used black market products.
The agency isn't targeting individuals for their personal use of controlled substances through the investigation, according to Mitch Zeller, the director of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. The probe extends across several states, hundreds of cases and a broad range of products and substances, Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director, told reporters on a conference call.
News of the investigation comes amid a regulatory crackdown on vaping and e-cigarettes in the US and elsewhere. The federal government plans to ban non-tobacco-flavored e-cigs while New York and Michigan have already blocked sales of them. Chinese retailers stopped sales of Juul products this week, while India has effectively banned e-cigarettes.

Reuters
(Reuters) - Two shootings in Washington, D.C. left two people dead and seven injured late on Thursday, reports by police and several media outlets said, as authorities on Friday hunted for a pair of suspects from one of the attacks likely armed with an assault rifle.     
In the first attack, one man was killed and five people wounded, two of them critically, in a drive-by shooting. The victims had been standing in an apartment building courtyard in the Columbia Heights neighborhood when they were shot, Metropolitan Police commander Stuart Emerman said. 
Two suspects were seen in a Nissan sedan and used an “AK style rifle,” police said in statement.  
“Detectives are interviewing witnesses and looking for camera footage,” Emerman said. 
About half an hour after the first incident, three people were shot in the northeastern part of the city, leaving one dead, according to NBC’s Washington affiliate. There was no initial indication the two shootings were linked, NBC reported, citing police. 
DC Police on Twitter confirmed the second shooting in the 1400 block of Rhode Island Avenue just south of the Brookland neighborhood but gave no other details.    
ABC affiliate WJLA-TV showed ambulances carrying victims from the scene of the first shooting.  
Gun violence has been a regular feature of American life, but a spate of recent mass shootings in Texas, Ohio and other states have renewed debate over the nation’s gun laws and spurred calls for action.  
Many Republicans and the powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, oppose further restrictions on gun ownership.    Republican Vice President Mike Pence has decried the gun-control stance and accused the Democrats as having a “radical agenda.” 
Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Thursday, said he was looking for compromise steps that both Democrats and Republicans could support on gun control, but has given no details on what action he may push.  
House Democrats have passed several gun initiatives, including expanded background checks, but the Republican-led Senate has not taken up the legislation.  
The controversy over the use of assault rifles has entered the 2020 presidential race, with candidate and former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke declaring at a Democratic debate that he would confiscate such rifles. 
O’Rourke has made gun safety the centerpiece of his campaign since late August, when his hometown of El Paso, Texas, was the site of a racially motivated mass shooting that killed 22 people inside a Walmart store. 
On Thursday, gunmaker Colt said it was suspending its productions of the AR15 and other rifles for the civilian market, the Associated Press reported.

Times Now
Bollywood actor Akshaye Khanna recently starred in Section 375: Marzi Ya Zabardasti. The actor, who has almost always been in the news for his work commitments and films, has rarely ever opened up about his personal life. 
However, in a recent interview, the actor bared his heart about getting married and having kids. Sharing that he doesn't think he is "marriage material", Akshaye explained why he believes that is not a cut out for marriage and having kids. 
The actor was also asked if he will ever adopt kids. To which, Akshaye simply explained that whether it's getting married or having kids, both these things can drastically change one's life. He shared how he doesn't want to go through it all and ruled out the possibility of marriage and kids adding that he is not someone who wants to share his life. 
The actor was quoted as saying, "I’m not cut out for that life; for sharing my life. Whether it’s getting married, or having kids. That too drastically changes your life. Everything important to you becomes less important, because the child gains utmost importance. That kind of changes life… and those kind of alterations that you have to make in your life are not the things I want to do. I’m not willing to give up.

Football star Cristiano Ronaldo in his recent interview with Piers Morgan revealed about his humble background and how he and his friends begged for free burgers from McDonald's when they were 11.
"We were hungry. We had a McDonald's next to the stadium. We would always also go to the back door and knock and ask if they had any burgers left," Ronaldo told Morgan.
Ronaldo said that he wanted to find 'Edna' and the two other girls and wished to invite them for dinner.
"There was always Edna and two other girls. I never found them again. I asked people in Portugal, they closed the McDonalds, but if this interview can help find them, I would be so happy.
"I want to invite them to Turin or Lisbon to come to have dinner with me because I want to give something back."
Morgan later tweeted to say that there could soon be a reunion. "UPDATE: We may have found Edna..."
During the course of the interview, Ronaldo was also reduced to tears when he revealed he was left feeling embarrassed and isolated after rape allegations were levelled against him.
Ronaldo also bragged about owning 17 cars and having "good money in the bank".
He also rued the fact that his father, who died when the star footballer was just 20, never got to enjoy his success.

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Seventeen-year-old striker Mason Greenwood scored his first senior Manchester United goal and saved his side’s blushes in a 1-0 win over Kazakhstan’s Astana in their Europa League Group L opener at Old Trafford on Thursday. 
The prodigy slotted home through the keeper’s legs at the near post in the 73rd minute to make history in only his second start as the first player born in the 2000s to score a senior goal for the club. 
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s youthful line-up had earlier struggled to dominate their weakest opponents in the group despite having plenty of possession. 
United made nine changes to the side that started against Leicester City in the Premier League last weekend, with Nemanja Matic taking the captain’s role in the absence of Ashley Young and goalkeeper David De Gea. 
They came close to scoring after three minutes when Fred’s powerful long-distance strike from smacked off the top of the crossbar. 
Marcus Rashford missed another great chance 10 minutes later with a close-range shot straight at the goalkeeper. 
“We made it hard for ourselves,” said Solskjaer, relieved at least to be leading Group L after Partizan Belgrade and AZ Alkmaar drew 2-2 in Serbia. 
“It’s pleasing, though, that we got three points, got off to a decent start. 
“In and around the box he (Greenwood) is one of the best finishers we’ve got and I’m happy he got his goal. I’m sure he’ll go home tonight and be happy with that one.” 
While he partnered 21-year-old regular Rashford up front, teenagers Angel Gomes and Tahith Chong made their full debuts before being replaced by Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard respectively. 
Lingard hit the post in the 80th minute and Diogo Dalot missed a sitter in front of 50,000 fans as United raised the tempo after going ahead but still looked short of creativity. 
“It was a hard game. First half we tried to open the game and to score a fast goal but they had a solid defence,” Matic told BT Sport. 
“It’s good for the (young players) to have the opportunity to play these games. They have to use that, to work hard to get more chances.”

Former Team India trainer Shankar Basu has made a return to Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) as he has been appointed as the strength and conditioning coach of the franchise for the upcoming season of Indian Premier League (IPL).
During his stint with the national team, Basu was also the director of Primal Patterns Holistic Fitness Studio — a private chain of gyms that specializes in strength and conditioning training apart from providing personal training to fitness enthusiasts and physiotherapy treatment. This led to questions of ‘conflict of interest’ against the coach.
Primal Patterns Holistic Fitness Studio was earlier in the news when Soham Desai was recruited as one of the new trainers at the National Cricket Academy. For those unaware, Desai was a part of Primal Patterns and his recruitment had seen BCCI treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry question the process followed and it had first been said that Desai had passed the test in which Basu himself had set the question paper, but subsequently it came to light that Desai had not even taken the test in the first place.
Apart from Basu, Adam Griffith has been appointed the bowling coach, Sridharan Sriram has been named the batting and spin bowling coach, Evan Speechly has been appointed the physio, Malolan Rangarajanhas been named head of scouting and Soumyadeep Pyne has been recruited as the team manager.
Earlier, RCB had announced Mike Hesson as the director of cricket operations and Simon Katich as the head coach.

Tiger Global is making back to back investments in the Indian startup ecosystem. The New York-based investor kicked off the funding spree in October 2018 after three-year hiatus, and since then, it has picked up around 20 startups under its portfolio.
After the initial focus on B2B startups, Tiger Global’s investment across consumer internet and enterprise has also grown considerably. In overall 20 deals, the number of investments in B2C startups has now reached 10.
The hedge fund has mainly been aggressive on fintech space. It backed Fyle, Open Financial, OkCredit in B2B segment while INDWealth and CRED are its B2C bets. Adding Upstox in its portfolio, the firm has invested $25 million in the online stock broking company. 
Backed by the likes of Kalaari Capital and individual investors Ratan Tata, Upstox had raised around $4 million in last institutional round in 2016.
The eleven-year-old company allows retail investors to trade in the equity market through the platform. Besides stockbroking, it is planning to add mutual fund investments as well.
According to Ravi Kumar, cofounder, Upstox, the company has been profitable for the last couple of years and will infuse the risk capital for expanding the business, strengthening product platform and double the team size to 300.
As of now, the platform claims to have around 300,000 clients and contribute over 3% of the national trades conducted across exchanges in India.
Upstox had recently tied up with Mumbai-based robo-advisory firm Tavaga Advisory Services to tap tech-savvy youngsters and consumers in tier II and tier III cities.
The company directly competes with Zerodha, Angel Broking and ShareKhan.
The development was reported by ET.

Reuters
TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia’s Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, whose overthrow in a 2011 uprising triggered the “Arab Spring” revolutions, died in exile in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, days after a free presidential vote in his homeland.  
His funeral will take place on Friday in Saudi Arabia, his family lawyer, Mounir Ben Salha, told Reuters. 
“It is the end of dictators like him. We cannot forget that he destroyed our country ... he gave orders to kill civilians in protests in 2011,” said Imad Layouni, an unemployed 26-year-old in a Tunis coffee shop.  
Ben Ali fled Tunisia in January 2011 as his compatriots - many of them angered after a vegetable seller set himself on fire a few weeks earlier in protest at the police - rose up against his oppressive rule in a revolution that inspired other uprisings in the Middle East and led to a democratic transition at home.  
On Sunday, they voted in an election that featured candidates from across the political spectrum, sending two political outsiders through to a second round vote unthinkable during Ben Ali’s two decades in power. 
However, while Tunisians have enjoyed a much smoother march to democracy than citizens of the other Arab states that also rose up in 2011, many of them are economically worse off than they were under Ben Ali.  
While almost all the candidates in Sunday’s election were vocal champions of the revolution, one of them, Abir Moussi, campaigned as a supporter of Ben Ali’s ousted government, receiving 4% of the votes.  
“It is a sign of the intolerance in country, which claims to be a democracy, that he died in Saudi Arabia,” said Salwa Riahi, a doctor in Tunis.  
A former security chief, Ben Ali had run Tunisia for 23 years, taking power when, as prime minister in 1987, he declared president-for-life Habib Bourguiba medically unfit to rule.  
In office, he sought to stifle any form of political dissent while opening up the economy, a policy that led to rapid growth but also fuelled grotesque inequality and accusations of brazen corruption, not least among his own relatives.  
During that era, his photograph was displayed in every shop, school and government office from the beach resorts of the Mediterranean coast to the impoverished villages and mining towns of Tunisia’s hilly interior.  
On the few occasions his rule was put to the vote, he faced only nominal opposition and won re-election by more than 99%.  
On Sunday, by contrast Tunisians chose between 26 candidates including both Ben Ali’s own former supporter Moussi and an ex-political prisoner running for the Islamist Ennahda party, which he banned.  
Ben Ali’s rise began in the army after Bourguiba won Tunisia’s independence from France in 1956. He was head of military security from 1964, and of national security from 1977.  
After a three-year stint as ambassador to Poland, he was called back to his old security job in 1984 to quell riots over bread prices. Now a general, he was made interior minister in 1986 and prime minister in 1987.  
It took him less than three weeks to arrange a new promotion to the top job, bringing in a team of doctors to declare Bourguiba senile, meaning he would automatically take over as head of state.  
His first decade as president involved a big economic restructuring - backed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank - and an annual growth rate slightly over 4% a year.   
Wedged between Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya and an Algeria thrust into civil war between the army-backed government and Islamist militants, Ben Ali’s Tunisia followed the post-independence path of secularism and openness to the outside.  
But within, critics said it was a police state where few dared challenge an all-powerful government. In a country where many had experienced life under democracy elsewhere, Ben Ali’s oppressive state was reason to chafe.  
Meanwhile, the elite were accumulating wealth in their extravagant seaside villas. The lavish lifestyle of Ben Ali’s wife, Leila Trabelsi, and her clique of rich relatives, came to symbolise the corruption of an era.  
Out in the provinces, in the shabby towns of the south and the rural villages without running water, anger was growing, leading to a small protest movement in 2008, sometimes called “the little revolution”. 
Eight years on from the real uprising, life is still tough in those areas, with unemployment higher than in 2010 and public services seeming to have deteriorated.  
Tunisians often complain that living standards have dropped since the revolution, and speak of life under Ben Ali as more materially comfortable. But few speak with nostalgia of his style of rule, or say they want an end to democracy.  
For Ben Ali, the sudden end came when a desperate vegetable seller in the humble town of Sidi Bouzid set himself alight in December 2010 after police confiscated his barrow.  
Mohammed Bouazizi’s funeral was attended by tens of thousands of furious people, sparking weeks of ever bigger protests in which scores of people were killed.  
By mid January 2011, Ben Ali had had enough, and boarded a plane for Saudi Arabia. 
A Tunisian court sentenced him in absentia later that year to 35 years in prison. He never appeared in public again.

Washington [USA], Sept 19 (Sputnik/ANI): The United States will return around USD 100 million which was sanctioned for an Afghan energy project to the Treasury and withhold another USD 60 million in aid after concluding that Kabul is mismanaging resources, as per the US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo."Due to identified Afghan Government corruption and financial mismanagement, the US Government is returning approximately $100 million to the US Treasury that was intended for a large energy infrastructure project," Pompeo said on Thursday, Sputnik reported.Pompeo also expressed great concern over a "lack of transparency" in the Afghan National Procurement Authority's decisions, and said the US would withhold USD 60 million in planned assistance over its "failure to meet benchmarks for transparency and accountability".The United States will also cease all funding for the Afghan government's Monitoring and Evaluation Committee by the end of the year after determining that it is "incapable of being a partner in the international effort to build a better future for the Afghan people," Pompeo said.

		             NEW DELHI :
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is having a rethink two years after it decided to phase out interconnect usage charges (IUC) from January 2020.
The regulator on Wednesday floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic. The paper also seeks to discuss with stakeholders what parameters should be looked at to decide on an alternate date, if any.
IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. Scrapping the IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. The latest decision may come as a relief for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
“At present, there is a net outgo of calls from Jio to incumbents. If this IUC of six paise is retained a bit longer, it will offer incumbents some relief. This relief is due to them (Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea) as these companies acquired customers at a very high cost earlier. To equate them with a new player is unreasonable and to scrap IUC is over-zealous," said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to six paise per minute from 1 October 2017 from 14 paise earlier and an end to it from 1 January 2020. Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016, were hit hard by the order. At the time Trai decided to scrap IUC, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had resisted the change, while Jio was in favour.

The New Indian Express
MOHALI: Virat Kohli, who rode the Men in Blue to a commanding win over South Africa in the second T20I, has won high praise from his team-mate Deepak Chahar, who believes India skipper is a "next-level player" altogether.
On Wednesday evening, Kohli scored an unbeaten half-century to help India beat the Proteas in the second T20I at the IS Bindra PCA Stadium and take an unassailable 1-0 lead in the three-match series. With this innings, Kohli also surpassed Rohit Sharma to become the highest scorer in T20Is.
He now has 2,441 runs in the format while Sharma has 2,434. Kohli has also become the only batsman to have his batting average above 50 in all three formats of the game.
Kohli's innings was studded with four fours and three sixes and he took 52 balls to remain unbeaten at 72.
"I don't know how Virat bhaiya (brother) manages to score these many runs and that too with such consistency. He is a next-level player," said Chahar at the post-match presser.
Speaking about his own performance in the match, Chahar, who picked two wickets while conceding 22 runs from his stipulated 4-over spell, said he finds it easy to bowl in the death overs due to the presence of extra fielders outside the 30-yard circle.

"I find it easy to bowl death overs because, in the powerplay, you only get two fielders outside the circle. However, after the powerplay, you get five fielders outside. Therefore, I find it easy to bowl death overs,"
On being asked about next year's World T20 to be held in Australia, the right-arm pacer said that he is not thinking too far ahead and is taking one match at a time.
"It is still one year for the World Cup and I do not think far too ahead. I take every match as my last match," he said.
"At this time, Indian cricket is at the top and if you want to find a spot, you will have to do very good and that too, in every match because there is a lot of competition."
The two teams will now lock horns with each other in the final T20I to be played on Sunday at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.

Times Now
Steve Smith is being hailed as a phenom following his astounding effort with the willow in the recently concluded Ashes 2019. The Aussie batsman piled up as many as 774 runs in just seven innings at an average of more than 100 as he helped Australia retain the Ashes for the first time since 2001 on English soil. While Smith has returned to the Australia squad as just a player, not captain, former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting has backed Smith to take the captain’s armband sooner or later.
However, Ponting was unsure of how things would be taken in Australia if Smith is made the captain of the team once again. The 30-year-old was sacked from captaincy following his involvement in the infamous sandpaper ball-tampering scandal in 2018 which rocked Australia cricket.
Smith was handed out a 12-month ban along with David Warner while Cameron Bancroft was given a nine-month ban. In addition to the ban, it was stated by Cricket Australia that Smith won’t be considered for a leadership role for a year after the ban finishes.

"Steve Smith – I think he will captain again. I don't know what the Australian public might think about that," Ponting said at an event at Australia House in London.
"So to me that seems like Cricket Australia has left the gate open ... so if Cricket Australia thinks it's OK then I'm happy with [it,]" Ponting added.
The former Aussie skipper said Smith knows his role in the team even without the captain’s armband. Ponting reckoned that it won’t be too long until Smith is back being the captain of the team once the ban is lifted.
"I think he knows his role now. But once that ban is lifted, I don't think it will be too long until he's captain again," Ponting said.
Tim Paine’s captaincy came under the scanner during Ashes 2019 following glovesman's repeated failure of successfully taking DRS. It was a DRS mistake by Paine and Australia which had cost them the Headingley Test.

Paine’s batting form has also been a talking point for quite some time now. Since October 2018, Paine has managed to score just two half-centuries in Test cricket and such things may play a role if he is to be removed from captaincy role in future. However, it will be interesting to see how the Australian fans react if Smith is given the captain’s armband once again.

The Financial Express
Opposition parties Thursday contested Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s claims on development and law and order during the first half of his term, with the Samajwadi Party saying Uttar Pradesh is moving at the speed of a bullock cart.
“The UP government is making false claims and celebrating the completion of two-and-a-half years. People thought that with a double engine the state’s progress will gain momentum, but it is moving ahead at a snail’s pace,” SP president Akhilesh Yadav said.
The “double engine” was a reference to the BJP’s earlier claim that the state will develop quicker with the same party in power in Lucknow and at the Centre.
“The pace of the state’s development is not that of a double-engine machine but of a bullock cart,” Yadav said.
The opposition attack followed Adityanath’s press conference here on his government reaching the mid-point of its five-year term. Adityanath had claimed that the perception about the state has changed during his term and the “improvement” in law and order had played an important role in this.
“There has not been a single incident of riot in the state in the past two-and-half years,” Adityanath said, referring apparently to large-scale communal clashes. The Opposition parties disagreed.
“The chief minister’s claims on law and order are far from truth. The reality is that during his tenure crime against girls has hit an all-time high,” Yadav said.
“So many murders never took place in the past,” he claimed. “UP has surpassed other states in incidents of loot, rape and murder.”
Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar said, “The law and order scenario in the state is grim.”
“There is fear in the minds of the people. Incidents of rape are being reported from different parts of the state. Atrocities committed on women and murders are taking place at busy locations in the state capital,” Babbar alleged.
Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said the BJP government’s record in the state so far has been “disappointing”.
“This government has failed badly particularly on law and order and controlling crime,” she tweeted in Hindi.
Congress spokesman Anshu Awasthi said the government’s “only achievement” has been saving “rapist MLAs” and leaders associated with it.
Rashtriya Lok Dal spokesperson Anil Dubey also referred to crime against women and the notices served by the National Human Rights Commission to the state.
The remarks were an indirect reference to the rape accusation against former Union minister Swami Chinmayanand in Shahjahanpur and a similar charge against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Unnao.
Though the Shahjahanpur woman recorded her statement before a magistrate on Monday, an FIR mentioning the rape charge is yet to be lodged in the state.
The police, however, say they are following procedure and will submit a report to the Supreme Court after completing their probe by September 23.
During his press meet, Adityanath said the prosecution in sexual assault cases against minors has been speeded up.
He gave an example from Auraiya, in which a life imprisonment sentence has already been pronounced for a rape committed in the first week of August.
Akhilesh Yadav claimed the BJP government is patting itself on back over farm loan waiver but the farmers are still committing suicide.
Congress spokesperson Awasthi asked, “What happened to the promise to the youth on providing jobs?”
“This government has, however, been successful in organising big events by spending a lot of money, claiming investment of over Rs 4.28 lakh crore through the investors’ summit. But what is the result? They lack the right intention of seeing these development projects become a reality,” he said.
RLD’s Dubey claimed the Adityanath government has failed to keep its promises not only on law and order, but also on issues concerning farmers, youth and women.
“Inflation, power tariff hike and unemployment are glaring issues but the government has remained busy in just patting its back without caring for the problems of the common man,” Dubey added.

Reuters
LOS ANGELES/JEDDAH (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday there were many options short of war with Iran after U.S. ally Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said were used in a crippling attack on its oil sites that was “unquestionably sponsored” by Tehran. 
 “There are many options. There’s the ultimate option and there are options that are a lot less than that. And we’ll see,” Trump told reporters in Los Angeles. “I’m saying the ultimate option meaning go in — war.” 
The president struck a cautious note as his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during a visit to Saudi Arabia, described the attacks as “an act of war” on the kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter. 
Trump said on Twitter that he had ordered the U.S. Treasury to “substantially increase sanctions” on Iran, which denies carrying out the attacks, and told reporters the unspecified, punitive economic measures would be unveiled within 48 hours. 
Trump’s tweet followed repeated U.S. assertions that the Islamic Republic was behind Saturday’s attacks and came hours after Saudi Arabia said the strike was a “test of global will”. 
Iran again denied involvement in the Sept. 14 raids, which hit the world’s biggest crude oil processing facility and initially knocked out half of Saudi output. Saudi Arabia is the world’s leading oil exporter.  
Responsibility was claimed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which on Wednesday gave more details of the raid, saying it was launched from three sites in Yemen.  
In a remark that may further strain a tense political atmosphere in the Gulf, the Houthis said they had listed dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh’s top Arab ally, as possible targets for attacks. 
To bolster its assertion that Iran was responsible, Saudi Arabia showed drone and missile debris it said amounted to undeniable evidence of Iranian aggression.  
A total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks sponsored by Iran but not launched from Yemen, Defense Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told a news conference.”The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,” he said, adding Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were used in addition to cruise missiles. 
An investigation into the origin of the attacks was still under way and the result will be announced later, he said. 
The attack exposed gaps in Saudi air defenses despite billions spent on Western military hardware. 
Proof of Iranian responsibility, and evidence that the attack was launched from Iranian territory, could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response. Both nations, however, were stressing the need for caution.  
Trump has previously said he does not want war and is coordinating with Gulf and European states. 
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, said the strike was a “real test of the global will” to confront subversion of the international order. 
His envoy to London, Prince Khalid bin Bander, told the BBC the attack was “almost certainly” Iranian-backed: “We’re trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.” 
The Islamic Republic dismissed the allegations. 
“They want to impose maximum ... pressure on Iran through slander,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said.  
“We don’t want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?” he added, blaming Washington and its Gulf allies for the war in Yemen. 
Yemen’s Houthi movement, battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition for more than four years, said it used drones to assault state oil company Aramco’s sites. U.S. officials, however, have said the attack was not launched by the Houthis. 
The raid exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure and threw down a gauntlet to the United States, which wants to curb Iranian influence in the region. 
“The attack is like Sept. 11th for Saudi Arabia. It is a game changer,” said one Saudi security analyst. 
Visiting Jeddah, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attacks would be a major focus of next week’s annual U.N. General Assembly meeting and suggested Saudi Arabia could make its case there. 
“It was an act of war against them directly, and I’m confident they will do that,” he told reporters before meeting the Saudi crown prince, later tweeting that the United States supports Saudi Arabia’s right to defend itself.         
The two men “agreed that the Iranian regime must be held accountable for its continued aggressive, reckless, and threatening behavior,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement after their talks. 
U.N. officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were also heading to Saudi Arabia to investigate. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a major confrontation in the Gulf would have “devastating consequences” for the region and globally.  
France, which is trying to salvage an international nuclear deal with Iran that Washington quit last year, said it wanted to establish the facts before reacting. 
A U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday the strikes originated in southwestern Iran. Three officials said they involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating more complexity and sophistication than initially thought. 
Saudi Arabia’s finance minister told Reuters the attack had no impact on revenues and Aramco was continuing to supply markets without interruption. 
U.S. efforts to bring about a U.N. Security Council response looked unlikely to succeed as Russia and China have veto powers and were expected to shield Iran.

The New Indian Express
WASHINGTON: Gun violence costs the US $229 billion annually, amounting to 1.4 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), a report said.
The report, which used data from the Giffords Law Centre to Prevent Gun Violence and the Centres for Disease Control for a state-by-state analysis of gun violence costs, was commissioned by Congressional Democrats, Xinhua news agency reported.
Lost income represents the biggest cost to the nation's economy, the report said on Wednesday.
Other major expenses include employer costs, police and criminal justice responses and health care treatment.

Rural states, including Mississippi and Alabama, have the highest costs of gun violence measured as a share of their economies.
States with high rates of gun ownership such as Alaska and Arkansas have the largest rates of gun suicide. Alaska also has the highest overall gun death rate per capita of all 50 states.
The report also found that children and teens were also at a much higher risk of firearm-related injuries and deaths in the US, compared to other advanced countries.
"The US stands alone in this degree of gun violence," Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, told a hearing on Wednesday. "The human costs are beyond our ability to comprehend, it is tragic, it is sickening and it is a crisis."

The report came as the White House is reportedly circulating a memo on Capitol Hill detailing a possible proposal to expand background checks for gun sales.
The memo proposes expanding background checks to all advertised commercial sales, including sales at gun shows.
If someone who attempts to buy a firearm fails a background check, it would be reported to law enforcement officials, according to the memo.
This year, several mass shootings claimed scores of lives in the US, bringing back public attention to the nation's gun violence epidemic.
The White House and Congressional Democrats, however, remain divided over what actions should be taken.
There have been 40,331 gun violence-related incidents in the US this year as of Wednesday, killing a total of 10,681 people, according to the non-profit Gun Violence Archive.

There’s very little doubt that Steve Smith and Virat Kohli are two of the best batsmen in world cricket currently. Smith made a staggering comeback to the Australian team in the recently concluded Ashes series. While most experts are divided and aren’t too sure who is the better amongst the two, many are backing Steve Smith in Tests.
Former England off-spinner Monty Panesar is also of the opinion that Smith is the better of the two batsmen. Smith has twenty-six centuries to Kohli’s twenty-five centuries. As an overall package, he is a tad behind Kohli but only when it comes to crowning the best in the longest form of the game, the Indian skipper comes second best.

“Steve Smith is a better Test batsman than Virat Kohli,” Panesar told The Times of India (TOI) in an exclusive interview. “But if you take an overall package, especially limited-overs, Virat stands out. He is overall a world class batsman. Virat is the best batsman in the world. Smith is the best Test batsman in the world,” said Panesar.
Monty Panesar who played fifty Tests for England claiming 167 wickets praised India’s premier batsman even more by saying that with his consistency and ability he surely will beat Sachin Tendulkar’s record of hundred international centuries.
The left-arm spinner also had some ravishing words of praise to share about India’s speed sensation Jasprit Bumrah. Bumrah has changed the landscape of Indian fast bowling according to Panesar. He felt that the pacer would go on to achieve more laurels for the country and said that his stint under Sachin Tendulkar with the Mumbai Indians led to his growth.
“I am sure Sachin has played a crucial role in Bumrah’s development. He has a huge influence on him. What length to bowl, how to swing, how to judge a batsman- all these things he has learnt so quickly. How you think about the game and how you tactically take the right decisions- all these things Bumrah has learnt so fast under the able guidance of Sachin,” Panesar stated.
Monty Panesar does make some valid observations. Steve Smith is probably the best in Test cricket now, the way in which he made a stunning, almost unbelievable comeback to the team post a one-year ban speaks volumes about his physical and mental strength. Overall, definitely India’s crown Virat Kohli would rank ahead of Smith and it won’t be too surprising to see him overtake Sachin Tendulkar’s coveted record of 100 international centuries.

Cricket Country
Captain Tim Paine has predicted a “very exciting era” for Australian cricket after the team retained the Ashes against England, while revealing he broke his thumb in the final Test. The series was drawn 2-2, with Australia keeping the urn as the Ashes holders despite losing the last Test at the Oval by 135 runs.
“I’m looking forward to Australia seeing how far we’ve come this summer,” Paine said in a column for The Australian newspaper, referring to upcoming home Tests against Pakistan and New Zealand. “Last year we were a bit lost and were finding our way,” he added after the side struggled in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
“I know we have found it now and I am confident this group is the beginning of a very exciting era in Australian cricket. We’ve got the best bowling attack in the world and the basis for a great batting line-up.”
Australia retaining the Ashes was built on the back of an incredible series by former skipper Steve Smith, who scored 774 runs in just seven innings, and an impressive bowling attack led by Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.
Paine called Smith “a freak” while also praising Marnus Labuschagne as having “a huge future” after he too enjoyed a stellar tour with the bat. But he revealed the last Test was a struggle for himself and fast bowler Peter Siddle.
“My thumb was broken towards the end of that Test but it is not displaced, so I should be right to get back into training early,” said Paine, while praising workhorse Siddle who was battling a hip injury.
“He has copped a bit of criticism for not bowling as well as… we know he can, but the team knows just how heroic he was. A lot of other people wouldn’t have bowled again in the match, but he pushed on because he didn’t want to leave Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to do extra work.”
Coming off a long overseas tour and with five home Tests starting from November 21, Paine said he needs to rest and will not play the domestic Big Bash League Twenty20 competition this season.
“Being captain is draining and I think I should take every chance to recharge my batteries,” he said.

Times Now
Karnataka: A youth from Karnataka's Vijaynagar agreed to swim in a drain after he lost a game of PUBG to his friends. The video of the youth swimming in the drain has been doing the rounds on social media. Locals noticed the youth and informed the police. Allegedly, the teen decided to risk his life after losing at PUBG. 
According to the youth's friends, he was confident about winning the game. However, when he lost, the youth accepted the challenge of swimming in the drain. After the video surfaced, parents in Karnataka's Belagavi staged protests, demanding a ban on the online game. 
In the video, the youth can be seen swimming in a drain which is full of wastes and garbage. The youth was seen wading through the dirty drain, all for losing a game of PUBG. To treat the growing PUBG addiction between youths and adults, a separate clinic has been set up in Karnataka's Neminath Hospital. 
Player's Unknown Battleground or PUBG is an online video game that was launched in India in July this year. It became instantly popular among youth and adults. In the past as well, the game has been criticised for encouraging violence. 
In September this year, a youth allegedly murdered his father and chopped off his head and legs as he wanted to play the game without being interrupted. The incident came to light from Karnataka's Belagavi district. The deceased was identified as Shankrappa Kumbar. A retired cop, Kumbar used to scold his son for being addicted to PUBG. 
The accused was identified as Raghuveer Kumbar. Raghuveer Kumbar used to have arguments with his father over his addiction to the online game. On the night of the incident, Raghuveer Kumbar's father started scolding him for playing the game. The two had an argument and in a fit of rage, Raghuveer Kumbar murdered his father and cut off his head. 
Raghuveer Kumbar said that he murdered his father so that he could continue playing the game in 'peace'. The accused was arrested by the police and was taken into custody.

Reuters
JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A U.S. drone strike intended to hit an Islamic State (IS) hideout in Afghanistan killed at least 30 civilians resting after a day’s labour in the fields, officials said on Thursday. 
The attack on Wednesday night also injured 40 people after accidentally targeting farmers and labourers who had just finished collecting pine nuts at mountainous Wazir Tangi in eastern Nangarhar province, three Afghan officials told Reuters. 
“The workers had lit a bonfire and were sitting together when a drone targeted them,” tribal elder Malik Rahat Gul told Reuters by telephone from Wazir Tangi.  
Afghanistan’s Defence Ministry and a senior U.S official in Kabul confirmed the drone strike, but did not share details of civilian casualties. 
“U.S. forces conducted a drone strike against Da’esh (IS) terrorists in Nangarhar,” said Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. “We are aware of allegations of the death of non-combatants and are working with local officials to determine the facts.” 
About 14,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, training and advising Afghan security forces and conducting counter-insurgency operations against IS and the Taliban movement. 
Haidar Khan, who owns the pine nut fields, said about 150 workers were there for harvesting, with some still missing as well as the confirmed dead and injured. 
A survivor of the drone strike said about 200 labourers were sleeping in five tents pitched near the farm when the attack happened. 
“Some of us managed to escape, some were injured but many  were killed,” said Juma Gul, a resident of northeastern Kunar province who had travelled along with labourers to harvest and shell pine nuts this week. 
Angered by the attack, some residents of Nangarhar province demanded an apology and monetary compensation from the U.S. government. 
“Such mistakes cannot be justified. American forces must realise (they) will never win the war by killing innocent civilians,” said Javed Mansur, a resident of Jalalabad city.  
Scores of local men joined a protest against the attack on Thursday morning as they helped carry the victims’ bodies to Jalalabad city and then to the burial site.  
Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor said the aerial attack was meant to target IS militants who often use farmlands for training and recruitment purposes, but had hit innocent civilians.     
Jihadist IS fighters first appeared in Afghanistan in 2014 and have since made inroads in the east and north where they are battling the government, U.S. forces and the Taliban.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India meets the criteria for trade concessions that the United States eliminated in June, India’s Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said on Thursday. 
The United States removed India from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme that allowed duty-free entry for up to $5.6 billion worth of its annual exports to the United States, citing lack of reciprocal market access.  
Washington should take a call on reinstating trade concessions under the GSP, Gokhale told a news conference. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump later this month in the United States.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet executives from energy majors BP PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp in the United States next week to discuss investment opportunities, the foreign ministry said on Thursday.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Pusarla Sindhu will be a strong contender for the women’s gold medal at next year’s Tokyo Olympics but the 24-year-old’s recent World Championship triumph will also make her a target, India’s national coach Pullela Gopichand said. 
Sindhu won India’s first-ever title at the world badminton championships when she defeated Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara 21-7 21-7 to win the women’s singles in Basel last month. 
It was also an end to Sindhu’s frustrating near-misses, having finished runner-up at the 2016 Olympics, last year’s Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and the previous two world championships finals. 
With her silver from Rio, Sindhu is already India’s most successful female Olympian but the latest triumph also boosted the nation’s hopes of a medal in Tokyo next year. 
“I think it would be fair to say that she would be one of the big contenders for the gold medal,” Gopichand told Reuters in an interview. 
“But having said that, there is competition, and it just gets more for Sindhu because she will be the target, people have a year to plan against her.  
“So, of course she needs to train, she needs to evolve, she needs to add new thinking to the armoury and that’s very important.” 
While India’s field hockey team have won eight Olympic titles, shooter Abhinav Bindra remains the only individual gold medallist for the country of 1.3 billion, who are starved of top sporting success outside cricket. 
In the world championships semi-finals, an aggressive Sindhu dismantled China’s Chen Yufei 21-7 21-14 while it took her just 38 minutes in the final to see off Okuhara with the Japanese player wilting under a barrage of smashes from her opponent.      
Gopichand was delighted with Sindhu’s aggression and termed the manner of her championship win as “very special”. He, however, warned her ward to continue to evolve ahead of Tokyo.

The New Indian Express
CUTTACK: A 26-year-old man was sentenced to death by a special court here on Thursday for raping and killing a six-year-old girl in Cuttack district in April 2018.
Additional District and special POCSO court Judge Vandana Kar sentenced Mohammad Mustaq to capital punishment after convicting him under section 302 (murder) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Special Public Prosecutor A K Nayak said.
The girl was found in a critical condition with deep injuries on her head, face and neck and groin areas from a school campus in Jagannathpur village under Salepur police station limits in the evening of April 21, 2018.
Mustaq of the village was arrested the day after the incident.
The girl died while undergoing treatment at the SCB Medical College and Hospital here on April 29, 2018.
The girl had gone to a kiosk in her village to purchase biscuits on that fateful evening but went missing.
She was later found lying unconscious in a pool of blood without clothes on her body inside the school campus.
After committing rape, the convict had brutally assaulted the girl apprehending trouble as she had raised an alarm.
Mustaq was booked under section 302 of the IPC after the girl died.
A 500-page chargesheet was submitted in the case, in which 23 witnesses were examined, Nayak said.
This was the fourth death penalty awarded in less than two months in Odisha by POCSO courts.
On September 10, a court in Jagatsinghpur sentenced a man to death for raping and killing a nine-year-old girl in a village last year, while on August 28, a 25-year-old man was awarded death penalty in Mayurbhanj district for raping and killing an eight-year-old tribal girl last year.
On July 26, a POCSO court in Angul sentenced a 20-year-old man to death for raping and killing a girl.

The New Indian Express
JERUSALEM: Israel's embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday called on his main challenger Benny Gantz to form a unity government with him to avoid a third election, after no clear winner emerged in the unprecedented repeat polls.
With nearly 97 per cent of votes counted on Thursday, Gantz's Blue and White party stood at 33 seats in Israel's 120-seat Parliament. Netanyahu's Likud stood at 31 seats. "During the elections, I called for the establishment of a right-wing government, but, sadly, the results of the elections have shown that this is not possible," said 69-year-old Netanyahu, pointing out that the nation did not definitively side with either bloc.

"The Right cannot form a coalition and there should be as broad a unity government as possible. Therefore, there is no choice but to establish a wide unity government as wide as possible that's made up of all the officials that Israel called on," The Jerusalem Post quoted Netanyahu as saying.
Netanyahu also asked Gantz, 60, to meet with him as soon as possible to start the process. "I call on you MK Benny Gantz. Benny, it's on us to establish a wide unity government today. The nation expects us, the both of us, to work together. Let's meet today. At any time, at any moment. In order to begin this process that is demanded of us at this time. We cannot and have no reason to go to a third election. I oppose it. The call of the hour is to form a broad unity government today," said Netanyahu.
Netanyahu recalled the unity government between Shimon Peres and his Likud rival Yitzhak Shamir that was created in the 1980s when the election results were similarly deadlocked. "When there was no clear outcome from the Knesset elections, Shimon chose national unity. He and Yitzhak Shamir agreed to cooperate - to navigate Israel's path to safety," the Likud leader said.
He called on Gantz to follow in Peres' footsteps, so that together they could similarly navigate Israel to safety, the paper said. His statement about the Peres-Shamir cooperation was seen as a reference to a possible rotation in the Prime Minister's Office. The paper added that Peres and Shamir rotated as prime ministers from 1984 to 1988. Blue and White rejected the offer as "spin."
Meanwhile, the leaders of all the parties in the right-wing religious bloc on Thursday signed a document to recommend Netanyahu as the next prime minister and vowed to enter a coalition only as a single unit. The document was signed by Netanyahu; United Torah Judaism leader Yaakov Litzman; and Yamina MKs Ayelet Shaked, Naftali Bennett, Rafi Peretz and Bezalel Smotrich.
Shas leader Aryeh Deri gave his consent via phone and said he would sign the document soon. Netanyahu called the snap election after failing to form a governing coalition with a viable majority after April's vote.
His victory in the April 9 polls securing him a record fifth term proved temporary in the face of a logjam between potential coalition partners over a military conscription bill governing exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students.
With no clear winner, some analysts here see the chances of a coalition government coming in place quite bleak at the moment. Netanyahu, who has been premier for a total of more than 13 years, faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three cases.
Israel has always had a coalition government and never seen a single party rule since its independence. The religious parties, themselves a divided lot but definitely on the Right side of the political spectrum, have always been a part of the coalition governments except one led by Ariel Sharon.
Labour party leader Amir Peretz and Democratic List leader Ehud Barak have served in governments led by Netanyahu at different times during the last ten and a half years.

Washington [USA], Sept 19 (ANI): US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo on Wednesday termed the drone attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia as an "Iranian attack" while also described it as an "act of war.""We were blessed that there were no Americans killed in this attack but any time you have an act of war of this nature, there's always risk that that could happen. This is an attack of a scale we've just not seen before," CNN quoted him as saying.Pompeo, who is on a two-day visit to the Gulf region following the attack, also said, "This was an Iranian attack. It's not the case that you can subcontract out the devastation of 5 per cent of the world's global energy supply and think that you can absolve yourself from responsibility. Were it the case that the Houthis' fraudulent claim was accurate, were that true -- it's not, but were that true, it doesn't change the fingerprints of the Ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply."The US Secretary of State said that the weapons used in the attack were not in the possession of Yemen's Houthi rebels.The drone on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia took place on Saturday. The attack was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels who are backed by Iran. (ANI)

KABUL (Reuters) - A Taliban truck bomb killed at least 20 people and wounded 95  when it exploded near a hospital in southern Afghanistan on Thursday, a provincial official said, with casualties expected to rise as rescuers sift the rubble. 
The Taliban, who have been carrying out nearly daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks with the United States this month, said the target was a nearby building of the government’s intelligence department in Qalat, the capital of Zabul province. 
“The bomb was huge and it was carried by a mini-truck,” said a senior defense ministry official in the capital, Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media. 
The militants wanted to target a training base for Afghanistan’s powerful National Directorate of Security, but parked the vehicle laden with explosives outside a hospital gate nearby, said another defense ministry source.  
Twenty bodies and 95 wounded people had been evacuated from the blast site, said Haji Atta Jan Haqbayan, a member of the provincial council in Qalat. 
“The number of casualties may rise as rescue teams and people are still searching for bodies under the rubble,” he added. 
Several women, children, health workers and patients in the hospital were critically injured in the blast. 
There has been no let-up in Taliban attacks across Afghanistan as it prepares for a presidential election this month. 
The Taliban has warned that its fighters will step up their campaign against the Afghan government and foreign forces to dissuade people from voting in the Sept. 28 election. 
More than 9 million Afghans are expected to vote in the presidential election, during which the government has committed more than 70,000 security forces across Afghanistan to protection duties. 
U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly ended talks this month with the Taliban for a deal on the withdrawal of thousands of American troops from Afghanistan, in exchange for security guarantees from the hardline Islamist group. 
The talks, which did not include the Afghan government, were intended to lead to wider peace negotiations to end the 18-year-long war in Afghanistan.

The Indian Performing Right Society (IPRS) has come to the aid of veteran music composer Vanraj Bhatia following reports about his declining health and poor financial situation.
Bhatia, 92, is best known for providing music to films such as Ankur, 36 Chowringhee Lane and TV show Tamas, for which he won a National Award.
Earlier this week, a daily reported on Bhatia's ill health and dwindling financial state. The veteran is having trouble walking properly and is not able to get treated due to lack of funds.
IPRS, headed by veteran screenwriter Javed Akhtar, stepped in for help after the news. It is a registered body which safeguards the rights of authors (lyricists), music composers and music publishers in the country. "We always strive to help our music fraternity through all available means whenever needed. The moment we came to know about the ill-health of our composer friend Vanraj Bhatia, we immediately released from our funds for his aid.
"Going forward, we are looking into long-term plans to ensure financial and other stability to IPRS members. Authors and composers in India must join IPRS and register their works with IPRS. IPRS can provide them security and long term financial stability as their right," Akhtar said in a statement.
"Artistes must receive their due. Whatever is being done for the veteran Vanraj Bhatia is his rightful due. We are proud that we are able to help him in his difficult times. We wish him good health," said Rakesh Nigam, CEO of IPRS.

When Vishal Sikka joined Infosys, he was asked what Sikka meant and he replied that it meant money. His stint with Infosys was not long, but the technocrat has all the chops to raise money. 

In a statement, Sikka said that his startup Vianai Systems raised $50 million from undisclosed investors. This funding is also the largest seed round for a company whose website does not say much about the business yet. In the Bay Area, businesses raise money on paper based on the people who have built big businesses in the past.

The company’s website says that it is looking at opportunities in design thinking and artificial intelligence (AI). Design thinking, as a term, was a big part of Sikka's narrative at Infosys. 


After Infosys, Sikka spent more than a year formulating the idea of how AI can help organisations scale business. 

There is a lot of value to be derived from AI. Larry Ellison, Chairman of Oracle, has been promoting it. In fact, Sikka recently made a presentation about the benefits of AI and about Vianai Systems at Oracle's Open World. 

The global business value derived from AI is projected to total $1.2 trillion in 2018, an increase of 70 percent from 2017, according to Gartner. AI-derived business value is forecast to reach $3.9 trillion in 2022.

The Gartner AI-derived business value forecast assesses the total business value of AI across all the enterprise vertical sectors covered by Gartner. There are three different sources of AI business value: customer experience, new revenue, and cost reduction.


"One of the biggest aggregate sources for AI-enhanced products and services acquired by enterprises between 2017 and 2022 will be niche solutions that address one need very well. Business executives will drive investment in these products, sourced from thousands of narrowly focused, specialist suppliers with specific AI-enhanced applications,” he added.

AI business value growth shows the typical S-shaped curve pattern associated with any emerging technology. In 2018, the growth rate is estimated to be 70 percent, but it will slow down through 2022. After 2020, the curve will flatten, resulting in low growth over the next few years. And this is perhaps the reason why Sikka believes AI is going to change the future.

The News Minute
In a shocking incident, a 24-year-old man was allegedly lynched and burnt alive at Shamirpet, in the outskirts Hyderabad, by a mob on suspicion that he performed black magic. According to the police, family members of K Lakshmi, a woman who died on Tuesday due to ill health, suspected that the victim, B Anjaneyulu, an auto driver, could have performed black magic on her leading to her death. The incident took place in Adrasapalle village.
Police said that Anjaneyulu and Lakshmi were neighbours, and for the past five years Lakshmi was suffering ill health and availing treatment at Osmania General Hospital. However, she died on Tuesday, following which her funeral was conducted on Wednesday.
According to locals, Anjaneyulu and his father were known to allegedly practise witchcraft, and Lakshmi’s family members always suspected the duo for Lakshmi’s poor health.
On Wednesday, Anjaneyulu reportedly came to attend Lakshmi’s funeral. Furious over his presence, Lakshmi’s brother-in-law Balram and other family members allegedly attacked Anjaneyulu with axes and sickles, and further threw him into Lakshmi’s funeral pyre.
Police learnt about the incident around 9 pm the same day. Subsequently they began their investigation and cordoned off the crime scene. Soon, Anjaneyulu’s brother also approached the Shamirpet police station claiming that his brother was missing.
On Thursday morning, dog squad, CLUES team and a police team led by DCP Padmaja Reddy visited the graveyard.
Police found a bloodstained spot in the graveyard and recovered a handkerchief from the scene. They also collected bones from the pyre and sent them for forensic analysis.
Speaking to the media, the DCP said, “At the crime scene we spotted a bloodstained area and a handkerchief. The CLUES team has collected all the materials from the scene. Teams have been formed to nab Balram, who is absconding, for further investigation.”

BEIJING (Reuters) - China auctioned 10,000 tonnes of pork from state reserves on Thursday to secure meat supply during the National Day holiday, the country’s commerce ministry said, after disease ravaged the world’s largest pig herd.  
Beijing also released 2,400 tonnes of beef and 1,900 tonnes of mutton from state reserves this month, according to a statement published on the ministry’s website. 
Pork prices have jumped sharply recently and demand for the meat has fallen, the ministry said.

supplies & cool pork prices     tmsnrt.rs/31za5sn 
The ministry said it would continue to monitor supplies and pork prices while coordinating with other government departments to release meat from state reserves as required to guarantee supply in the market. 
With a significant increase in meat imports and as the volume of frozen meat in reserves remains high, supplies are secured, it added. 
Thursday’s auction was seen by analysts as a symbolic gesture, however, and unlikely to cool pork prices. Those eclipsed 40 yuan ($5.64) per kilogramme in early September, almost 80% higher than a year earlier. 
“Our consumption is 12,000 tonnes a day,” said Ma Chuang, partner at Beijing-based consultancy Boyar. “It’s just a signal that the state is paying attention to the problem.” 
But Ma agreed that there was plenty of frozen meat in storage, with high prices being driven by the shortage in freshly slaughtered meat - much preferred over frozen in China - not a lack of meat overall. 
China celebrates its National Day on Oct. 1 with holidays lasting a whole week.  
“During the holidays lots of people go travelling and eat out. The restaurants mainly use frozen meat so there won’t be a big impact,” said Ma, but he added that high prices were a longer-term concern. 
Pork prices in the world’s top consumer hit record levels after an epidemic of African swine fever that has reduced the hog herd by around 40%. 
The disease is not harmful to people but kills almost all pigs infected.

Beijing is rolling out measures to help recover pig production and secure meat supplies, especially during the holidays, when demand usually peaks. 
China consumed about 54 million tonnes of pork in 2018 but volumes this year are uncertain because of the shortages.

Gone are the days when children’s wedding expenses made it to the top of financial goals for parents. Young parents in India are beginning to reorient their goals, with stronger emphasis on their own retirement and children’s education. At a time when social media is being bombarded with glitzy celebrity wedding pictures every few months, Gaurav Verma, 43, director of government and regulatory affairs of a medical technology company, and his wife Gunjan don’t want to specifically save for the weddings of their two daughters Vasudha, 16, and Veda, 8. They instead want to focus on their own retirement and their daughters’ careers.
The Verma family is not an aberration, and the way Gen X is prioritising its goals is evolving significantly. Gen X includes people born between 1965 and 1980, according to Pew Research Center. “People are taking their own retirement seriously and are waking up to the fact that even after regular income stops, expenses won’t stop or reduce. Also, Gen X parents don’t want to depend on anyone for their needs," said Shweta Jain, certified financial planner, chief executive officer and founder, Investography Pvt. Ltd.
Mint spoke to at least five financial planners, including Jain, who confirmed that the urban mass affluent was now more focused on their retirement and the education of their children rather than organising their wedding. According to Aegon Retirement Survey 2017 by Aegon Center for Longevity and Retirement, 59% Indians are habitual savers and make sure they save for retirement systematically, while, globally, just 39% people are saving for retirement in an organised manner.

		             NEW DELHI :
Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Bimal Jalan, who has held top government positions including the post of finance secretary, is often credited with successfully guarding India’s financial system during the East Asian financial crisis. Most recently, his report, as chairman of the panel set up to review the hotly debated economic capital framework of RBI, was able to strike a fine balance in maintaining the credibility of the central bank and partially satisfying the government’s need for additional funds in a fiscally tight year. In an interview, Jalan elaborates on the logic behind his report and his views on the state of the economy. Edited excerpts:
How would you characterize the current state of the economy?
As you know, all the factors are known. For example, the growth rate is not as good as it should have been. It is very low now at 5%. Credit demand is low. The amount of investment, which is going on, is lower than what it used to be. So, all these factors are there. But inflation is low. We have not seen increase in consumption demand. That is an issue. My view is, in a year or two, we will probably see a turnaround. This is cyclical. I don’t regard this as structural. But, so far as the fundamentals of the economy are concerned, they are still very strong. The factors of production—land, labour, capital, entrepreneurial capacity—are strong even now.
Do you think the government’s measures are enough to reverse the economic downturn?
It’s very hard to say what is sufficient. ‘Sufficient’ in my view is the implementation part, not the announcement part. For example, if you decide that I am going to restructure the economy and the investment rate has to be increased by 4 percentage points over the next one year or so, then implementation is of crucial importance. The equally important thing is administrative reforms. The government should decide the policies, how much resources the budget can provide for different types of investments in different segments. And then they should have an interaction—as the present finance minister is having with all the agencies on the ground—and decide on a time frame which should be relatively short-run, not 2025. In the present circumstances, that is what is of utmost importance. I hope implementation will happen, with delegation of authority rather than six-seven administrative ministries deciding. Let the ministries decide policy and the amount of money that will be available, and where the money needs to be spent, where the roads and ports will be built. Once those are done, then leave it to the implementing authorities to actually get it done. And the ministries can monitor.
Do you think the government should provide a fiscal stimulus?
Out of the total expenditure of the government, public expenditure in the investment area is not very huge. So far as fiscal stimulus is concerned, what is important is how much of that increase is due to the focus on relatively short-term capital expenditure that can be implemented on the ground. Whether fiscal deficit is 3.4% or 3.5% is not important. The amount of extra money required for investment is not very high to implement in the short run. You can increase capital expenditure in the margins without allowing fiscal deficit to go out of control.
Everybody expected the panel, headed by you, to recommend that RBI’s surplus will be released to the government in tranches. Did the panel have a change in mind at the last minute?
All alternatives were considered, as you would see in the report. As a percentage of GDP, the transfer of funds is not that high. The full resilience of RBI has been reserved. It is a one-time transfer and the government can decide how to spend, where to spend and how to maximize the outcome.
What is the rationale of not including the revaluation reserves in the dividend formula?
We wanted resilience of RBI as there are fluctuations in prices and so on. Resilience of RBI should not get affected. If you need it in some later years, something needs to be done, there is defence or security (exigency) as it happens from time to time, then you can do that, next year, or year after. All these things are open to consideration, depending on what the circumstances are. 
But under the present formula, can the revaluation reserves be touched? 
Anybody can touch anything. It’s up to the government and RBI. RBI can revise its opinion. It’s not written in stone. RBI and the government may have accepted the report. If something was required to be done in public interest, this report does not say it should not be done.
Both RBI and the finance ministry take action based on the current situation. If circumstances change, then the action will change. This report is written depending on the circumstances and depending on expectations. The report is not a constitutional activity. It’s an advisory report. 
Do you think the panel disappointed the government on its expectation of higher surplus transfer?
Everybody is entitled to his or her views. We are a free country. You arrive at a consensus and proceed. And we arrived at a consensus and we are all fine with it.
Would you have personally liked the transfer of a higher surplus to the government?
No, I can’t say what I would have preferred personally or not (laughs).
Was it one of the points of contention with one of the previous representatives of the government (S.C. Garg)?
No comments.

Times Now
Los Angeles: Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston was asked to lose 30 pounds if she wanted to sustain in the showbiz. In a new book, titled "Generation Friends: An Inside Look at the Show That Defined a Television Era", Saul Austerlitz said it was always tough to be a woman in the industry and match up to its impossibly high beauty standards.
"She had to lose thirty pounds if she wanted to stay in Hollywood. Los Angeles was a tough place to be an actress, it was a tough place to be a woman, and Jennifer Aniston's agent was reluctantly leveling with her," Austerlitz writes.
According to the excerpts obtained by People magazine, Aniston once received a callback where she was told to wear a leotard, and she jokingly said to her agent: "This'll blow it for me."
Her representative, in turn, "responded seriously".
"Aniston was hardly fat everyone could see she was beautiful but as the show she would one day become indelibly associated with later made a point of noting, the camera added 10 pounds," Austerlitz added.
Aniston had also discussed the same call back in a 1996 interview with The Rolling Stones magazine.
"My agent gave it to me straight. Nicest thing he ever did. The disgusting thing of Hollywood I wasn't getting lots of jobs 'cause I was too heavy," Aniston had said at that time.
The actor, 50, was cast in the role of Rachel Green in "Friends" in 1994 and the show made her a global star, giving her a strong footing in Hollywood.

India's government is open to selling a partial stake in debt-laden state-run carrier Air India to a foreign airline, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The government has moved about 300 billion rupees ($4.21 billion) of Air India's debt to a separate holding company, leaving the carrier with roughly another 300 billion rupees of debt, the people said.
The government will also likely invite preliminary bids for the carrier by 10 October, the sources added.

In a shocking turn of events, a decomposing corpse was found on the premises of a farmhouse owned by Telugu star Nargarjuna Akkineni on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Wedneday 19 September.
The 40-acre property, located in Papireddyguda in Telangana's Rangareddy district was bought by Nagarjuna only recently. He had been visiting the land to plant saplings and working with organic cultivation experts to find better ways of farming.
The skeletal remains of a body were found by farm workers who noticed a foul smell coming from a room in an abandoned building. The police were immediately informed.
Investigation officers have claimed that the unidentified individual is suspected to have died 6 months ago and the cause of death could be suicide.
SI Venkateswarulu of the Keshampet police had this to say to The News Minute.
The post mortem will be conducted on Thursday.

Google  said today it is bringing its mobile payments app — Google Pay — to businesses in India as the Android-maker rushes to maintain its payments lead in one of its key overseas markets before its global rival Facebook sets off a similar play in the nation.
Even as more than 400 million users in India are online today, most businesses in the nation remain unconnected, Google executives said at their annual event in New Delhi. Google, which has previously launched a handful of tools in India to help businesses build some presence on the web, is having another crack at it.
“India has more than 60 million small and medium-sized businesses, however only a fraction of them support digital payments. Imagine the transformation that is possible if more of these merchants could access payments online,” said Ambarish Kenghe, director and product manager for Google Pay.
One of the big challenges that is preventing these businesses to support online payments is the tedious process that is currently required for them to on-board a digital payments solution. “An agent is supposed to come to your shop and then they do the verification for you,” he said. Google has figured out a better way to address this challenge.
The company today unveiled Google Pay for Business, a standalone app that will enable businesses to accept online payments without having to deal with an agent. “Merchants will now be able to support digital payments at their own convenience through a remote video process within minutes,” he said.
The company also unveiled a software platform called Spot that will allow businesses to easily create their own branded commercial fronts that will be accessible to customers through Google Pay app. So for instance, if a restaurant has built its store front, users will now be able to see their offerings in the Google Pay app itself. The company said several businesses in India like UrbanClap, Goibibo, MakeMyTrip, RedBus and Eat.Fit are already making use of this feature.
“We hope these initiatives will help merchants adopt digital payments with more confidence, and help contribute the long-term growth of online financial services for the benefit of every Indian,” said Kenghe.
The company has also developed Spot codes, which are like QR codes, that a business could use to allow people in its store to quickly scan and pick the items from the store they wish to order and pay for it. “A customer can come back later and pick up their orders without waiting in long lines,” explained Arjita Madan, a product manager at Google.
The company is also bringing a feature that will enable users to discover entry-level and white-collar jobs through the Google Pay app. “Jobs will be available as a Spot on Google Pay to help job seekers find and prepare for entry-level positions that fit their needs,” said Caesar Sengupta (pictured above), VP of Next Billion Users Initiative and Payments at Google.
He said Google is using machine learning to better understand its users, so that it recommends the right kind of jobs to them. A user only needs to provide two sets of information to get started with the feature: What kind of job are they looking for? And, how soon they want to land the job.

About two dozen companies, including Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo in delivery and logistics and 24Seven and Healthkart in retail are early partners of Google to use Pay’s jobs discovery feature, the Mountain View giant said.
Google launched its payments app Google Pay (called Tez then) in 2017. Pay is built on top of Indian government-backed UPI payments infrastructure and rivals Flipkart’s PhonePe app for the tentpole position. The company said today Google Pay has amassed 67 million monthly active users in India and has processed transactions worth $110 billion in the last year.
The payments market in India — which is projected to be worth $1 trillion by 2023, according to Credit Suisse — is becoming aggressively crowded and competitive. Google today competes with PhonePe, Amazon Pay and Paytm, the country’s most popular mobile wallet app, whose parent company has raised more than $2.3 billion from investors.
Google also announced that it is bringing tokenized cards for debit and credit cardholders in India, which will allow them to pay for things using a digital token instead of their actual card number. The company said it will roll out the feature to Google Pay users in the coming weeks, starting with Visa cards for HDFC, Axis, Kotak and Standard Chartered banks. The feature also will support Mastercard and Rupay at a later stage.
The addition of new features is crucial for Google Pay, which prior to today’s announcements did not have many differentiating elements. It is also racing against time as Facebook’s WhatsApp, which has over 400 million users in India, is set to expand its UPI-based payments service to all its users by the end of the year.
In the meantime, Paytm is working to expand its reach in the nation, too. The company, which posted a yearly loss of over $500 million last year, said earlier this month it intends to invest another $3 billion into its business in the next two years.

The Wire
New Delhi: A special CBI court on Thursday extended former finance minister P. Chidambaram’s judicial custody till October 3.
The 74-year-old senior Congress leader, who was arrested by the investigative agency last month in connection with the controversial INX media case, was sent to judicial remand for 14 days on September 5.
Chidambaram’s time in Tihar jail was supposed to end today.
On Thursday afternoon, however, the CBI moved an application seeking an extension of judicial custody before the special court at the Rouse Avenue Court Complex.
Senior advocate Abishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Chidambaram, argued that “reasonable grounds” must exist for extending judicial custody and that it should only be for four more days if granted.
Singhvi also requested the court to order a medical examination of the former finance minister, who has reportedly lost weight over the last two weeks.
Responding to these claims, solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that the health of any inmate at Tihar Jail is a concern and that medical care could be given as per the provisions of the law.
Chidambaram also told that the court that he had “developed back pain” as he neither had a chair nor a pillow in his cell. While his lawyers were arguing for his release, Chidambaram interrupted to add, “There were chairs outside the room, I used to sit there during the day, now that too is withdrawn. Because I was using it, they have taken it away, now even the warden is without a chair.”
Even as Singhvi added that he had a chair “three days ago, now there is no chair, no pillow either”, Mehta called it “a small issue”.
“No need to sensationalise it. It’s a petty issue. There was no chair in his room from beginning,” he added.
After deliberating over the matter, however, the court decided to extend Chidambaram’s judicial custody until October 3. The senior Congress leader will be allowed to meet his family on a regular basis in this time.
Chidambaram’s bail hearing in this matter is expected to be heard by the Delhi high court next week.

The News Minute
Congress leader DK Shivakumar, who has been accused in a money laundering case, was sent to Tihar jail on Thursday. The senior party leader was undergoing treatment at RML Hospital and was taken to Tihar after being discharged from the hospital.
On Tuesday, the CBI court in New Delhi remanded the senior leader to judicial custody until October 1. 
In the meantime, Lakshmi Hebbalkar the Karnataka Congress MLA from Belagavi, appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Delhi after she was summoned for questioning in connection to the case.
The ED had been probing accusations of money laundering registered against DK Shivakumar since August 2017 when a cash amount of Rs 8.86 crores was found in the his New Delhi residence. He was arrested on September 3 after being accused of setting up hawala networks to launder money. A day later, he applied for bail which the ED rejected stating that Shivakumar would “influence witnesses.”
KM Nataraj, the Additional Solicitor General representing the ED, stated that Shivakumar and his family members held more than 300 bank accounts altogether and had accused him of laundering over Rs 200 crore in cash.
As part of the probe into the case back in 2017, the Income Tax Department found that some transactions made by the party leader were linked to Lakshmi Hebbalkar. Further, when the raids first took place on August 2, 2017, Shivakumar had made a phone call to Lakshmi.
She had earlier been issued a summons by the ED to appear on September 14, but was unable to do so. The summons date was then pushed to September 19.
Prior to this, DK Shivakumar’s daughter Aisshwarya appeared before the ED on September 12 and was questioned for seven hours in connection to the case. At the time, officials from the ED stated that she was being questioned about a trust fund set up in her name. The ED also interrogated her regarding the increase in her wealth between 2013 and 2018. Shivakumar declared that his daughter held assets worth Rs 108 crores, ahead of the 2018 Karnataka State Assembly Elections. However in 2013, she supposedly only had Rs 1.09 crores.
The senior leader has been taken to Tihar jail where he has reportedly been lodged in the same jail compound as former Finance Minister P Chidambaram.

Times Now
New Delhi: Police in Maine, United States of America, have arrested a woman for allegedly giving her infant daughter small doses of heroin in order to help the child sleep. It is being reported by various media affiliates that these doses of heroin over a period of two months led to the baby's death. Based on statements from eyewitnesses, police have booked 33-year-old Kimberly Nelligan, the deceased child's mother.
Nelligan has been charged with child endangerment and possession of drugs. At present, she is facing up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $2,000 for endangering the life of a child and up to 180 days in jail along with $1,000 fine for possession and use of drugs. The woman from Maine continued to showcase remorse even during her visits to the courthouse for the hearing. She was eventually granted bail but ordered to stay away from her husband and any children below 18 years of age.
In his statement to the police, Nelligan's husband said that she rubbed heroin residue on their daughter's gums about 15 times over the course of the past two months. According to the medical examiner's office, acute fentanyl intoxication led to the child's death on October 10 of last year. The infant likely digested the drug that killed her, said a report. A potent synthetic opioid prescribed during the treatment of severe pain, fentanyl is also used for capital punishment in America.
The Maine mom initially told police officers that she never consumed the drug. However, she later confessed to snorting heroin from time to time around the months surrounding her daughter's death. In addition, Nelligan also told officers probing the matter that she used the drug to put her other children to sleep in the past. The accused's husband confirmed that she rubbed their daughter's gums about 15 times with heroin residue.
The mother in her affidavit wrote that she did not hurt her daughter on purpose. However, trouble for Nelligan could rise further with the investigation into the case still underway and police likely to frame more charges against her. District Attorney Marianne Lynch said that laws are not exactly designed to deal with serious and difficult cases such as this. Lynch added that prosecutors are confident of going ahead with the current charges for now and will act accordingly if new allegations emerge against Nelligan.

The New Indian Express
DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand government has decided to make Sanskrit language compulsory in all government and private schools from Classes 3 to 8. 
Arvind Pandey, state education minister said, "Sanskrit is our ancient and language of Gods. We must acknowledge that this language has enriched our culture beyond measure. Our generation should know the language."
The state education department has been instructed by the education minister to implement the decision strictly in all the schools operating in the state.
The officials of the state education department told that guidelines will be in place soon to implement the curriculum of Sanskrit. "The guidelines will also include penal measures in case private schools affiliated with several boards such as ICSE and others refuse to implement Sanskrit curriculum, " said R Meenakshi Sundaram, secretary education, Uttarakhand. 
Four major languages are spoken in Uttarakhand at present including Hindi, Kumaoni, Garhwali and Jaunsari. According to estimates, over 89% of the populace of the state speaks these four languages including Hindi (45%) followed by Garhwali (23.03%), Kumaoni (19.94%) and Jaunsari (1.35%). 
Many other languages are also spoken in the hill state including Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Nepali, Maithili, Tharu, Jan, Rangpo, Darmiya, Byangsi, Raji, Chaudangsi and Rawat to name a few. 
Interestingly, main regional languages Kumaon and Garhwali have been accorded the status of endangered languages by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 
Shekhar Pathak, a Padam Shri awardee historian commenting on the development said, "The propagation of our culture including languages is important but regional languages should also be promoted with the same zeal as our national languages. Ours is a diverse country with multiple languages, tradition, culture and cuisine. We should be careful to impose any sort of monoculture."
An official from a school of international repute based in Dehradun told this publication on the condition of anonymity, "We will implement the government directives but our policymakers should think seriously before making such unilateral decisions. Analysis should be done by the educationists and state government about the motive and outcome of such a curriculum."

Reuters
STRASBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union warned on Wednesday that Britain was headed for a damaging no-deal Brexit, with London’s ideas for solving the contentious issue of the Irish border still unlikely to unlock a deal just six weeks before Britain is due to leave. 
Addressing EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him on Monday that London still wanted a deal, but would leave with or without one on Oct. 31. 
“There is very little time left ... The risk of a no-deal is very real,” said Juncker, his comments weighing on sterling. 
Pro-Brexit lawmakers cheered and applauded in the Strasbourg chamber.  
“It’s time for a clean-break Brexit,” said Brexit campaigner Matthew Patten. Other pro-Brexit EU deputies tried to shout down pro-EU British colleagues, shouting “You lost!” and “Rubbish!” 
A majority of EU lawmakers later voted for an extension to Britain’s scheduled departure date in a resolution that is not binding but which has political weight. 
EU leaders will meet for a make-or-break summit in Brussels on Oct. 17-18, just a fortnight before Brexit is due to materialise more than three years after Britons voted to leave. 
Britain is not likely to present a complete set of detailed, written proposals of how it would want the text of the existing - but stalled - Brexit deal changed before the end of the month, UK and EU sources said. 
“If that is the case, the summit will end with nothing,” an EU diplomat dealing with Brexit in Brussels said. “If there is to be a deal, it must be prepared to a large extent in advance. It is too technical to leave to the leaders at the last minute.” 
In a worst-case scenario, a no-deal Brexit could mean severe disruption to trade, supplies of medicines, fresh foods and  possible public disorder, according to the British government’s contingency plans. 
Such a sharp break in economic ties, ending four decades of EU membership, “might be the United Kingdom’s choice, but never the choice of the EU,” Juncker said, highlighting how the bloc wants to avoid blame if Britain crashes out. 
Juncker said London must present realistic proposals to replace the Irish backstop arrangement in the Britain-EU divorce agreement, which former premier Theresa May agreed with EU leaders but which was rejected by the British parliament. 
“I am not emotionally attached to the Irish backstop,” Juncker said. “I have asked the prime minister to make, in writing, alternatives,” he said, calling it a safety net to avoid a divided Ireland after Brexit.  
The backstop would require Britain to obey some EU rules if no other way could be found to keep the land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland invisible. 
Johnson’s office said in a statement late on Wednesday that the British leader had spoken with Juncker and the president of the European Parliament to reassure them that work was underway to find an alternative to the backstop. 
“The Prime Minister and President Juncker discussed the positive and constructive conversation they had in Luxembourg on Monday and their shared determination to reach a deal,” a spokesperson for Johnson said. 
But Juncker’s pessimistic tone on Wednesday was echoed by Finland’s minister for European affairs, Tytti Tuppurainen, who told the parliament that a no-deal Brexit “is a quite likely outcome.” Finland holds the EU’s rotating presidency. 
However, many EU lawmakers warned against a no-deal, both to avoid an economic shock and because they do not want to see Britain abandon its commitments to EU social and environmental standards and become a low-tax, low-regulation rival. 
“We will not accept a Singapore on the North Sea,” said former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, a liberal EU lawmaker and a member of the parliament’s Brexit committee. 
In an at times bad-tempered debate underscoring general weariness on the tortured issue of Britain’s pending departure, senior EU lawmakers took jabs at the noisy contingent of British eurosceptic deputies in the chamber. 
Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right EPP group, called Brexit “stupid”. He and Verhofstadt took aim at British plans for greater sovereignty at a time when the parliament in Westminster has been suspended by Johnson. British pro-EU deputy Julie Ward called the prime minister “disreputable”.  
“Brexiteers claimed Westminster would take back control, but now they shut it down,” Weber, a German lawmaker, said in Strasbourg, as the Supreme Court in London continued hearing arguments on whether Johnson acted unlawfully in suspending the parliament in the run-up to Brexit. 
The European Parliament formally called on Wednesday for Britain to be granted another extension to allow more time for London to agree the terms of its withdrawal. The resolution passed with 544 in favour, 126 against and 38 abstentions.  
Britain’s departure has already been delayed twice since March and Johnson has vowed he would not seek another extension. 
The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said a no-deal Brexit would not resolve any of the issues around the rights of EU citizens, the Irish border and British obligations under the bloc’s long-term budget. 
“If the United Kingdom leaves without a deal, all these questions will not disappear. They are still there,” Barnier told the EU chamber. “Some three years after the Brexit referendum we should not be pretending to negotiate.”

Google  Assistant, the digital assistant from the global search giant, is available to users through their smartphones, laptops and smart speakers. Earlier this year, the company partnered with KaiOS to bring Assistant to some feature phones with internet access. Now Google is going a step further: Bringing its virtual assistant to people who have the most basic cell phone with no internet access. It’s starting this program in India.
At an event in New Delhi on Thursday, the company announced a 24×7 telephone line that anyone in India on Vodafone and Idea telecom networks (or Vodafone-Idea telecom network, as Vodafone owns Idea) could dial to have their questions answered. The company said it tested the phone line service with thousands of users across Lucknow and Kanpur before making it generally available.
Users will be able to dial 000-800-9191-000 and they won’t be charged for the call or the service. Manuel Bronstein, a VP at Google, said through this program the company is hoping to reach hundreds of millions of users in India who currently don’t have access to smartphones or internet.

Even as there are more than 500 million users with access to internet and about 450 million with smartphones in India, more than half of the nation’s 1.3 billion people remains unconnected.
India has emerged as one of the last great growth markets for Silicon Valley companies that are looking to find their next billion users worldwide. But to reach these users, companies are required to put in some extra work: build and customize services to address the local challenges.
On Wednesday, Amazon said its digital assistant service Alexa now understands and speaks Hindi. Only 10% of India’s 1.3 billion people speak English. There are over half a billion people in India who speak Hindi, however. Google said today that Hindi had already become the second most popular language for its digital assistant service.
Google also unveiled a new Google Assistant feature called interpreter mode that will serve as a real-time translator between two people speaking different languages. Google said the feature would support translation between English and Hindi and will roll out in the coming months.
Google Assistant, which supports nine Indian languages, now also allows users to ask their commands in a language that is not set as their preferred device language. “Many users often prefer to set the phone language to English, while choosing to speak to their device in their local language. That’s where language decoupling comes in — Indian users can now simply ask to change their Assistant language,” the company said.
“Starting today, you can talk to your Assistant in the nine Indian languages for example, for talking in Hindi –you can simply say ‘Hey Google, talk to me in Hindi’ to start using the Assistant in the language, without needing to dig around in settings.”

TechCrunch
Lyft  is facing another lawsuit pertaining to its handling of alleged sexual assaults at the hands of drivers on its platform. In a suit filed today in the San Francisco Superior Court, Alison Turkos accuses Lyft of 11 counts, including general negligence, vicarious liability for assault with a deadly weapon, sexual assault, sexual battery and breach of contract.
The lawsuit describes how the plaintiff’s Lyft driver allegedly kidnapped her at gunpoint and took her across state lines, where the driver and other men took turns raping her, the lawsuits states.
“Alison remembers the men cheering and high fiving each other as they continued to rape her,” the lawsuit alleges. “Their attack was so brutal that the next day Alison experienced severe vaginal pain and bleeding. Her body was so exhausted from the attack and resulting trauma that Alison could not even leave her bed or raise her arms.”
When the plaintiff reported it to Lyft, the lawsuit alleges Lyft simply apologized for “inconvenience” and gave her a partial refund for the ride. Lyft, however, says the incident was not initially reported as a safety incident, but rather as an indirect route issue. Lyft says it did not become aware of the incident until May 2018, when the Wall Street Journal ran a piece on it.
“What this rider describes is awful, and something no one should have to endure,” a Lyft spokesperson told TechCrunch. “The unfortunate fact remains that one in six women will face some form of sexual violence in their lives — behavior that’s unacceptable for our society and on our platform. In this case, the driver passed the New York City TLC’s background check and was permitted to drive.”
The spokesperson added, “We constantly work to improve the platform, which is why we have invested in new features, protocols and policies to protect our riders and drivers. This year alone we’ve launched 14 new safety features — including daily continuous background check monitoring, in-app emergency assistance, and mandatory feedback for any ride rated less than four stars.”
The plaintiff says she reported the crime to the police, who performed a rape kit that found evidence of semen from at least two men on the clothing she wore that night.
The New York Police Department then transferred the case to the FBI, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit states the FBI is now investigating the incident as a human trafficking case. However, Lyft “has been wholly uncooperative” throughout the NYPD and FBI’s investigation, the lawsuit alleges.
In May 2018, Lyft says it received a subpoena from law enforcement and worked with law enforcement for over a year during the investigation.
The lawsuit seeks special damages, including economic restitution to cover past and future hospital expenses, as well as expenses relating to her profession and loss of earning capacity.
“By failing to take reasonable steps to confront the problem of multiple rapes and sexual assaults of LYFT passengers by LYFT drivers, LYFT has acted in conscious disregard of the safety of its passengers,” the lawsuit alleges.
This suit comes just weeks after 14 women filed suit against Lyft alleging the company has not addressed complaints pertaining to sexual assault. Both suits recommended Lyft adopt new policies, such as the addition to the app of a surveillance camera that can record audio and video of all rides.
Meanwhile, Lyft recently announced new safety features, including trip check-ins if a ride seems to be taking longer than it should and in-app 911 calling.
“We’re committed to playing a significant role in connecting our communities with transportation, and we understand the responsibilities that come along with that,” Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer wrote in a blog post. “We’ve known since the beginning that as part of our mission, we must heavily invest in safety. We continue to welcome accountability and partnership to best protect our rider and driver community.”
It’s no coincidence that Lyft announced these safety features in light of the lawsuit on behalf of those 14 women. The company had previously taken some steps to address safety, but at a much slower pace than competitor Uber, which has also faced a number of sexual assault and abuse lawsuits. Between 2014-2018, CNN found 103 Uber drivers who had been accused of sexual assault or abuse of passengers.
Over the years, both companies have taken steps to ramp up their respective safety procedures. In April, Uber launched a campus safety initiative while Lyft implemented continuous background checks and enhanced its identity verification process for drivers. Uber, however, implemented continuous background checks about a full year before Lyft, and added an in-app 911 calling feature more than a year before Lyft.
“We don’t take lightly any instances where someone’s safety is compromised, especially in the rideshare industry, including the allegations of assault in the news last week,” Zimmer said earlier this month in that same blog post. “The reality is that certain populations carry a disproportionate burden simply trying to get to work or back home after a night out — in the U.S., one in six women will face some form of sexual violence in their lives. The onus is on all of us to learn from any incident, whether it occurs on our platform or not, and then work to help prevent them.”

New Delhi: Ride-hailing companies such as Ola and Uber have hit demand for new cars in India as young buyers don’t need to buy cars for commuting and can spend most of their income on electronic gadgets, said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker.
Bhargava’s latest statement supports the contention of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman who cited millenials’ unwillingness to buy cars as one of the reasons for a slump in sales.
Bhargava, a former bureaucrat, said there is “no point" in a temporary cut in the goods and services tax (GST) on vehicles as it would not help the industry in the long run. He said the introduction of stricter safety and emission regulations would improve the quality of vehicles produced in India and put them on a par with those in Europe.
Bhargava said the buying power of Indians has not risen in line with the increase in car prices, leading many to postpone purchases as car prices have been increased to adhere to new norms.


“The per capita income in India is almost around $2,200 (per annum) and in Europe, it is approximately around $40,000. In terms of all standards, which add to the cost of the product, there is no difference between Europe and India," Bhargava said. “In addition, the taxation levels in India, whether it’s in terms of GST, road tax and others, are much higher than in Europe or even China for that matter. How do you expect a country with such a low per capita income to have enough customers to have the capacity to pay for a car and grow at 10-15% every year?"
Passenger vehicle sales in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market have slumped in the past year as lack of financing options, increase in ownership costs and an economic downturn have discouraged people from buying cars.
Bhargava said Sitharaman “is correct" in saying that the youth are opting for Ola and Uber rather than buying new vehicles during the initial years of their careers.

The Financial Express
India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman defended her handling of the economy in a Twitter post, following criticism by a corporate leader on the lack of fiscal measures to support growth. “As Finance Minister — you might’ve observed — I’ve been working on and regularly speaking about measures we’ve been taking on matters of the economy,” Sitharaman said via Twitter, responding to Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, head of Indian drug-maker Biocon Ltd. Shaw wondered why the finance minister, and not the health minister, was addressing a press conference on ban of e-cigarettes in India. In the first of a series of tweets, Sitharaman justified her presence at the event that had given rise to speculation about more steps to support growth.


While Sitharaman tweets regularly about her ministry’s achievements and her personal life, including her love for making pickles, she’s rarely responded to social media criticism on her work as Finance Minister.
Sitharaman, who took over her as Finance Minister in May, is under pressure to bolster growth that’s slowed to a six-year low and check unemployment that’s risen to a 45-year high. The government’s measures to reverse the slowdown have so far come in “tranches” and are seen as inadequate.
Sitharaman is due to address a press conference later Thursday after a meeting with heads of state-run banks to review transmission of the central bank’s 110 basis points of interest rate cuts this year.

Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], Sept 19 (ANI): Rajnath Singh, who became the first defence minister to fly a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, said he was thrilled and called it a special experience.The 68-year-old Minister completed a 30-minute sortie on Thursday. He was accompanied by Air Vice Marshal N Tiwari, Project Director, National Flight Test Centre, ADA (Aeronautical Development Agency) in the familiarization sortie. "I was very thrilled and it was a special experience. I want to praise the bravery of our air force fighters and all the armed forces. Tejas is fourth-generation fighter aircraft and it is indigenous. First time, I flew this and the flight was very smooth and comfortable. I was enjoying," he said."There were some acrobats up in the air. I want to congratulate scientists, ADA, HAL and DRDO. Today other countries are demanding for Tejas. We have reached a situation where we can supply aircraft to other countries," he addedSingh flew in Tejas that took off from the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) airport here this morning.Sharing his experience, the Defence Minister said, "It is an indigenous aircraft and therefore I want to experience its flight.

It is meant to strengthen India's air defence capabilities."Meanwhile, Air Vice-Marshal N Tiwari, Project Director, National Flight Test Centre, ADA (Aeronautical Development Agency) speaking to media said that the Defence Minister was very happy with the flying quality of the aircraft (LCA Tejas)."We went close to Mach 1 i.e. the speed of sound," Tiwari said.DRDO Chief Dr G Satheesh Reddy said, "The Defence Minister also controlled Tejas for some time." The Tejas is an Indian single-engine, delta wing, multirole light fighter designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force and Indian Navy.It came from the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme, which began in the 1980s to replace India's ageing MiG-21 fighters.

New Delhi: Several commuters including officer-goers in Thursday faced trouble as cabs, private buses, taxis and autorickshaws stayed off roads following the transport strike against the newly amended Motor Vehicles Act. Reports claimed that the strike, in some areas of the national capital, turned ugly when transport workers forcefully dragged off passengers from cabs and autos. At the Akshardham area, protesters vandalised cab for ferrying passengers.
The United Front of Transport Association (UFTA) general secretary Shyamlal Gola had yesterday said,”We have been seeking redressal of our grievances related to the new MV Act from both the Centre and the Delhi government for the last 15 days, but no solution is there is sight forcing us to go on a one-day strike.” He had claimed that said over 50 transport associations and unions in Delhi-NCR were participating in the strike.
Meanwhile,  there was no impact of the strike on Delhi Metro and Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses. Speaking to a leading portal, a government employee said that he had to opt for Delhi Metro today as the chartered bus from his residential colony did not ply.
Several schools in Delhi-NCR also remain closed in view of the strike. “In view of the proposed transport strike in Delhi, the school will remained closed on Thursday, September 19, for all students and teachers. It has also been decided that this holiday will be compensated later. However, it will be a normal working day for the administrative staff,” said a message reportedly sent by DPS read.
At Chinmaya Vidyalaya, exams scheduled for today were postponed. “Due to the transport strike called by the United Front of Transport Association, the school will remain closed on September 19. The scheduled exam for classes IV-XII will be held on September 20. For detailed information, please check the school website,” a message from ITL Public School read.

The New Indian Express
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan warned Pakistanis on Wednesday not to go to Kashmir to fight jihad, saying it will hurt the cause of the Kashmiris.
"If anyone from Pakistan goes to India to fight jihad, he will be the first to do an injustice to Kashmiris, he will be the enemy of Kashmiris," Khan told the media after inaugurating the Torkham Terminal at Pak-Afghan border.
Khan claimed that India needed just "an excuse to launch crackdown on the besieged people of Kashmir." He has repeatedly claimed that India could launch a "false flag" operation to divert attention from Kashmir.
Khan's statement to discourage jihadi activities in Kashmir came ahead of his crucial visit to US where he would address the UN General Assembly and meet US President Donald Trump.
He said he will "forcefully present the Kashmir issue like never before" at the UN General Assembly session next week.
Khan also ruled out talks with India unless New Delhi lifts curfew in Kashmir and revoke the abrogation of Article 370.
A planned march by some political and religious parties towards the Line of Control with India was postponed early this week after Khan asked them to postpone it till his address at the UN General Assembly on September 27.
Tension between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5.
Reacting to India's move on Kashmir, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner.
Asserting that abrogation of Article 370 was its internal matter, India has strongly criticised Pakistan for making "irresponsible statements" and provocative anti-India rhetoric over issues internal to it.
Khan also claimed that the attack on a Hindu temple in Ghotki in Sindh province was a conspiracy to sabotage his UN General Assembly address, where he would raise the Kashmir issue.
"I condemn what happened in Ghotki," he said, adding that all citizens are given equal importance in the Constitution and Islam.
On Sunday, 50 people vandalised a Hindu temple in Ghotki after an alleged case of blasphemy.
Khan also said that Pakistan will make its utmost effort for the resumption of the stalled peace process in Afghanistan.
The Prime Minister said he will insist for resumption of peace talks during his meeting with President Trump on Monday in New York.
He said it will be tragedy if the talks do not resume and the Taliban do not participate in the Afghan elections.
Khan's comments came days after President Trump said that the peace talks with the Taliban are "dead".
The president had stunned the world on Saturday when he announced the cancellation of a secret meeting with the Taliban and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani at Camp David near Washington.
It came after the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul erly this month, in which an American soldier were among the dead.
Trump said the decision to invite the Taliban to Camp David was his, and so was the call to cancel it.
Khan said peace in Afghanistan is in the interest of Afghan people as well as Pakistan.
He also said that the round-the-clock opening of the Torkham border crossing will facilitate trade in the region.
"I consider this to be a very historic day," he said, adding that trade with Afghanistan had jumped by 50 per cent during the trial of the 24/7 border opening.

The New Indian Express
TEL AVIV: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not be travelling to New York for the 74th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session scheduled to be held next week.
The announcement was made by Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Wednesday (local time).
This comes after the incumbent Prime Minister Netanyahu failed to secure sufficient support in elections to form a new government with his right-wing political allies.
The Time of Israel quoted Netanyahu's office as saying that he would forgo the trip due to the current "political circumstances". Foreign Minister Israel Katz will attend in Netanyahu's stead, it said. This also effectively means that he will not be meeting US President Donald Trump.
This will be for the first time since 2010 when Netanyahu will give the UNGA session a miss.
The current elections came after Netanyahu failed to form a government after elections in April. Netanyahu had expressed confidence about retaining power.
Netanyahu had postponed his India visit which was scheduled to take place a week before the elections in Israel.

Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com, Walmart-owned Flipkart and other e-commerce portals in India scrambled on Thursday to pull listings of vaping products a day after the federal government imposed a nationwide ban on electronic cigarettes. 
Warning of an “epidemic” among young people, India banned sale, production, import and advertising of e-cigarettes, dealing a blow to plans of companies such as Philip Morris International and Juul Labs to sell the products in India. 
Websites such as Vapestop and Litejoy, which offered vaping products online, discontinued their operations and ran disclaimers related to the government order. 
Vaping products, however, were still available on Amazon’s India site, while Flipkart and Softbank-backed Snapdeal removed e-cigarettes which were available earlier in the day, Reuters found. 
“Online advertising and sales are banned. E-commerce service providers should take down the advertisements and sale offers immediately,” Vikas Sheel, a senior health ministry official  told Reuters, when asked about the online listings. 
Amazon’s India site was selling the “Honey Badger” vape device, which resembles a USB flash drive, for 2,799 rupees ($39.35), with flavoured refills. Flipkart had also listed the product earlier. 
Amazon said e-cigarettes are not allowed to be listed or sold on Amazon.co.in as per its policy and it takes action if it learns about sellers evasively listing a prohibited product. 
A source with direct knowledge said that Amazon was working to quickly remove the listings. 
Flipkart in a statement said it was aware of the ban order and was working with sellers to remove all such products. 
Snapdeal, another leading e-commerce website in India, said the e-cigarette category had been disabled. 
On Wednesday, India’s health ministry said use of e-cigarettes had increased exponentially and acquired epidemic proportions in developed countries, especially among youth and children. 
India’s ban was issued through an executive order, which has been in force since Wednesday night, a health ministry spokeswoman said. 
Pro-vaping groups in India have criticized the government’s decision, saying it would deter people from switching from conventional cigarettes to less harmful alternatives.

Times Now
Actor Vicky Kaushal who played the role of Major Vihaan Singh Shergill in the 2019 hit film Uri: The Surgical Strike remembered those martyred in the dastardly Uri attack three years ago.
It was on this day in 2016 when some Indian Army soldiers lost their lives after they were attacked by some heavily armed terrorists in the Uri town in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
Honouring those dead souls, the 31-year-old shared a picture of the martyred soldiers together on his Instagram story and wrote, "Remembering the brave hearts we lost on this day 3 years in the Uri attack."

However, just 11 days after the day, the Indian Army retaliated with what came to be known as the surgical strikes against some militant launch pads.
Uri: The Surgical Strike which released earlier this year was based on these 2016 surgical strikes and featured Vicky in the lead.
The film was helmed by Aditya Dhar and also starred Paresh Rawal as the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Yami Gautam as a no-nonsense interrogation officer.

Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar just did what most Bollywood celebrities wouldn’t dare to - he took the Mumbai Metro! The actor took to Twitter to share a selfie video in which he elaborates on his experience.
In the video, Akshay explains how he ended up in the metro. He says, “I was shooting in Ghatkopar. I wanted to go to Versova and my map said that it would take me 2 hours and 5 minutes. So my director, Raj, who has directed Good News, suggested we take the metro instead.”
“I am quietly standing here in a corner. I think some people have recognised me. I’ll show you how it is,” he adds. Akshay then also flips the camera and gives us a glimpse of the crowded metro.
He further says that it takes the metro only twenty minutes to cover the said distance.  He also says, “This is the only transportation on an elevation so no matter how much it rains, the metro will not be affected.”
Finally he concludes by thanking Raj for the adventurous idea and signs off with a goodbye.
Watch the video here:
Akshay’s upcoming film Good News also stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh, and Kiara Advani. The comedy pairs Kareena and her Kambakkth Ishq co-star Akshay, and Diljit and Kiara who play two married couples who are trying to have a baby. It will release on 6 December.

Engadget
You'll soon see fewer ads for "flat tummy" tea and lip fillers on Instagram. The social media platform announced today that it is tightening restrictions on posts related to diet products and cosmetic surgery. The new rules -- first reported in the London Evening Standard -- will apply to both Facebook and Instagram, and will result in age restrictions being applied to some posts and other posts being removed entirely.
The social media platforms will ban posts promoting dubious weight loss products that are linked to a commercial offer (like a discount code). Furthermore, both will restrict users who are under 18 years old from viewing content that promote the use of certain weight loss products and cosmetic procedures.
Instagram's public policy manager, Emma Collins, said in an interview with the London Evening Standard that the platform worked with external experts to make this change without ruining the spirit of Instagram. "We want Instagram to be a positive place for everyone that uses it and this policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel as a result of social media," said Collins.
Dr. Ysabel Gerrard, a professor at the University of Sheffield and one of the outside experts Instagram consulted prior to the change, tweeted that she worked with a team of academics, activists and practitioners, including actress Jameela Jamil. According to Gerrard, Instagram will remove posts that make a "miraculous claim" about a diet or weight loss product. Users will also be able to report posts they believe are in violation of the rules.
"Miraculous claims means they aren't sustainable. Products like skinny teas, these have been publicly criticised as they offer short term solutions to something that naturally takes a lot longer. It's hard to blame social media solely for influencing eating disorders, but the content we see on social media is a contributing factor to how we feel about our bodies," said Gerrard in an interview with the London Evening Standard.
Gerrard told Engadget that she does anticipate pushback from companies that hawk such products over the policy change. "I do anticipate pushback from companies or individuals who sell these products, but they must act responsibly and re-shape their products and marketing techniques to optimise people's safety," said Gerrard in a direct message on Twitter. She also added that she did not get paid for her work with Instagram.
Numerous studies have suggested that Instagram may be a contributing factor to eating disorders and depression among teenagers. The social media platform has also been blamed for a rise in interest in plastic surgery -- such as fillers and Botox -- among younger individuals.

Bengaluru-based wealth management platform Groww, on Thursday, raised $21.4 million as a part of its Series B funding round led by US-based VC firm Ribbit Capital along with participation from existing investors Sequoia India and Y Combinator.

According to the startup, Groww will use these funds to double its employee count to 200 plus, and hire across functions of engineering, product, and growth teams. The company also aims to use a significant portion of the capital to fortify tech capabilities and build super scalable infrastructure for investing.

A part of the funding is expected to be used for compliance purposes.

Lalit Keshre, Co-founder and CEO, Groww, said,

Founders of Groww(L to R): Ishan Bansal, Lalit Keshre, Neeraj Singh, and Harsh Jain

Micky Malka, Founder of Ribbit Capital, said,

Groww has been raising new funds over the last year. It raised $6.2 million in Series A funding led by Sequoia Capital earlier this January. Prior to that, it raised $1.6 million in funding led by Insignia Ventures Partners, Lightbridge Partners, Kairos, and others. 

Incorporated in 2016, the startup was started by four ex-Flipsters Lalit Keshre, Harsh Jain, Neeraj Singh, and Ishan Bansal, to help users invest in mutual funds directly.

The platform has more than 2.5 million users across India, with 60 percent of them coming from outside of the top six cities. Lalit also claims that two-third of their customers are first time investors (in online financial instruments) and continue to be between the ages 25 and 40. 

Additionally, it has directly partnered with close to 36 to 40 AMCs. 

On Groww, Ashish Agrawal, Principal, Sequoia Capital India LLP, added,


In the next one year, Groww is looking to introduce three to four newer investment products on its platform. This will include tapping into ETFs and other asset classes. The founders also state that they are looking to launch ‘Digital Gold’, on the platform.

		             NEW DELHI :
Automobile sales have continued to decline in India amid newer safety and emission norms, higher vehicle prices and an overall consumption slowdown. In an interview, R.C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, agreed that many youngsters prefer gadgets over cars, and the lack of affordability is keeping many potential customers away. Indian automakers are now on par with Europe and America in terms of quality but the purchasing power of domestic buyers has not grown enough to afford the increased product prices, he added. Edited excepts:
Is there is a structural problem behind the current downturn in automobile sales?
The per capita income in India is almost around $2,200 (per annum) and in Europe, it is approximately around $40,000. In terms of all the standards which add to the cost of the product, there is no difference between Europe and India. In addition to which the taxation levels in India, whether it’s in terms of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), road tax and others, are much higher than in Europe or even China for that matter. How do you expect a country with such a low per capita income to have enough customers to have the capacity to pay this kind of money for a car and grow at 10-15% every year (in terms of vehicle sales). Why do we want at this stage of our development to adopt all the western standards and norms without considering its impact on the affordability of products?
How will the auto sector perform in the next five years?
We want contribution from manufacturing (sector) to reach 25% of GDP by 2025 and today, it is may be around 15% of the GDP. That means manufacturing sector needs to grow faster than the overall GDP to reach the desired target. If GDP growth itself has to grow by 12% a year to reach the $5 trillion target, then manufacturing will have to grow by something around 17-18%. To grow manufacturing at that rate, then demand for manufactured products also must increase at that rate because unless the customers can buy the product, then the production cannot happen. As automobiles are 50% of the manufacturing GDP, then the sector has to grow by 15-16% per year to propel manufacturing sector to reach 25% of GDP. If customers cannot buy products at this rate, then how will it happen? We have economists everywhere, but where have they worked out this affordability and growth related to affordability?
Do you think emergence of shared mobility has impacted sales?
The reality is that everybody will like to have a car. If you have just started a job or just completed a year in a profession, that salary does not allow you to have everything you want. If you buy a car in the beginning of your career then you have to pay the monthly instalments. So, I have to choose what I want to do with the limited amount of money that I get because for buying a car, I may get a loan but have to provide 10% to 20% initial deposit and also pay the EMI. That cuts into my ability to do some of the other things I want. Today, a youngster wants to buy a nice smartphone and wants to meet his friends at a restaurant and have a good time. If he buys a car, then he probably can’t do these things. So, he is now looking at an option which he didn’t two, three or four years ago—that let me not buy a car to start with and get the other gadgets that I want. So, he postpones his car-buying by four or five years or whatever time it takes him to reach a stage where he is comfortable owning a car. Today, a youngster has so many options of what he can do with his money, that a lot of them prefer other options than buying a car because he can still get his mobility through a car from Ola and Uber which is much more economical. So, what the finance minister said is 100% correct. That is what the millennial generation is thinking.
Has the Gujarat plant been commissioned at a wrong time given the protracted slowdown?
We needed the capacity and earlier, we were short of capacity and there were cars on waiting list all the time. Problem starts from people not buying and doesn’t start from production. The over or excess production has happened because there is a slowdown. Manufacturers take time to bring down production and now everyone is facing non-production days because we have all ordered inventory and parts. There is a whole chain that is in motion which just does not stop.
Having seen Maruti evolve as one of the most valuable corporate entities in this country, how do you think the company will evolve in this coming decade given the disruption in the industry?
My worry is how we will create the capacity amongst Indian consumers to buy manufactured products in large numbers. I don’t think 10 years ahead that way. There is need for our economists to do a study on what policy of pricing and taxation are required, taxation particularly, both by the states and in fact, more by the states, and for input cost of the industry to bring down the cost of production of manufactured products. For example, electricity has been priced at the highest to the industry. How does industry make products which are affordable? If you don’t have affordable products, then how will we have 15% growth?
What do you think of impact of new ways of owning car which is through leasing and subscription?
None of this is of any great significance. They all have some impact. First thing is the consumer must have the ability to buy a product. Nothing is more important that.
Some of your competitors have picked up stakes in various startups in the recent past. When can we expect something on the same lines from Maruti?
How does that make any difference to the growth of the industry? By investing in Ola and Uber, you are not growing the demand for the product. These are all ways to look at how to improve your business but will not help increase the overall demand for cars in the country. That’s a question of a strategy from each manufacturer as to whether they think that it will help the business becoming more competitive. Each company has its own strategy. At the moment, we haven’t invested in any of these sharing platforms and one can argue that these companies will buy products not because somebody is an equity investor but because the particular product is most economical for them to operate in that business. We sell a lot of cars to Uber and Ola. I have no stake in them but they do buy my cars.
Why is the automobile industry divided when it comes to demanding a GST cut on vehicles?
There is no division and Siam has said that a cut is needed. My point is different in a sense that I don’t want a temporary cut. Many people have talked of a temporary cut and that does not help. My bigger question is which I would like the economists in the finance and other ministries to work out that if the auto industry has to grow, what will be the growth rate that they would like the industry to achieve. For that, what will be the pricing structure? It not only includes just taxes bit, also cost of production due to the cost of inputs, infrastructure or compliances.

Times Now
At the trailer launch of his upcoming film Made In China, Bollywood actor Rajkummar Rao had an emotional moment after he was asked about his late father. The actor was asked as to how is he coping with his father's demise, to which, Rajkummar had an emotional response. The actor tried to fight back his tears as he answered the question.
In the photographs, that have now been shared on social media, we see an emotional Rajkummar trying to put a strong front while answering the question. 
The actor's father Satyapal Yadav passed away earlier this month. He was 60 years old.
Opening up about his father's demise, Rajkummar shared that it's a loss that stays with you. He recalled how he resumed the work when his mother passed away during the shoot of Newton and shared that after his father's death, he got back to the sets of Roohi Afza on the next day itself. "Because my parents are really proud of me for being an actor, and that's the only thing they wanted me to do, which gave them so much happiness," he said at the trailer launch. 
 
 
He further shared how he made his father watch the trailer of Made In China in the hospital. "But, I am so glad, when my father was in the hospital and the trailer was just getting ready. I requested Dinoo (producer) and I asked him I want to show my trailer to my father because you know... the doctors were saying things. He was so kind, he sent me the link... and I was so happy, he saw the trailer. And I am sure he will watch the film as well, his blessings are there," said an emotional Rajkummar.  
Rajkummar's father was unwell and was admitted in a hospital for over 17 days. He breathed his last on September 5 and the last rites were performed in Gurugram and he was cremated in the presence of his closest friends and family members. 
 
 
But Rajkummar, dedicated to his professional commitments, is back at his work with the promotions of his upcoming film. On the film front, Made In China, co-starring Mouni Roy, is slated to release on October 25. The actor, along with his co-star, answered all the questions related to the film during the media interactions at an event held in Mumbai. 
 
 
Post Made In China, Rajkummar will also grace the big screen in Hansal Mehta's Turram Khan and Hardik Mehta's Roohi Afza.

Chunky Panday will next be seen in Prasthanam. The actor worked in several films with Govinda in his peak years and even delivered a blockbuster with Aankhen, which was directed by David Dhawan. While Govinda and Chunky's camaraderie is definitely missed on-screen today, we asked Chunky on the two sharing screen space again perhaps in Aankhen 2, if at all it is ever made. To this, Chunky, in an exclusive chat with PINKVILLA said, "I would love Aankhen 2 to happen. I would have Govinda and I play these two brothers and having kids who can take it forward. It would be a great combination."
Chunky added, "I get very excited when I see Govinda on-screen. I love him. What a great actor, there is no better actor than him in the country. He is outstanding. Even his recent body of work, whatever he is doing, I find him really entertaining." Interestingly, we mentioned Govinda claiming that the actor did not receive his dues in the film industry. To this, a baffled Chunky stated, "Why? He has ruled it. There was a time when Shah Rukh Khan was giving all those big hits and then Govinda was also giving hits along with him. He has ruled it since like 1991, from say Shola Aur Shabnam till mid-2000s, from there he hasn’t looked back I think. He has had the greatest run."
He concluded, "He has enjoyed great superstardom. He has got his dues. But we want to see him more. To stand up against Amitabh Bachchan in 'Bade Miyan Chote Miyan', you need to be a good actor to be able to do that. I am a Big B fan. I have learnt so much from Govinda."

He has already had two releases in this year – Kesari and Mission Mangal. Both films created magic on the box office and garnered moolah.

Times Now
Lapote County, Indiana: A truck loaded with 44,000 pounds (19,958 kilograms) of Nutella cocoa spread flipped on a highway in Indiana on Monday. The incident happened on I-94 near the Indiana/Michigan border around 9:30 pm.
The truck driver, Chuhar Singh, told the Indiana State Police that the truck flipped after a car in front of him slammed its breaks unexpectedly.
Singh said that he tried to avoid a collision with the car, however, he lost control of his vehicle. The highway was closed for about 2.5 hours after the accident. Singh was not injured in the incident.
"The crash also resulted in the semi losing approximately 150 gallons of diesel in the median," the police said in a statement.

However, this was not the first time that chocolate spilt on the roadway. In January this year, about 3,500 gallons of liquid chocolate rolled over in Arizona.
In another incident, an armoured truck's door came open on a Georgia highway spilling $1,75,000 cash across the road in July. Passersby had managed to catch hold of plenty of the spilt cash even before the police arrived. Officers along with the truck crew then gathered a few hundred dollars that were left.
The police had said that it was theft of lost or mislaid property and requested people to return the money. "While we certainly understand the temptation, it's still theft and the money should be returned," the police had said. Some people later approached the police to return the money the grabbed from the highway.

Cricket Australia
Australia captain Tim Paine has revealed he broke his thumb during the fifth Ashes Test, while he's praised paceman Peter Siddle for bowling through the pain of a hip injury for most of the match.
The Test skipper has also revealed he won't be available to play in the KFC BBL this summer as he looks to focus on playing red-ball cricket.
England won the fifth Test at The Oval this week to level the five-match series at 2-2, although Australia retained the Ashes urn as the holders of the famous old trophy.
To add to the disappointment of losing the match in south London, Paine had to play through the pain of a busted thumb.
"My thumb was broken towards the end of that Test but it is not displaced, so I should be right to get back into training early," Paine wrote in his column for The Australian.
It is not known exactly when or how Paine suffered the injury or whether it's his right or left thumb.
The Test skipper was not selected for Tasmania’s opening two Marsh Cup games next week as the majority of Australia’s Ashes squad were given a well-earned break, but he's expected to feature for the Tigers in the lead-up to Australia's first Test of the home summer, against Pakistan in November.
Paine famously required seven separate operations on his right index finger after it was broken during an exhibition match in 2010, almost ending his career prematurely.
He also suffered a hairline fracture in his right thumb during the Johannesburg Test last year, his first as captain
In his column, Paine also touched on the hip injury suffered by Siddle on the opening day of the Test, which the Victorian hinted at during the match.
"Peter Siddle tore a hip flexor bowling on the first morning," Paine wrote.
"He has copped a bit of criticism for not bowling as well as he we know he can, but the team knows just how heroic he was. A lot of other people wouldn’t have bowled again in the match, but he pushed on because he didn’t want to leave Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to do extra work. He’s a warrior, Sidds, and we love him deeply for that."
Siddle was picked ahead of Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson for the Oval Test and was uncharacteristically expensive on the opening day, conceding 0-61 from 17 overs in the first innings.
He also leaked four-runs-an-over in the second innings, although he did pick up the key wickets of Joe Denly for 94 and Jos Buttler for 47.
"I hurt my hip early on day one, so it’s been a bit of a graft in the last couple of days," Siddle told the BBC after day three.
"It’s been hard work, but it’s a Test match, you do what you can do and you stay out there."
It is understood Siddle's injury, like Paine's, is not overly serious and he's expected to be available to play for Victoria next month.
Paine said while playing Big Bash cricket for the Hobart Hurricanes is not on his radar for this season, he's keen to return to the 20-over game once his Test career is over.
"I’m keen to see just how far we can take this (Test) team and I’ve decided to give up the BBL so I can concentrate on red ball cricket and being in the best place to lead them," he wrote.
"Being captain is draining and I think I should take every chance to recharge my batteries.
"I’ll go back to the BBL when I’m finished, but for now my focus is on my main job."

Reuters
PARIS (Reuters) - Angel Di Maria scored twice in a vintage performance to help Paris St Germain outclass Real Madrid 3-0 in their opening Champions League Group A game on Wednesday. 
In the absence of the formidable attacking trio of Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Edinson Cavani, Di Maria provided two first-half goals as PSG suffocated Real throughout and Thomas Meunier added a third in stoppage time. 
Real, European champions 13 times and three years in a row from 2016-18, failed to muster a shot on target and suffered their first defeat of the season. 
PSG lead the standings on three points, ahead of Club Brugge and Galatasaray, who played out a goalless draw earlier on Wednesday. 
“We lacked intensity, we never got into the game, we created very few chances,” Real coach Zinedine Zidane told a news conference. 
Although PSG’s win could be seen as a statement, the French champions still have a long way to go before putting three consecutive last-16 eliminations behind them for good including last season’s embarrassing defeat by Manchester United. 
“We played at a very very high level tonight, but it’s not easy to show this in every game,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. 
With Neymar suspended and Mbappe and Cavani injured, Argentine Mauro Icardi started up front after playing his first half hour for PSG in a Ligue 1 game against Strasbourg last weekend. 
He had little impact, though, as Di Maria made sure his compatriot’s lack of match time went unnoticed in PSG’s first European game since a shock 3-1 home defeat by United sent them out of last season’s Champions League.  
Eden Hazard started for Real, who eliminated PSG in the last 16 in 2017-18, and they were also without the injured Marcelo, Isco, Luka Modric, Marco Asensio and Fede Valverde as well as the suspended Sergio Ramos and Nacho Fernandez. 
PSG started fast and were rewarded for their early domination in the 14th minute when Di Maria stabbed the ball past Thibaut Courtois at the near post from Juan Bernat’s cross. 
It was former Real player Di Maria’s 25th goal in his 100th appearance in European competition. 
He made it 26 in the 33rd minute, curling a superb shot past Courtois from 20 metres after Idrissa Gueye had cut through the Real midfield. 
Real forward Gareth Bale found the back of the net shortly afterwards but the goal was ruled out by the VAR for handball. 
PSG left little space to Real and Di Maria came close to making it 3-0, only for his chip to land on the roof of the net after the Argentine had been sent through by the impressive Gueye. 
Real striker Karim Benzema beat Keylor Navas from close range in the 77th minute, but the goal was ruled out because Lucas Vazquez was offside. 
Full back Meunier wrapped up an emphatic win when he scored from close range one minute into stoppage time following a PSG counter-attack.

In an in-depth interview with UK TV personality Piers Morgan, Ronaldo opened up on his huge fame, success and family life.
One of the questions football fan Morgan asked was for Ronaldo to pick the best of his more than 700 senior career goals.
The prolific Portugal ace chose the stunning overhead kick he scored while playing for Real Madrid against current club Juventus in the Champions League quarterfinal first leg in 2018.
“I tried to score this goal for many, many years. I had scored 700-odd goals but I hadn’t done this. I thought ‘finally I had scored a bicycle, the beautiful jumping,’" Ronaldo told Morgan.
“The way I had done against Buffon, against Juventus, in the Champions League. It was a beautiful goal,” he added.
When Morgan probed as to whether it was better than sex, Ronaldo replied with a laugh: “No, not with my Geo, no.”
Ronaldo, 34, described Spanish model Rodriguez as "the love of his life" and also said he plans to marry the 25-year-old, with whom he has a young daughter. The footballer also has three other children from surrogate mothers.
In other parts of the interview, broadcast on ITV, Ronaldo discussed his immense wealth, said by some estimates to be in the region of half a billion dollars.
When Morgan asked the footballer whether that was right, Ronaldo replied: “I think so, I hope so. I think that might be too much.
“I am not 100 percent but what I can say is I have good money in the bank.”
Ronaldo discussed the rape allegations against him, which he said had caused him "embarrassment" and which he has always denied. 
He also broke down in tears when shown a clip of his late father praising him, with Ronaldo expressing regret that he had not lived to see many of his achievements, after dying of liver failure aged 52 more than a decade ago, following a battle with alcoholism.

Engadget
You might have rolled your eyes when Apple mentioned that the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro could do "slofies," but the company is taking things slightly more seriously.  Apple has applied to the USPTO for a trademark on the term "Slofie" in terms of "downloadable computer software for use in capturing and recording video."  Don't worry, it's not trying to own the cultural landscape -- rather, this is largely to prevent app developers and phone makers from 'borrowing' the term for their own features.
The company doesn't refer to the clips as "slofies" outside of its marketing for the new iPhones.  It's not that heavily invested in the concept, thankfully.  However, the trademark application is something of a hedge.  It doesn't want to be caught off-guard if the term ever catches on.  Not that we'd expect it to -- "slofie" is about as likely to happen as "fetch" was in Mean Girls.

India.com
United Nations: India was the leading country of origin of international migrants in 2019 with a 17.5 million strong diaspora, according to new estimates released by the United Nations, which said the number of migrants globally reached an estimated 272 million.
The International Migrant Stock 2019, a dataset released by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) today, provides the latest estimates of the number of international migrants by age, sex and origin for all countries and areas of the world.
The estimates are based on official national statistics on the foreign-born or the foreign population obtained from population censuses, population registers or nationally representative surveys.
The report said that the top 10 countries of origin account for one-third of all international migrants. In 2019, with 17.5 million persons living abroad, India was the leading country of origin of international migrants.
Migrants from Mexico constituted the second largest diaspora (11.8 million), followed by China (10.7 million), Russia (10.5 million), Syria (8.2 million), Bangladesh (7.8 million), Pakistan (6.3 million), Ukraine (5.9 million), the Philippines (5.4 million) and Afghanistan (5.1 million).
India hosted 5.1 million international migrants in 2019, less than the 5.2 million in 2015. International migrants as a share of total population in India was steady at 0.4 per cent from 2010 to 2019.
The country hosted 207,000 refugees, the report said adding that refugees as a share of international migrants in the country was four per cent.
Among the international migrants in the country, the female population was 48.8 per cent and the median age of international migrants was 47.1 years. In India, the highest number of international migrants came from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal.
In 2019, regionally, Europe hosted the largest number of international migrants (82 million), followed by Northern America (59 million) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (49 million).
At the country level, about half of all international migrants reside in just 10 countries, with the United States of America hosting the largest number of international migrants (51 million), equal to about 19 per cent of the world’s total.
Germany and Saudi Arabia host the second and third largest numbers of migrants (13 million each), followed by Russia (12 million), the United Kingdom (10 million), the United Arab Emirates (9 million), France, Canada and Australia (around 8 million each) and Italy (6 million).
The share of international migrants in total population varies considerably across geographic regions with the highest proportions recorded in Oceania (including Australia and New Zealand) (21.2 per cent) and Northern America (16.0 per cent) and the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean (1.8 per cent), Central and Southern Asia (1.0 per cent) and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (0.8 per cent).
A majority of international migrants in sub-Saharan Africa (89 per cent), Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (83 per cent), Latin America and the Caribbean (73 per cent), and Central and Southern Asia (63 per cent) originated from the region in which they reside.
By contrast, most of the international migrants that lived in Northern America (98 per cent), Oceania (88 per cent) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (59 per cent) were born outside their region of residence.
UN Under-Secretary-General for DESA Liu Zhenmin said that These data are critical for understanding the important role of migrants and migration in the development of both countries of origin and destination.
Facilitating orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people will contribute much to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
The report added that forced displacements across international borders continues to rise.
Between 2010 and 2017, the global number of refugees and asylum seekers increased by about 13 million, accounting for close to a quarter of the increase in the number of all international migrants.
Northern Africa and Western Asia hosted around 46 per cent of the global number of refugees and asylum seekers, followed by sub-Saharan Africa (21 per cent).
Turning to the gender composition, women comprise slightly less than half of all international migrants in 2019.
The share of women and girls in the global number of international migrants fell slightly, from 49 per cent in 2000 to 48 per cent in 2019.
The share of migrant women was highest in Northern America (52 per cent) and Europe (51 per cent), and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa (47 per cent) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (36 per cent).
In terms of age, one out of every seven international migrants is below the age of 20 years.

The News Minute
BJP MLA Raja Singh from Hyderabad has announced the creation of a vigilante army to ‘deal with’ traitors and ‘send them to hell’. In two videos released on Wednesday, the always-controversial, often-bigoted legislator proudly claimed that he is currently holding a conference discussing the formation of this vigilante army.
Raja Singh in his video said, “Six months back, we had planned a camp, decided on a date, and invited Hinduvadi bravehearts and patriots to attend the camp. There’s a great discussion underway at this camp (now). A pledge has been taken at this camp that every youngster in India will be trained to become a soldier; India is safe because of our Army, similarly the Indian youth will be readied like an Army soldier. If India needs it in the coming days, the Indian youngsters should not fall behind. The Army is taking care of traitors on the outside. But there should also be an army to take care of the terrorists inside the house right? So that army is now being readied.”
“This army will be created in every corner of India. In the coming days, whichever traitor is hidden inside India, will be dragged out and worn down, and sent outside India – or even directly to Jahannum (hell),” Raja Singh threatened, “This is our pledge, this is our programme.”
“This programme will go on for seven more days, and we will continue to have great discussions,” he said, hinting that this diabolical vigilante army was only the beginning of his anti-national activities.
In another video released on the same day, he said, “We have a determination/commitment towards Hindu rashtra, for this Hindu rashtra, we need an army. How can this army be formed? All over India, we are forming an army for Hindu rashtra, the protection of dharma and the nation. For this, there's a ten day camp for which we have come to Bengaluru.”
While one of the videos was uploaded to his Facebook page, the other was shared through WhatsApp. 
The exact location of this camp in Bengaluru is unclear. When TNM asked Raja Singh, he refused to divulge the location, but said that 470 people were participating in the event and that the camp would continue till September 24.
As per his latest election affidavit, Raja Singh has 43 police cases against him. 
Recently, the Ghoshamahal MLA tried to stoke communal tensions in Hyderabad, when he tried erecting a huge statue of freedom fighter Rani Avanti Bai at Jumerat Bazar without permission from the authorities. The incident led to tension in the area. Initially the BJP claimed that police lathicharged the BJP supporters, leaving Raja Singh injured. However, a video showing the MLA hitting himself with a stone busted their claim.

“Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are some of the finest batsmen that India has seen and have proven to be one of India’s best opening pairs. Shikhar Dhawan’s contribution to the game is as important as that of Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli,” Harbhajan, an expert on Star Sports, said.

“Be it T20 or 50 overs, irrespective of the format, Shikhar is really good. According to me, there is no better opener than Shikhar Dhawan, along with Rohit Sharma, in any format – T20 and 50 overs. If he continues working on his fitness in the coming 2-3 years, I think he will be unstoppable,” he added.
Former Indian player Irfan Pathan, meanwhile, said Ravindra Jadeja is a quality back-up allrounder for India and in Hardik Pandya‘s absence he can do a good job.
“Ravindra Jadeja’s innings have been crucial in the IPL and ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. We need to keep this in mind, because Hardik Pandya is a fast-bowling all-rounder, and they tend to get injured,” Pathan said.

“India needs to have a back-up all-rounder who can replace Hardik and bowl to his calibre. We should get Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja to play on the 6th spot and I am sure they will do the job.
“Jadeja is one of the best spin allrounders in the team whose capabilities in fielding, bowling and batting are remarkable. He is a brilliant cricketer and has proven himself multiple times.”

Since the first match of the three-match T20 series got called off due to rain, both teams would aim to put in their best effort in Mohali as they know that the winner would not lose the rubber. With the stakes so high, there is, therefore, not much scope for mistakes by either of the teams.
Kohli and Co would be brimming with confidence following their superb show against the West Indies in their recent tour. India were absolutely ruthless against the West Indies, with only rain denying them a clean sweep of the Test, ODI and T20 series contested between the two teams.

The Financial Express
Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Wednesday said that instead of taking over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) by force, the development in Jammu and Kashmir should prompt the people on the other side of Line of Control (LoC) to “revolt” and join India.
Addressing a function here, Malik said that some ministers have been talking about taking back PoK from Pakistan by force.
“I have been seeing from the past 10 to 15 days that many of our ministers, who do not get to talk on international matters, have been repeatedly talking about invading PoK, taking it back etc. My belief is that if PoK is the next target, we can take it on the basis on the development of Jammu and Kashmir.
“If we can give love and respect to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and secure the future of their children, bring development and prosperity, I can guarantee that within a year or so there will be a revolt in PoK and you will get it without a confrontation … the residents of PoK will on their own say that they want to come this side. This is my roadmap for PoK,” the governor said.
Malik urged the countrymen to treat people from Kashmir with love and respect and said officers have been placed in every state to help Kashmiri students.
“There are 22,000 Kashmiri students studying in different states of the country and they should be treated love. People of Kashmir should be treated with love and respect,” he added.
Referring to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) registering cases to probe the alleged irregularities in the Roshni scheme, he said it apparently turned out to be a Rs 25,000 crore scam.
“The implementation of the scheme has been such that it has proved to be a Rs 25,000 crore scam … When I came here, the first thing I did was to end the Roshni scheme and we handed the Roshni cases to the ACB for investigation,” he said.
The Jammu and Kashmir government in 1996 launched the scheme to vest land ownership rights on people who were occupying state land by paying a part of its assessed value towards the public exchequer. The aim of the scheme was to regularise illegal occupants while generating funds for construction of power projects in the state.
Malik said the government has taken steps to ensure uninterrupted power supply to Jammu and Srinagar cities from this winter.
The governor thanked Union Power Minister R K Singh, who was also present in the function, for his generous support to the power sector in the state.
“At my request, he (Singh) has reduced the time for laying of Leh-Nubra transmission line from three years to 18 months,” he added.
The governor and the Union minister inaugurated 15 power projects in Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh and laid the foundation stone for another 20 projects in these regions of the state that was bifurcated into two union territories on August 5.

Singh, in his address, stressed that the power supply in this winter will be much better than in the past.
“We will spend time in Jammu in December and January to experience and observe the situation … our goal is to provide 24 hours electricity supply to all the citizens of the country, including Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh,” he said.
Singh said the regions have the potential to generate enough hydel power, not only be self-sufficient but also to export it to other states.
“This will enhance the per capita income of the state like it did in Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand,” he added.

The Quint
Video Editor: Varun Sharma
Jharkhand Police on Wednesday, 18 September, reinstated the charge of murder, Section 302 of the IPC, in lynch mob victim Tabrez Ansari’s case following The Quint’s exclusive report of it being dropped in the charge sheet, submitted on 29 July.
They moved court for this addition in a supplementary charge sheet filed on 18 September.
Reacting to the murder charge being reinstated, Ansari’s wife Shahista told The Quint: “I am very happy that this has happened. Some faith in the administration and investigative agencies has been restored. This is great news for us. They (the accused) deserve the strictest punishment.”
Speaking to news agency ANI, she said that she has faith in god and will only smile when the perpetrators are hanged.
In this supplementary charge sheet, the police has said that initially they dropped the murder charge on the basis of the post-mortem report but added it after they found out that the viral video of the lynching was not tampered with. This video was then used as evidence to file murder charges against the accused. The police not only filed murder charges against the eleven initial accused but against two additional men taking the total accused in the case to thirteen.
The two additions are Vikram Mandal and Atul Mehli. The eleven accused earlier have been identified as Prakash Mandal alias Pappu Mandal, Kamal Mahato, Sunamo Pradhan, Premchand Mahali, Sumant Mahato, Madan Nayak, Chamu Nayak, Mahesh Mahali, Kushal Mahali, Satyanarayan Nayak and Bhim Sen Mandal.

Ansari’s wife had demanded a CBI inquiry into the incident saying she did not have faith in the investigation by the district police. Speaking to The Quint, their lawyer, Altaf Hussain said, “This is a strong move by the police and it is great news, however the demand for a CBI inquiry stays on.”
He further told ANI that it was the medical report due to which the case went in the wrong direction. Hussain added that the medical report clearly shows that there was a fracture on the skull, while the complaint says that he died of a heart attack.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said on Wednesday the attack on the kingdom’s oil infrastructure posed a “real test of the global will” to confront subversive acts that threaten international stability, state media reported. 
His remarks were made in a telephone call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who called on the global community to “take a firm stand and resolute action” towards such assaults, Saudi state news agency SPA said in an Arabic-language statement. 
The Sept. 14 attack on two oil plants initially halved Saudi Arabia’s oil production, cutting 5% of global output.

RT
Speaking to the press on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Saudi Ministry of Defense displayed what he said was wreckage from the projectiles used in the strikes on petrol plants in Abqaiq and Khurais last weekend.
The type of weapons used proved that the assault “could not have originated in Yemen,” Colonel Turki al-Maliki claimed. He said the capabilities of the drones and the cruise missiles have been known to Riyadh from previous attacks.
Accusing Iran of sponsoring the attack, the spokesman called on other countries to “acknowledge Iran's malign activities in the region.”
The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran.
He also presented surveillance footage from one of the oil facilities, claiming it depicted a drone in flight, though the UAV was difficult to make out in the video.
It wasn’t clear where precisely the attack originated, al-Maliki admitted. He said the government was “working to know exactly the launch point.”
The press conference came just as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Jeddah, where he is scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the attacks.
Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the drone and missile strikes on Saturday, which caused a severe disruption in global oil markets and sent prices soaring upward by nearly 20 percent. The damaged refinery in Abqaiq was among the world’s largest oil processing facilities, while the Khurais plant sits on the country’s second largest oil field.
The missile used in the attack could be a copy of the Soviet-designed cruise missile Kh-55, which Iran acquired from Ukraine and then developed into its own weapon, a military analyst and retired army officer Viktor Murakhovsky told RT.
However, this does not qualify as definitive proof that Iran launched such an attack, Murakhovsky said. It is “hardly a secret” that Iran sells weapons to the Yemeni Houthi rebels, he explained, adding that Tehran has spoken in support of Yemen’s right of self-defense.
Moreover, it is not difficult for Houthi forces to launch a cruise missile, so their responsibility cannot be ruled out.
“You do not need a narrow-focus specialist in order to use this missile. You need to input the launch mission data and carry out the launch, that’s all,” Murakhovsky said.
Doubling down on their claim of responsibility, the Houthis on Wednesday said that the strikes were launched from “three positions,” and added that the drones used would be “revealed today for the first time.”
Meanwhile, Tehran officials have dismissed the arguments presented at the Saudi press-conference as inconclusive.
The Saudi press conference was a “media disaster” for the country, said Hesameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, arguing the kingdom could not prove “what area and point [the strikes] were fired from,” or “why the air defense failed to thwart the attack.”

The Financial Express
Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and targeted him over the prevailing economic situation in the country. In an apparent reference to PM Modi’s “Howdy, Modi!” event in Houston,US, Rahul Gandhi asked PM Modi how is the economy doing. “Howdy economy doin’, Mr Modi? Ain’t too good it seems,” Rahul Gandhi tweeted.
India’s GDP growth slipped to 6-year low of 5 per cent in June quarter as compared to 5.8 per cent in the previous quarter, according to the latest economic data. The slower growth rate combined with slump in manufacturing output, weak consumer demand and deceleration in private investment has indicated towards increasing slowdown in the Indian economy.
PM Modi, who is set to address the “Howdy, Modi!” event in Houston on September 22, during his upcoming America visit, will be joined by the US President Donald Trump. The Houston event will be the first time a US president and Indian Prime Minister will be addressing a joint rally. The event will also feature US lawmakers, prominent Indian Americans and 400 artistes who will present a cultural show. The three-hour “Howdy, Modi!” has been organised at NRG Stadium in Houston, one of the largest in Texas and has already garnered 50,000 registrations online, with many more on the waiting list.
Congress has been taking on the Modi government and criticising the government’s economic policies.
Earlier in the day, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra trained his guns at PM Modi for his international event, saying foreign events would not help get investors to salvage the economy.
Taking to Twitter, Priyanka Gandhi said, “Chanting 5 trillion every day or managing media headlines will not improve the Indian economy. Events organised abroad will not help get investors. Investor confidence has taken a hit but the government does not want to accept the reality. This slowdown is a speed-breaker in the country’s path to becoming an economic superpower.”
On Monday, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi described US President Donald Trump joining Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Howdy, Modi!” event in the words of British singer Elton John. “I think performers are all show-offs anyway. Unless you show off, you’re not going to get noticed – Elton John,” Singhvi said.

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court has quashed a 2004 sexual harassment case filed against angel investor Mahesh Murthy, noting that the reason for delay in filing the case 14 years later is not "properly explained".
Following a complaint filed by a woman, the suburban Bandra Police had registered the case against Murthy in March 2018 under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 354 (sexual harassment) and 509 (outraging the modesty of a woman).
The woman alleged that in February 2004, when she met Murthy at a coffee shop here, he touched her inappropriately and kissed her against her will.
Murthy approached the high court earlier this month after a magistrate took cognizance of the charge sheet filed in the case.
In his plea, Murthy claimed that criminal law places a limitation on when certain offences can be filed and Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure bars a court from taking cognizance after lapse of the period of limitation.
In cases lodged under IPC Sections 354 and 509, the limitation period is three years.
After hearing arguments, a division bench of Justices Ranjit More and N J Jamadar noted that the magistrate, after expiry of the period of limitation, could not have taken cognizance of the charge sheet.
"We have perused the order taking cognizance by the magistrate concerned, and we find that neither there is an application by the prosecution for extension of limitation or condonation of delay nor there are reasons for condoning such a delay by the magistrate," the court said in its order passed last week.
The bench held that continuation of prosecution of Murthy would be "abuse of the process of law".
"The allegation against the petitioner that he is a serial sexual offender would not be relevant to examine the validity and legality of the criminal proceedings pending before the learned magistrate," the court said.
Murthy is co-founder of Seedfund and founder and chief executive officer of Pinstorm Technologies Private Limited, a pay-for-performance digital brand management firm.

		             HYDERABAD :
"It’s Still Day 1." Jeff Bezos’ famous words, painted on a white wall, greet the 6,000-odd Amazon employees every day as they swipe their IDs to enter the e-commerce company’s biggest office in Hyderabad’s financial district, Gachibowli. The words are a constant reminder of the billionaire’s core ideas of a successful startup: be obsessed with the customer, focus on results over process, quickly make high-quality decisions and embrace outside trends early on.
If that’s not enough, the interiors of the building—which can house 15,000 people, is spread across 9.5 acres, and has 2.5 times more steel than the Eiffel Tower—are splashed with Bezos’ core beliefs in art, text and pictures.
That’s just one focus area of Amazon’s largest office building in the world, though.
Each of the 12 floors has a separate theme that showcases the diversity of India—from art and culture to languages and movies—and blends it with the company’s ideals. Think a collage of mandalas placed together like the Buddhist prayer wheels to create a 5ft artwork, and a line below it reading, “Separate parts come together to make a whole." Or a cut-out of “The Empty Chair" with a paisley pattern, pasted on a wall in a way that it gives a 3D effect, representing the “invisible but always present customer who makes the company more resilient". (As a tradition, Amazon meetings across the world have an empty chair, representing the customer.)
“We had three things in mind when we started working on this building. Amazon’s core principles, the work Amazon is doing in India and the diversity of India," says an Amazon India spokesperson, who wishes to remain anonymous.
It’s all about work
Each floor has about 1,000 workstations and hundreds more, what my tour guide called, “work points". There’s never an opportunity to not work. Most spaces in building have “work points", where employees can sit, in a group or solo, and work with their laptops. “We have actually seen their productivity increase when they are not sitting at the workstations," says the guide.
If they want to take a break from work or simply stretch, there are billiard tables, yoga rooms, and areas dedicated to cricket and wall climbing. “The playing helps," says a 25-year-old who works in the data team. “Whenever I get stuck with an idea, I come and play cricket. It refreshes me."
The cafeteria spread across the second floor is another hit with employees, for it offers a variety of cuisines, including Oriental, Italian, north and south Indian and “home-like" food, at reasonable prices. Work points follow them in the canteen as well.
The belief that “ideas can pop up anywhere" is so deeply embedded in the Amazon office design that even the 49 elevators, which move one floor per second, have whiteboards installed. There are Huddle Rooms on each floor, where people can sit together and ideate and discuss, scrum areas, with tall tables and chairs and work points, right next to the workstation areas, and Focus Rooms, where employees can peel themselves away from distractions and concentrate in isolation.
“We wanted to create a seamless experience, whether you are an Amazon worker in the US or the UK. Our designs are based on our global standards," claims the India spokesperson. But why Hyderabad, and not Bengaluru, India’s Silicon Valley, or Delhi-NCR, the newest hotspot for startups and unicorns in the country? “One-third of Amazon employees are based here. So it makes sense."

Free Press Journal
Shahjahanpur: The law student, who has accused BJP leader Chinmayanand of rape and blackmail, has now questioned the delay on part of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in arresting the accused. She asked if the Uttar Pradesh government was waiting for her to end her life to initiate action against the former central minister.
 "It has been over 15 days since I recorded my statement and gave the SIT necessary evidence. However, no action has been taken against the accused. The SIT is out to protect him," the victim said. "Maybe the government wants us to end our lives and only then they will take action against Chinmayanand. Will the authorities believe me when I attempt suicide?" the law student asked.
According to the victim, she has given all the evidence against former Union Minister Chinmayanand in the case and yet no action has been taken against the BJP leader. The woman had recorded her statement before a magistrate here on Monday. 
After recording her statement, she had said: "I have told the magistrate about the rape complaint I gave in New Delhi, my missing spectacles and a chip from the hostel room. I also  informed about the bedding and liquor bottles, which were removed from the Chinmayanand's room," she said. The former Union minister, meanwhile, remains under medical observation after he fell ill on Monday night.

Times Now
Muzaffarnagar: In a glaring security lapse, employees of the government owned-United Bank of India, allegedly forgot to lock the bank and left it open after a day's work on Tuesday evening. 
The matter came to light after a passer-by spotted the opened gates of the bank and informed the police. After this, the cops rushed to the spot and secured the bank. Police officials also called the bank manager to the spot. 
Later, the manager and other staff reached the bank and locked it up. The bank manager in a written admission acknowledged that the bank remained open and left unattended from 7.30 pm to 10 pm on September 17. 
Fortunately, nothing was found missing from the bank. When the media approached the bank manager about the incident, he refused to answer any questions. An investigation has been ordered into the lapse. 
"The bank was left open due to the negligence of the bank employees. A big tragedy could have taken place. The moment police got to know of the incident, the area Station House Officer rushed to the spot. We are thoroughly investigating the matter and have sought clarification from the bank's manager. We will take action against those found guilty of negligence," said Satpal Antil, SP, Muzaffarnagar.
In another incident, five armed men decamped with Rs 19 lakh after holding employees of a bank in Udaipur hostage at gunpoint on Monday. The incident took place at the Madri Industrial Area branch of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and was caught on closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed inside the facility.
Superintendent of Police (Udaipur) Kailash Bishnoi said that all five men's faces can be seen in CCTV footage retrieved from the branch. He further said that police stations across the state were alerted and checkpoints set up to nab the suspects at the earliest. The robbery took place around 1:30 pm on the afternoon of September 16.
In the video, five armed men can be seen barging into the branch and holding everyone present there hostage. They manage to flee with reportedly Rs 19 lakh. It is believed that they cut off the wire of the emergency alarm before entering the branch.

Times Now
Leh: Days after a faceoff between India and Chinese forces in Ladakh sector, Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh presided over a high-altitude warfare military exercise sending out a clear message to China that any misadventure on India's territory would be punished. The Lt Gen visited Eastern Ladakh and witnessed the integrated exercise of all arms in super high altitude area and complimented all ranks for an outstanding display of warfighting capability under challenging conditions.
The XIV Corps which is headquartered at Leh falls under the Northern Army Command and has the 3rd Infantry Division and 8th Infantry Division under it.
The current commander Lieutenant General Yogesh Kumar Joshi is the current commander of the XIV Corps. It was under his leadership that the 13th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles had recaptured the strategic Tiger Hill during Kargil War.
Raised on September 1, 1999, after the Kargil War, Fire and Fury Corps has been entrusted with guarding the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh which borders China.
This military exercise comes after the Indian and Chinese troops engaged in a heated exchange on the northern bank of Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh. However, the skirmish came to an end after holding talks.
As per the sources the incident took place on Wednesday in eastern Ladakh. This face-off comes after ahead of the highly anticipated informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in India in October.
The Chinese Army reportedly objected to patrol carried out by the Indian soldiers in the Pangong Tso lake area which comes under Chinese control.
Briefing the media, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said the matter had been resolved quickly.
"The matter stands resolved. I think what is important to note is that there are existing mechanisms between India and China to resolve such issues," IANS quoted him as saying.
"It means that the mechanisms which exist between India and China are working very well," he further added.
Kumar rejected reports that there was a link between the war game in Arunachal Pradesh in October and the visit of the Chinese president during the same time.
During External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's visit to Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi raised objection over India’s decision to make Ladakh a Union Territory saying that it posed a challenge to China's sovereignty and violated the two countries' agreement on maintaining peace and stability in the border area".
India abrogated Article 370 and later on August 9, President Ram Nath Kovind gave assent to the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, bifurcating the two Union Territories.

A teenager who told co-workers she planned to 'shoot 400  people for fun at her old high school' was arrested after deputies found an AK-47 with six magazines and a 12-gauge shotgun in her bedroom.
Alexis Wilson, 18, has been charged with a felony terrorist hoax after the threat against McAlester High School in Oklahoma.
Pittsburg County Sheriff Morris said a tip led to the investigation where officers found that Wilson had posted videos of her shooting guns.  
Wilson's Pizza Inn co-workers gathered, where she was showing Facebook videos of a newly purchased rifle, the sheriff's reports said.

When police searched Wilson's room in her mother's house, they found an AK-47 with six magazines, and a rifle
McAlester High School had a police presence Monday after the arrest of a former student who threatened to 'shoot up' the building
While showing the video to one of her friends, deputies said Wilson 'shoot 400 people for fun and that there were so many people at her old school that she would like to do it.' 
However, Wilson backtracked on that comment once deputies arrived at her home, telling them it wasn't 'meant to be taken the way that the comment was taken in the situation [Sunday].'
While searching the home, deputies discovered the new AK-47 with multiple magazines as well as a 12-gauge shotgun in Wilson's room. 
Wilson’s mother said during the arraignment that her daughter is innocent, the McAlester News said. According to the sheriff's report, her mother said the teenager 'always shot firearms and hunted,' so when the daughter was saving for the rifle, she didn't think anything of it.

Despite Wilson's arrest, McAlester Public Schools Superintendent Randy Hughes requested additional security at the high school.  
'We went through this last year when we had a threat and it’s the same thing — added security, extra police officers,' Hughes told the McAlester News.
“Every time we get a threat, we take it very seriously,” he added.
Sheriff Chris Morris said Wilson was a 9th grade dropout of McAlester. Asked by deputies if she ever wanted to hurt people at the school, Wilson said she did have that thought in the past, but not recently, the McAlester News said. 
Morris told the DailyMail.com that they have to take this seriously.
'I have kids in school,' Morris said. 
While any on social media said Wilson didn't mean it, Morris said that's not a valid excuse. He said they'd rather investigate ad be overly cautious than not explore it and a worse case scenario happens.

When deputies questioned her about the video, they said Wilson voluntary showed the video and photos holding an AK-47. Her iPhone was seized as evidence. 
Morris said his detectives are in the process of checking the phone and her social media footprint. They are also looking to speak to anyone Wilson may have talked to about this threat or other behavior that could be linked.   
Wilson was taken into custody and transported to the Pittsburg County Jail. 
Pittsburg County Special Judge Mindy Beare set bond at $250,000 and a hearing date for Sept. 27 at Monday's initial appearance arraignment.
'This is something we take very, very serious and there was no time to sit and wait around,' Morris said.

Trump announced O’Brien’s nomination on Wednesday, saying that he has “worked long and hard with Robert.”
O’Brien replaces John Bolton, the hawkish interventionist sacked last week. Bolton was a proponent of military intervention in Iran, Venezuela, Syria, and North Korea, and Trump had reportedly complained that Bolton was actively trying to drag him into conflict. Announcing his dismissal, Trump said that he “strongly disagreed” with many of Bolton’s positions.
O’Brien is a lesser known name in foreign policy circles, and is currently serving as the special envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department. Though more used to overseeing the release of hostages from conflict zones, O’Brien was sent by Trump to Sweden in July, to try to secure the release of rapper A$AP Rocky, who was jailed for an alleged assault in Stockholm.
The negotiations failed, and Rocky was jailed before eventually being released pending a verdict.
O’Brien set forth his foreign policy beliefs in his 2016 book ‘While America Slept.’ In it, he called for a strengthening of America’s military alliances, the relevance of which Trump has questioned in the past, and an aggressive posture against China.
The diplomat also compared the Obama administration’s signing of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran to appeasing Nazi Germany. Given Trump’s promise on Wednesday to “substantially increase” sanctions on Tehran, O’Brien’s hiring likely signals no thaw in relations with the Islamic Republic.

Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has scrapped a tax on imports of open cell TV panels, used to make television displays, in a move likely to boost television manufacturing in the country and counter incentives offered by nations such as Vietnam. 
New Delhi had charged a 5% import tax on open cell TV panels, which was a factor in Samsung Electronics’ decision last year to shut its TV production unit in India and move production to Vietnam. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is keen to position India as an attractive electronics manufacturing destination at a time when growth in India has slowed sharply, and Washington and Beijing are engaged in a drawn out trade war. 
The dispute between the United States and China has led to higher tariffs on goods worth tens of billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, prompting companies to look at other countries to escape higher tariffs. 
Amid suggestions that India is late to capitalise on the trade war, ministries have been asked to submit policies and incentive structures to the country’s foreign investment promotion agency, Reuters has previously reported. Nine sectors including electronics, autos, pharmaceuticals and telecoms will be targeted. 
The move to scrap the tax on open cell panels is a step in the right direction, said Vikas Agarwal, the India head of OnePlus, a Chinese firm known for high-end Android smartphones. 
“TV is the next big focus for us. Any incentives or benefits are good for us,” said Agarwal, whose firm is seen making a foray into television sales in the country. 
The federal government’s decision would also provide respite to local TV manufacturers, which have been hit by cheap imports from Vietnam, said Manish Sharma, CEO of Panasonic India, the fourth biggest TV manufacturer in India. 
“The move will allow us to pass the (cost) benefits to the end-consumer, which would mean an about 3-4% reduction in price, thus providing the necessary thrust to the market,” he said.

The Financial Express
Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday stepped up her attack on Modi government over rising unemployment in the country. She said that the BJP government starts looking the other way when it comes to providing jobs to the youngsters.
She said that the potential and talent of youngsters can be used as an engine to drive the growth, but the government is in a regular habit of underestimating them. She said that when questions are asked, the government argues that north Indian youth don’t have merit.
“There are two lakh vacancies of teachers in Uttar Pradesh. The youth are finding new avenues for jobs. They are protesting under the sun and in the rains. But when it comes to providing jobs, people in the BJP government look the other way or say that youth of north India do not possess adequate merit,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.
Priyanka’s comments come in the backdrop of Union Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar’s Saturday statement that there was no dearth of employment opportunities in the country, but recruiters visiting north India complain of lack of ‘quality people’ to fill vacancies. The Bareilly MP, however, later clarified that he was only stressing on the lack of requisite skills among the youth and to address it, the Centre has set up the Skill Development Ministry.
Earlier on Monday, Priyanka had posted a video of Gangwar making the remarks at a press conference in Bareilly. Besides, she had also demanded from the minister to release the figures of how many jobs have been given to north Indians in the last five years.
Hitting out at the government over the state of the economy, she said that it can’t evade responsibility for the economic slowdown as people are watching. “One more company has suffered due to economic slowdown and people have lost their jobs,” Priyanka said as she referred to media reports claiming that automobile firm Mahindra will suspend production for 17 days.
Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in a Muzaffarpur court against Gangwar for allegedly ‘insulting’ the people of north India. The petition was filed by social activist Tamanna Hashmi on Monday. Hashmi said that he has filed the petition under sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot), 195 (fabricating false evidence), 295 (insult the religion of any class) and 405 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code. The matter is likely to come up before the court for hearing on September 25.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Monsoon rains in India in the week through to Wednesday were above average for a third straight week, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, with floods hitting many districts in the central parts of the country and damaging crops such as soybean and pulses. 
Monsoon rains are crucial to farm output and economic growth because the agricultural sector accounts for about 15% of India’s $2.5 trillion economy. 
India received 38% more rainfall than the 50-year average in the week to Sept. 18, data from IMD showed, with central India receiving 63% more rain. 
Overall, India has received 5% more rain than average since the start of the monsoon season on June 1.

New Delhi: Two men demanding grants for Divyang schools attempted suicide on Wednesday by jumping off from the second floor of the Mantralaya building onto the safety net in Mumbai.
As per reports, the two, identified as Hemant Patil and Arun Netore, jumped off from Mantralaya, the state secretariat building in south Mumbai seeking funds for ‘Divyang’ schools for the physically disabled. They were saved from injury as they fell into the safety net of the building.

Patil and Netore belong to the delegation of teachers who have been protesting for grants for schools. They have been detained by the Mumbai police and are currently under interrogation.
Further details are awaited.

MONROVIA (Reuters) - A fire at an Islamic school in Liberia has killed at least 27 children, police said on Wednesday. 
“The kids were learning the Koran when the fire broke out,” police spokesman Moses Carter said. He added the blaze was caused by an electrical issue and that further investigations were ongoing.  
Carter had originally said 30 children were killed before revising the death toll down to 27. Two survivors were taken to the hospital, he said. 
The fire started late on Tuesday in the suburbs of the capital Monrovia, President George Weah said in a tweet. 
“My prayers go out to the families of the children that died last night in Paynesville City,” Weah said. “This is a tough time for the families of the victims and all of Liberia.” 
It is common for buildings to collapse in blazes linked to faulty electrics in Liberia’s big cities, however these are rarely deadly.

Reuters
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s goods and services tax (GST) panel is unlikely to approve lowering the tax for the auto and allied components sector this week, as a study has warned of major revenue losses, two government officials said. 
A government study, attached to the agenda of a Sept. 20 GST panel meeting, has said the total annual revenue loss could be as much as 500 billion rupees ($6.95 billion), if the panel decided to lower tax rates for the auto sector to 18% from 28%. 
Meanwhile, state officials in Kerala, Punjab and West Bengal say they are also opposed to any cut in tax rates in the autos sector, or even consumer goods, because of lacklustre tax collections this fiscal year. 
In the April-July period, total tax revenues of 20 Indian states fell 7% to 4.9 trillion rupees compared with the same period last year.  
Some states were particularly hard hit, with data showing Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab tax collections plunged 59%, 35.5% and 12.5%, respectively.  
“I will oppose any reduction for the simple reason that it won’t be revenue neutral,” said Thomas Isaac, finance minister of the southern state of Kerala.

Mumbai: Care Ratings has downgraded ratings of Morgan Credit Pvt Ltd (MCPL) to BBB minus from A minus on account of the fall in stock price of the underlying shares of YES Bank Ltd which are held by the company.
YES Bank co-promoters Rana Kapoor and his family-owned firm MCPL is one of the promoters of the bank, holding 3.03% stake as on March 31, 2019. Along with its entities, the company held 10.62% stake in the private sector bank.
"The rating is based on internal credit enhancement of loan backed by pledge of shares. The rated NCD is backed by the unencumbered listed shares of Yes Bank Limited (YBL) held by Morgan Credit Private Limited (MCPL) or MCPL’s promoters and/ or their relatives," said the agency.
On 24 July, Mint had reported that MCPL had been forced to pledge its entire 7.34% stake with Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd (RNAM), asset manager of Reliance Mutual Fund (MF). The move follows the mutual fund converting a previously unsecured loan into a secured loan.
As the bank’s stock has lost 80% over the past year, an unsecured loan availed by MCPL from RNAM through issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) has been converted into a secured loan by creating a pledge on the entire 170.25 million shares held by Kapoor and MCPL.

Islamabad [Pakistan], Sept 18 (ANI): Pakistan's sham crackdown on terrorism was exposed yet again after a photo surfaced on social media showing ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) top political leaders sharing a stage with US-designated terrorist Maulana Fazlur Rehman Khalil.The photo, which was shared by, journalist Asif Shahzad, is from All Parties Kashmir Solidarity Conference which was held in Islamabad on September 16.The conference was attended by President of Pakistan occupied Kashmir Masood Khan and Prime Minister's Special Assistant on Information and Broadcasting Firdous Ashiq Awan among other prominent leaders. However, the presence of Khalil, a PTI leader and founder of the terrorist organisation Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), in the event meant to garner support for Kashmir was questionable.India has long blamed Pakistan for fuelling terror and supporting terrorist groups in Jammu and Kashmir to create unrest in the region. Imran Khan's party, which rose to power with a promise to not provide safe haven to terrorists, has been often blamed for supporting terrorist groups. Khan has been infamous as Taliban Khan for his staunch support to the terrorist group. Khalil's organization HuM, is said to have been in direct contact with Osama Bin Laden and his family when he was in Abbottabad and has been on the US State department's foreign terrorist organization list since 1997. Khalil has been a strong supporter of Imran Khan and advocated for the latter's candidature as the Prime Minister of the country last year. In March, Khan government received a lot of backlash for including of Khahil into the party. The photo has emerged weeks before the crucial Financial Action Task Force (FATF) meeting where Pakistan's compliance with the action plan will be assessed and it fears blacklisting. Pakistan has been under the FATF radar for its complicity towards terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) among others. In addition, terrorists like Hafiz Saeed are regularly seen ranting anti-India rhetoric and collecting so-called donations.The FATF recently gave a stern message to Pakistan to expedite its action plan for curbing terror financing by October or face the prospect of getting blacklisted, which could aggravate problems for its stagnant economy.

The New Indian Express
WASHINGTON: A 29-year-old man in the US has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for vandalising a Sikh temple in 2017, according to a media report.
Artyom Manukyan's sentence is concurrent with a penalty he faces under a prior arson case, Los Angeles Times reported.
He scrawled two hateful screeds outside the Hollywood Sikh Temple on Vermont Avenue in Los Feliz in August 2107, the Los Angeles Police Department said.
Police were earlier considering hate crime charges against Manukyan, saying the messages were designed as a threat to the Sikh community.
He pleaded no contest to felony vandalism of religious property in August 2018.
He was sentenced on Monday.
Before the 2017 incident, Manukyan was previously arrested on suspicion of burglary, grand theft auto and making criminal threats, the report said.
At the time of the vandalism, there had been an 11.5 per cent increase in hate crimes across California in the previous year, according to the California Department of Justice.

Daily Mail
A judge in Bermuda has been criticised by the British Court of Appeals for telling a murder trial he was getting 'horny' because of the amount of sex mentioned in the case.
Carlisle Greaves, who served until last month as a junior judge in the British overseas territory, made the outrageous remark while a witness gave crucial evidence during the trial.
The murder trial, which saw Khyri Smith-Williams convicted of slaying Colford Ferguson, was taken to the Court of Appeal when defense attorney Jerome Lynch demanded a retrial, claiming the judge had behaved inappropriately.
Calisle Greaves, who served until last month as a junior judge in the British overseas territory, made the outrageous remark while a witness gave crucial evidence during the hearing
The Court of Appeal ultimately rejected the calls but Appeal judge Sir Maurice Kay said the court could not condone the lewd comments. 
Mr Justice Kay said: 'In particular, his comment "all this sex is beginning to get me horny" was inappropriate and inimical to the dignity of court proceedings. 
'Mr Lynch was justified in criticising it. However, I do not believe that it damaged the defence or had the potential to undermine the safety of the conviction.'   
Smith-Williams was sentenced to serve at least 35 years in prison last October, after he was found guilty of the murder by a majority verdict. 
Mr Ferguson, a 29-year-old father of one, was shot dead in February 2011, as he worked on a house in Somerset, Bermuda - which is a cluster of 181 islands in the North Atlantic usually referred to in the collective.
Troy Harris, a witness for the Crown, told the court that Smith-Williams confessed his involvement in the killing to him and admitted that he had driven the getaway motorbike.
He said Smith-Williams also told him that Rasheed Muhammad had pulled the trigger and that Mr. Ferguson was not the intended target.
Smith-Williams launched an appeal against his conviction, which was heard in June.
In the hearing, Mr Lynch criticised Mr Justice Greaves's handling of the case, particularly his behaviour during Mr Harris's evidence.
He argued that the judge had done little to rein in the witness's use of vulgar language and that the 'tacit approval' of the behaviour had lent it credibility.
In transcripts presented to the Court of Appeal, Mr Harris cursed repeatedly, called Mr Muhammad a f****t and made repeated references to 'f***ing p***y'.
But the higher court found Mr Justice Greaves's response to the unsavoury language was not prejudicial.
Mr Justice Kay wrote: 'Anybody familiar with serious criminal trials, in this jurisdiction in recent years, knows the judge has a very personal style, whereby he engages with witnesses, defendants, juries and advocates in an informal way, often using casual language and rich metaphors.
'In relation to Harris, it was important that the judge should facilitate his evidence, whatever it turned out to be.
'If he took the view, and I suspect he did, that the best course was to let the witness have his say, subject to the rules of evidence, rather than seek to inhibit him, it seems to me that that was an exercise of judgment which was open to him.'

Facebook will use footage from police body cameras to train its automatic detection systems to spot and remove footage of mass shootings. The company announced Tuesday that it will partner with law enforcement in the US and UK to obtain footage from their firearms training programs. Data from those videos should help Facebook's systems detect real-world, first-person footage of violent events.
According to Financial Times, Facebook will provide the UK's Metropolitan Police with body cameras at no cost. In exchange, Facebook will have access to that data, which it will also share with the UK Home Office. The company is reportedly in talks with US law enforcement about a similar partnership.
Facebook was criticized this spring when, after the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, footage from the attack was available on Facebook for weeks following the event. Part of the problem, Facebook said, is that it did not have enough content depicting first-person footage of violent events to train its machine learning technology. Facebook hopes footage from the police training programs will allow it to improve its automatic detection systems. By making those systems more accurate, Facebook may also reduce the likelihood that it will mistakenly remove violent scenes from fictional content, like movies or video games.
Facebook says some of the changes it has made to combat hate and terrorism predate the Chirstchurch shooting. "But that attack, and the global response to it in the form of the Christchurch Call to Action, has strongly influenced the recent updates to our policies and their enforcement," Facebook wrote in a press release. Tomorrow, the company is expected to testify alongside Google and Twitter before a US Senate committee on how it's tackling violent and extremist content online.

New Delhi (India), Sept 18 (ANI): Slamming Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for her tweet in which she allegedly undermined the importance of international events for bringing in investments, Baijayant Panda, BJP said that Congress leader should not criticize the work done in the national interest for the sake of her politics."Her statement is unfortunate. This is also a way to bring investments. Modi Ji has done such big programmes in foreign countries due to which last year Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of worth Rs 64 billion dollar came. It was an increase over to that of its previous year while FDI in rest of the world witnessed a downward trend," said Panda."In the first quarter this year, FDI has increased by 28 per cent. Such events promote India in the world due to which investments come. For doing politics it is fair to say something against political parties or their leaders but she should not criticize the work done in the national interest for the sake of politics," he said. He said that such events not only help in bringing FDI but also helped in fetching support for Jammu and Kashmir."Over Jammu and Kashmir, many countries have supported India. At UNSC, majority of the countries have supported India's stance. Even the middle-east countries who have traditionally not supported India on Kashmir have supported us. Such events reap benefits," he said."Just display of pomp and show, reiterating 5-trillion, managing media headlines doesn't lead to economic improvement. Investors don't come by doing planned events abroad. The trust of investors is shaken. The land for economic investment has been ripped," tweeted Priyanka Gandhi.The event titled 'Howdy, Modi!' is being hosted by the Texas India Forum at Houston on September 22. The summit, with the theme of "Shared Dreams, Bright Futures" will highlight the contributions of Indian-Americans in enriching the American life for the last seven decades as well as the key role they have played in strengthening relations between the two nations.Over 50,000 people have already been registered for the event, which will be hosted by the Texas India Forum.

Times Now
Chennai: The debate over making Hindi a national language has taken a rather violent turn after several youth workers of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam defaced the name of a railway station that was written in Hindi in Tamil Nadu’s Gudiyattam area on Wednesday.
DMK cadres were detained for blackening the Hindi text on the Gudiyattam railway station signage in Vellore district. The incident comes at a time when the DMK has announced a state-wide protest against Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s remarks about Hindi being a unifying language.
In a video accessed by Times Now, several youths allegedly from the DMK can be seen holding ‘Get Out Hindhi’ placards and smearing the Hinti text of the signboard on the platform in black ink.
Last Saturday, Amit Shah had said on the occasion of Hindi Diwas that a common language would be “the mark of India’s global identity” and expressed intention to make Hindi the national language. However, the Centre faced a lot of backlash from opposition parties and people from the southern part of India where Hindi is not a widely-spoken language.
This drew the ire of the DMK-ruled Tamil Nadu government that announced state-wide protests on September 20 condemning the ‘Hindi imposition’. “This meet urges the Centre to give up the imposition of Hindi language immediately and engage itself in useful activities that will develop the nation,” the DMK said in a statement, according to news agency PTI.
Former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, who is currently under trial and is lodged in the Tihar jail in the INX Media money laundering case, also voiced his displeasure with it and urged the people of Tamil Nadu to join the DMK in its protest.
“A dangerous idea that Hindi alone can unite the people of this country has been floated. The Tamil people, as well as all others who speak other languages, will never allow the imposition of Hindi. We support the development of all languages, but we will never accept the idea that Hindi alone will unite the people of this country. I urge the TNCC president KS Alagiri to ask all Congress workers to join the state-wide protest announced by the DMK on 20.09.2019 to oppose the imposition of Hindi,” Chidambaram said in a tweet posted by his family from his official Twitter account.






Earlier in the day, actor-turned-politician Rajinikanth, after Kamal Haasan, expressed their displeasure with the Home Minister’s remark to make Hindi a national language, with Rajinikanth saying that “no one will accept the imposition of Hindi, especially in Tamil Nadu and southern India”. “No Shah, Sultan or Samrat should renege on that promise. We respect all languages but our mother language will always be Tamil,” Kamal Haasan had said on Monday.
“India is a country of different languages and every language has its own significance. But it is important to have a language for the whole country, which should become the identity of India in the world. Today, if one language can do the work of unifying the country, then it's Hindi, the most spoken language,” Shah had said in a series of tweets.

Arun, one of the organisers of the protests in Bengaluru's Electronic City zone said, "I do not have access to the app now. Don't know when I have been debarred. I am not sure when exactly this happened since I last logged in on Friday. Now other than screenshots, I have very little proof of the kind of work I have done as they are not letting me log into the app."
Arun further complained, "We are not called employees and do not enjoy any such benefits. We are called partners, but then why does the company change the rates without consulting us?"
When contacted, a Zomato spokesperson confirmed to TNM that some accounts were suspended.
"Certain delivery partners (0.1% of the Bangalore fleet), who were found instigating and hindering services for other partners pursuing their deliveries, have been momentarily suspended. We are in discussion with all our delivery partners in the city and regret the inconvenience caused to our users,” the spokesperson said.
At least 6,000 delivery executives across Bengaluru and Mumbai— two of the major food delivery markets have partially or fully logged out of the app protesting the recent unilateral move by the company. They say that the new fares will significantly affect their quality of life.
However, no delivery executives from Mumbai have reported suspension of accounts yet.
In Bengaluru, Arun is not alone. Those leading protests in the 20 odd localities in Bengaluru have also faced the same fate.
Sunil Suresh, another such delivery executive from Sahakarnagar in Bengaluru has also lost access to the app. "The company has blocked around 10 such executives from every locality,” he claims.
The executives say that they do not know who their team leader or the manager is. They also do not have any explanation from the company on why they no longer have access to the company.
Other than being debarred from the app, delivery executives allege their payments which are made on a weekly basis has been withheld.
Not the first case
Kaveri Medappa, a research scholar based in Bengaluru studying the working conditions of these app-based workers says that experiences are largely similar amongst platform-dependent on-demand workers. These companies start eating into workers' incomes to increase revenue once they have consolidated their market shares to some extent.
“There have been many accounts from workers who have felt targeted by these platforms for having raised questions with them. Their IDs are suddenly blocked for no reason and they have to spend hours and sometimes days to have it sorted; some have witnessed a drastic reduction in the number of deliveries allotted to them soon after they raise a complaint or express disagreements over pay or orders. So, you see that algorithms are used to control, monitor and discipline workers,” she says.
She added, “Workers often express feeling cheated regarding work conditions, which have an adverse effect on earnings.  In countries like Spain and UK, food delivery workers are fighting legal battles to have platforms recognise them as employees and are rejecting the label of "partners". In Spain, the workers have won the case for now.”
Need for collectivisation
Pointing at the recent legislation passed by the US state of California, which makes it difficult to classify workers as "independent contractors", the All India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) has called for these workers to unionise.
“These delivery partners are assumed to be ‘freelancers’. But they are not independent at all. Companies dodge themselves from providing minimum facilities that any employee can possess. They are pushed to long working hours and gruelling work conditions. There are strict control and supervision over the hours and location of their work and there is no job security. Along with that, there are regular variations in pay-out, delivery charges and incentives. AIDYO wishes to organize these delivery agents to fight for their rights,” Vinay Sarathy,  vice-president, AIDYO, Bangalore Chapter, said.

A 20-year-old man, identified as Kishan Debnath, was lynched by a mob in the Kumarghat village in North Tripura on Tuesday, 17 Septemer. He was attacked for allegedly stealing.
Debnath was found in possession of a mobile phone, a headphone and bicycle, allegedly stolen the previous day from the houses owned by Dilip Das (50) and Sukesh Das (55).
“The villagers brought Debnath to Sukantapalli and started beating him. On getting information, we rescued Debnath and admitted him to a local hospital, where he died,” said officer-in-charge told Hindustan Times.

Both Dilip and Sukesh, prime suspects in the lynching case, have been arrested by the Tripura police, the newspaper report said.
Three states – Rajasthan, Manipur and West Bengal have framed anti-lynching laws to provide for stricter punishment to culprits. The Supreme Court had earlier this year asked the Centre to pass a separate law on lynching.

Mumbai: The markets regulator on Tuesday barred Gautam Thapar, former chairman of CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, and three former officials of the company from the securities market, after a preliminary probe found them guilty of various irregularities.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) also asked BSE to appoint an independent auditor to conduct a forensic audit of the books of CG Power beginning 2015-16 and report in six months.
In its late evening order, Sebi said Thapar, former chief financial officer V.R. Venkatesh, former director of finance Madhav Acharya and former director B. Hariharan were found to be prima facie guilty of misusing the company’s assets to facilitate loans for certain third parties; round-tripping of funds; concealing payment details; and unfairly extending interest-free loans to promoter group entities.
These actions were designed to siphon off the company’s money and led to losses for its shareholders, amounting to a fraud on public investors, Sebi said.
The preliminary probe indicated a “serious misstatement of accounts and diversion of funds" from CG Power and its subsidiaries, the 32-page order by Sebi whole-time member G. Mahalingam said.
The four individuals used CG Power’s assets as collateral to help third parties obtain loans without authorization from the board, the order said. It said these individuals used different accounting heads to conceal payments made by CG Power, and entered into dubious transactions for reducing the liability of the promoter-affiliated companies towards CG Power.

RT
Three widely-circulated clips depicting military aircraft interacting with UFOs – mysterious objects performing maneuvers not possible using existing aviation technology – were never supposed to be released to the public, the Navy’s Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare spokesman Joseph Gradisher told the Black Vault earlier this month, but the videos are genuine – and their contents can’t be explained.
“The Navy designates the objects contained in these videos as unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAP), Gradisher said, explaining that UAP is used instead of UFO as the “basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges.”
Translated into English: we don’t know what they are, but there’s no evidence they’re alien in origin.
One clip (“FLIR1”) shows a dark, pill-shaped object hovering for several seconds before scooting sideways extremely fast. Another (“GoFast”) shows the observing aircraft’s sensor lock onto a fast-moving target as the pilots are heard in the background excitedly wondering what exactly they’ve stumbled across. The third (“Gimbal”) shows an oblong object moving steadily before stopping and rotating as the pilots observing it exclaim in surprise.
The videos were released to Luis Elizondo – a former military intelligence officer who claims to have directed the Pentagon’s UFO research arm, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program – in 2017, for use in a database about aerial threats. While declassified, they were not cleared for general public use.
Since then, the videos have made their way to the New York Times and To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, a consortium of former intelligence officers, scientists, and celebrities promoting the investigation of UFOs and other “scientific mysteries.” The Pentagon complained, stating earlier this year that the videos “should still be withheld” as they were “never officially released to the general public,” but it’s a bit too late to put the unidentified flying cat back in the bag.
The Navy set up guidelines earlier this year for reporting “unidentified aircraft” entering US airspace, ensuring no encounter would go undocumented in response to a plethora of reports, and lawmakers have reportedly requested briefings on the issue as the Pentagon’s history of chasing UFOs under secretive programs like AATIP has become public knowledge.

Times Now
Members of a family from Madhya Pradesh have a genetic anomaly that has made it difficult for them to find jobs and complete their education.
The 25-member family lives in Betul's Aathner tehsil. All of them have polydactyly, a congenital condition of supernumerary fingers. Polydactyly can occur by itself, or more commonly, as one feature of a syndrome of congenital anomalies
Baldev Yawale said there are some family members with more than 10 fingers in their hands and toes. "My children went to school but they did not get to complete their education. School students used to tease my children. I seek help from the government. I have no land. We are very poor," Yawale told ANI.
Santosh, who has 12 fingers in hand and 14 in feet, says he was unable to complete his education and find a job due to the genetic anomaly. He added that even regular chores become quite a task as normal slippers do not fit his feet.
"Normal slippers and shoes do not fit into my feet. I have studied till Class 10. Once, I went for Army examination but I failed in physical examination. I want that the government should help us,” said Santosh.
“I have a total of 12 fingers in hand and 14 on my feet. I did not get a job because of this. I am not getting any help from the village panchayat," he added.
The extra fingers may be the reason for grief and distress for the Yawales, but the anomaly has certainly made them and their village famous.  Now, people from adjoining villages and far off districts come to Athner to see the Yawales.
But not everyone had trouble with the condition of polydactyly. Sir Garfield Sobers, the famous West Indies cricketer is said to have had an extra digit on both his hands but had them surgically removed. Hollywood actor Halle Berry has an extra toe on her left foot and Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan has an extra and fused thumb on his right hand.
Hrithik has even been voted the sexiest man in Asia by US weekly. The actor has time and again expressed that he feels 'lucky' because he has a 'piece of ugly.'
He had even written on his official Facebook page: "I am lucky. Not cause I got voted sexiest. Cause I just noticed God gave me a piece of ugly to carry with me to remind myself n others of how beautiful our imperfections make us. My thumb used to repel people in school. Today I am posting it to millions like you who I know are just like me. Beautifully imperfect. Thank you, God for this wonderful life. Make your weaknesses your strength. Be proud. U are beautiful. Trust me."

Times Now
Mumbai: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Akhil Chitre on Wednesday slammed megastar Amitabh Bachchan for joining the chorus of voices lobbying for the construction of the metro in Mumbai by cutting trees.
Speaking to ANI, Chitre said, "In 2010, Amitabh Bachchan was opposing the metro just because his privacy was getting hampered. But, within a few years, after the change of the government, his views changed. I do not know what deal he has done with the current government. His views may also have changed because of the change of route of the metro. It is very sad when people across Mumbai are protesting against the cutting of trees in Aarey forest, he is tweeting in favour of metro construction there."
On Tuesday, Bachchan took to Twitter and called metro as a faster, convenient and efficient mode of transport and suggested that metro is the solution to combat the menace of air pollution.
"Friend of mine had a medical emergency, decided to take METRO instead of his car .. came back very impressed .. said was faster, convenient and most efficient .. Solution for Pollution ...Grow more trees .. I did in my garden .. have you," the Bollywood actor tweeted.\
However, there are some Bollywood actors who are against the cutting of trees in Aarey forest and have also protested against the construction of the metro.
On September 11, actor Shraddha Kapoor joined protesters opposing the decision of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's tree Authority to slash 27,000 trees in the Aarey forest, to make car shed for the metro.
The Saaho actor also posted a picture on Instagram of herself holding a placard from the protest and wrote, "It is shocking, unacceptable and has to stop."

Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said all electronics companies are bullish on the Indian market and iPhone maker Apple is going to come in the country with big business plans.
Prasad said that during his regime, mobile factories in India has increased from 2 to 268, including component makers for the handsets. The minister said he had whole day meeting with global and Indian chief executive officers of the electronics industry on Monday.
"All are gung-ho about India. Even Apple is going to come to India in a big way. Samsung has come. My focus area now is strategic electronics, defence electronics and medical electronics. I would urge leading lights of the industry that this is a promising area of growth," Prasad said while speaking at an AIMA event.
The government on Monday exhorted Apple to expand manufacturing base in India and use the country as an export hub, as it promised to line up fresh incentives and sops to galvanise electronics as well as the phone industry in the coming 2-3 months.
Apple, which works with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron in India, currently makes iPhone 6S and 7 here.
The minister urged the industry leaders present at the AIMA event to get engage in the medical electronics business.
"Medical electronics from MRI machines to pathology machines, X-Ray machines, and testing machines -- all have a big future. It is a huge market available. India is a huge market waiting to be tapped. Please join them," Prasad said.

It appears Juul's fortunes are about to get even worse. Bloomberg reports retailers in China have pulled the company's products just one week after they became available within the country. Citing a "person familiar with the matter," the publication says Juul wasn't told why its e-cigarettes and nicotine pods were removed from both physical and online stores, making it unclear whether the ongoing trade war between the US and China was a factor.
It's safe to say, however, the setback comes at a time when Juul faces uncertain prospects in the US. Last week, the Trump administration announced it may ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes. Two states, New York and Michigan, have already enacted their own bans. At the same time, the company is the target of separate investigations by the House, Senate and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Without access to the Chinese market, the company is likely to have a more difficult time weathering new restrictions in its home country.

Times Now
New Delhi: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday (September 18) okayed payment of productivity linked bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78 days wages to eligible 11 lakh non-gazetted railway employees. Addressing the press after the meeting, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union minister Prakash Javadekar informed that railway employees are to receive 78 days of bonus.
Javadekar announced that Rs 2,024 crore will be spent on this exercise, and 11 lakh employees will benefit from this move. This is for the sixth consecutive year that productivity-linked bonus is being given to railway employees by the government.
"For 11 lakh railway employees, this govt has consistently for last 6 years, being giving record bonus, equivalent to the wage of 78 days. This year also, 11,52,000 employees will get 78 days wage as bonus. This is the reward for productivity", said the Union minister
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed that the Union Cabinet has given its approval to ban e-cigarettes. It means the production, manufacturing, import/export, transport, sale, distribution, storage and advertising related to e-cigarettes are banned. "The Cabinet has suggested passing an ordinance to address this issue, and we hope to take this up in the next Parliament meeting, " said Sitharaman.
Javadekar added, "We are trying to curb a problem before it becomes rampant. Current measures on regular cigarette use are slowly taking effect, like smoking in public places is slowly being reduced."
It was expected that FM Sitharaman would announce all the Cabinet approvals on the announcements made so far which included a mega bank consolidation drive, a special fund for real estate, export incentives, and sops for the ailing automobile and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sectors.
However, the press conference was brief and the ministers just announced railway employees' bonus and e-cigarette ban approval.
It is worth mentioning that FM Sitharaman will chair the 37th meeting of the GST Council, which is expected to take place on September 20. The Council will discuss rate revisions for various sectors, such as automobiles, fast-moving consumer goods, and hotels. Besides, she will also meet heads of the PSBs to discuss issues, including following up on transmission of monetary policy rates.

New Delhi: In a breach of national security, a hard disk and a multi function control (MFC) processor were stolen and damaged inside Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC)-Vikrant docked at the Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL).

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which was manning the dock for any suspicious movement or possible terror activity, said that while private security had been manning the construction area of the dock, the probe had been handed over to the state police.
“The disk contains sensitive information crucial for national security and a probe is underway to check if it was an insider job or not," said a person familiar with the development.

Times Now
New Delhi: India on Wednesday made a formal request to Pakistan to allow the use of its airspace for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flight to the United States later this week. PM Modi is due to depart for New York this weekend to attend the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
News agency ANI reported quoting the Pakistani media that India has made a formal request to Pakistan “to allow the use of its airspace for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flight to New York, US.”
The report said Pakistan will hold consultations before announcing its decision on the request.
The development comes amidst heightened tensions between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. Earlier this month, Pakistan had refused to allow the use of its airspace for President Ram Nath Kovind’s flight. The President was due to travel to Europe for a three-nation tour.



While rejecting India's request for allowing the use of its airspace for the India President, Pakistan's Federal Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan had said that enough is enough.
Khan had said that Pakistan had earlier allowed the use of its airspace for PM Modi's flight to France last month as a goodwill gesture.
While reacting to the denial of use of airspace for the President's flight, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said: “We regret the decision of the Pakistan government to deny overflight clearance for a VVIP special flight, which is otherwise granted routinely by any normal country. We call on Pakistan to recognise the futility of such unilateral actions.”
It may be noted that Pakistan had shut its airspace following the Balakot airstrikes in February, post the Pulwama terror attack. Indian Air Force planes had on February 26 struck at a terror facility in Pakistan’s Balakot to target the Jaish-e-Mohammed group, which had carried out the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which over 40 CRPF personnel were killed.

Times Now
Srinagar: A month after Pakistan’s Border Action Team was eliminated during an infiltration bid in Kashmir’s Keran sector, Indian Army sources on Wednesday released a video showing the BAT team trying to infiltrate into Indian territory on the intervening night of September 12-13 in Haji Pir sector of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).
The suspicious activity by the Pakistani BAT team was timely spotted and foiled by the Indian Army with the help of Under Barrel Grenade Launchers. Commandos or terrorists belonging to Pakistan’s Special Service Group (SSG), which forms the core of the BAT, was believed to be behind the infiltration bid.
Despite repeated denials, Pakistan has been trying to push terrorists into Indian territory, with the Indian Army managing to foil over 15 infiltration attempts by Pakistan along the Line of Control.
The development comes in the wake of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s statement on Tuesday when he said that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is a part of India and India one day expects to control the jurisdiction over the region, adding that India’s stand on PoK has been consistent.
“Our position on PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) has always been and will always be very clear. PoK is a part of India and we expect one day that we will have the physical jurisdiction over it,” EAM Jaishankar said on Tuesday.
Last month, the Northern Command of the Army said in a statement on August 3 said that security forces had foiled an infiltration bid by a BAT squad in the Keran sector where around 5-7 Pakistani army soldier or terrorists were eliminated and their bodies were seen lying along the Line of Control.

Google Assistant users outside the US haven't had much choice when it comes to voice options -- until now, as Google launches a second voice for Assistant in French, German, Dutch, Japanese, Norwegian, Korean, Italian and English for India and the UK.
The new voices have been built with DeepMind's WaveNet technology to help them sound natural, and will be displayed in settings as a color, rather than as a gender. Users selecting a voice in one of these languages will be able to choose from "orange" or "red," and when you set up Google Assistant for the first time you'll be randomly assigned one of them. According to Google, "We've learned that people enjoy choosing between voices to find one that sounds right to them, and we think it's important to present these voices without any labels." The new voice options launch today.

New Delhi (India), Sept 18 (ANI): BJP's national vice president, Baijayant Panda slammed Congress leader Digvijaya Singh for his controversial remark that people wearing saffron clothes commit rapes.He said that Digvijaya is trying to foment phobia against the Hindu community."Digvijaya Singh is known for making very controversial statements and almost all of his statements go in a particular direction which tries to foment phobia against one community," said Panda talking to ANI here on Tuesday."People have answered such allegations in election after election. For a person who addresses terrorist and killers with respect what else can you expect from him?" he asked.  "It is not right to say this, there are people from various religions who commit atrocities and action should be taken against them all," he added."If you look at statics, it is quite obvious, people from the Hindu community are not particularly more involved in crime whether they wear saffron or not wear it. Statics shows that it is probably less than many other communities," said Panda."Attacking one community is his speciality and it doesn't garner much support," he added.  Congress leader Digvijaya Singh stoked a controversy on Tuesday by saying that  "people are wearing saffron clothes and committing crimes like rape.""Today, people are wearing saffron clothes and raping girls. Rapes are are taking place inside temples, is this our religion? Those who have defamed our 'Sanatan Dharma', not even God will forgive them," Singh said at an event in Bhopal.Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath was also present at the event.Attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Kamal Nath said, "Some people are understandably unhappy at my participation here as they think they have bagged a contract on religious matters."

Chennai (Tamil Nadu) [India], Sept 18 (ANI): Amid controversy over Union Home Minister Amit Shah's call to culturally unify India with Hindi as its national language, Veteran actor and politician Rajnikanth on Wednesday said that none of the southern states will accept imposition of Hindi and asserted that no language should be imposed."Hindi shouldn't be imposed. Not just Tamil Nadu but none of the southern states will accept the imposition of Hindi. Not only Hindi, but no language should be imposed," he told reporters here.However, Rajnikanth advocated the idea of having a common language across the country and said it is good for the country's unity and progress."If there is a common language it is good for country's unity and progress but forcing a language is not acceptable," he said.  Earlier, Shah's comment on making Hindi as its national language triggered a row when some opposition leaders trained guns on him demanding to reconsider his appeal as it "poses a danger to the national unity".Shah, in his address on Hindi Diwas, appealed to people to accept Hindi as the national language to get connected.

OnePlus on Tuesday posted the first official renders of its upcoming OnePlus 7T smartphone on its official forum. The smartphone seems to be a more 'rounded off' variant of the OnePlus 7 launched earlier this year.
The smartphone will have an even smaller display notch at the top, that was reduced to a dewdrop notch starting from OnePlus 6T. Also new would be the rear camera setup, that has now been placed in a circular dial centrally. The smartphone is now officially confirmed to sport three cameras.
OnePlus also teased the 90Hz, Fluid AMOLED display that will be fitted on the OnePlus 7T. The display made its debut on the OnePlus 7 Pro and was praised by critics for delivering great performance and perceived speed.
Just like in the past, when OnePlus brought forward special finishes for its 'T' badged smartphones, this year too will see a special colour.
Pete Lau on OnePlus forums said: While we were extremely happy with our matte-frosted glass, we didn't stop there. We kept exploring, improving, and trying new things. The result? A new smooth matte surface with a brilliant metallic radiance, and we're excited to be introducing this new finish on our upcoming flagship.
The smartphone will be unveiled on 26 September, the company has confirmed. We can also expect the launch of the much anticipated OnePlus TV on the same day.

Cricket Country
The BCCI‘s Anti-Corruption Unit chief Ajit Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday suggested a match-fixing law, besides legalisation of betting, to tackle corruption in Indian cricket.

Shekhawat, who was the Director General of Police in Rajasthan before taking charge of BCCI’s Anti-corruption Unit in April 2018, gave his suggestions in an interview to PTI. This was after 12 cricketers, including national and international, reported corrupt approaches in the last one year, the Tamil Nadu Premier League came under scanner for suspect activity and a woman cricketer reported an approach from a bookie.

In the light of cases emerging from the leagues of Mumbai, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu this year, has match-fixing or spot fixing become unstoppable in the country?
“It is not unstoppable. We probably require a law against it, a match-fixing law. If there is a clear law against it, police will also have a clear cut role,” Shekhawat said.

Last year, the Law Commission of India had expressed the need to make match-fixing a criminal offence, like it is in England and Australia. Legalised betting is another way to deal with corruption in the game, explained Shekhawat.
“May be there could be a thinking about legalising gambling so that all this illegal business which goes on can be controlled. Legal betting will be done under some parameters and it can be controlled,” he said. “It will also bring a huge amount of revenue for the government, close to what the excise department generates. The amount of money which is bet on sports is mindboggling.”
He said a move like this would also help keep a tab on the people involved as well as the money.
“Revenue is not the only consideration, there could be other issues which the government has in mind. I am not saying categorically that it should be legalised but it should be considered. It could be regulated when it is legalised, right now it is totally illegal.
“Once it is legalised you will also get the data on who is betting and how much is he betting. And while doing that, make illegal betting tougher. Right now you can get away with a fine of few hundreds or a few thousands,” he said.
Men’s cricket has been prone to corruption for long but now even the women’s game is not immune to the menace. In February, an India women’s cricketer reported a corrupt approach to the BCCI, prompting the ICC to conduct an inquiry. On Monday, an FIR was lodged against two individuals in the matter.
“Anything which is given wide publicity, which is telecast live, it lends itself to betting and once something lends itself to betting then it could be anything. If they find out that it is getting tough to make headway in men’s cricket, they may try to go to women’s cricket,” he pointed out.
“If that is also tough, they may try the state leagues and if that is also proving to be tough, they may they have their own league like it was in the case of Rajputana league.”
Since Shekhawat took charge, the BCCI ACU has witnessed some wholesale changes in its functioning. The department has more staff now, eight personnel to be precise, and it plans to recruit 5-6 more in the near future.
“This is the first time we have totally taken over the anti-corruption of the state run leagues. It is also the first time our officials are staying at the team hotels to keep a watch on the players.
“We also organise anti-corruption classes for the participants. We tell them what anti-corruption code is, what the penalties are and what are the responsibilities cast upon each of the participants,” he explained. “Like when an approach is made, it is incumbent upon the participant to report it. If he doesn’t report it, it is an offence and he could be penalised. Due to anti-corruption classes, the players have started reporting approaches.”

The Financial Express
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Tuesday took a dig at West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee who is slated to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi tomorrow. He claimed that the Trinamool Congress chief is meeting the PM in “a last-ditch effort” to save former Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar. The last time that both leaders had met was at a convocation ceremony at Shantiniketan’s Visva Bharati University on May 25 last year. During the general elections earlier this year, Banerjee had refused to meet Modi when the state was under cyclone threat saying she would meet the next PM after polls as elections were underway.
Vijayvargiya said that Banerjee knew well that Kumar’s arrest would lead half of her ministers behind bars in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam. The TMC in its response to Vijayavargiya termed his claims as baseless, saying that the CM was within her rights to meet the Prime Minister to discuss issues related to development of the state.
In recent times, a number of Trinamool leaders and former city top cop Rajeev Kumar have been under the scanner of the CBI in the Saradha scam. With Kumar still not ready to appear before the CBI, days after Calcutta High Court vacated its previous interim order that gave Kumar protection from arrest in the case, the CBI has moved a Basirhat court seeking a non-bailable warrant against him. Currently serving as West Bengal CID Additional Director General, Kumar was part of a Special Investigation Team that was formed by the state government to probe the scam, before the case was handed over to the CBI in 2014.
The Saradha group allegedly duped lakhs of people of close to Rs 2500 crore, promising a higher return on investing.

The CBI’s attempts to question Rajeev Kumar have previously resulted in a major political battle between the Centre and the TMC. Earlier this year when a CBI team landed at Kumar’s official residence to probe him in the case, the ex-top cop was not found. Some of the sleuths were taken into custody as they had allegedly come without proper documents. However, they were soon let off. What followed was political high drama as Mamata Banerjee came in support of Kumar and sat on a dharna alleging interference by the Centre in government institutions.

Bengaluru: Oyo Hotels and Homes, the operator of India’s largest network of hotels, is in talks with financial institutions to borrow $200 million to buy premium and luxury hotels in the US, two people familiar with the matter said.
The company, which bought Hooters Casino Hotel in Las Vegas last month, has identified the premium hotels segment as its area of focus outside India, the people said on condition of anonymity.
Oyo’s overseas push into the premium and luxury segment is a departure from its strategy in India, where 25-year-old founder Ritesh Agarwal has signed up thousands of small hotels onto his online platform and helped them upgrade and standardize their rooms to cater to budget travellers.
Agarwal is now spending a major part of his time in the US to expand Oyo’s presence in the world’s largest economy.
“Oyo is going to create a separate entity in the US to help it acquire and run four and five star hotel assets in America," said one of the two people. “It is in talks with several financial institutions to raise debt to fund these transactions."
Oyo is likely to own a minority stake in the US entity being created for owning the hotel assets, the person said.
Earlier this month, Oyo purchased a 64-suite building in Ahmedabad for an undisclosed amount. Oyo partnered Gurugram-based Mountania Developers for the transaction as well as to redesign the building into a premium four star hotel by the end of this year.
This marked Oyo’s debut into the business travellers’ segment in India.
In its first property purchase in the US, Oyo bought the Hooters hotel in August. In the transaction, Oyo and Highgate, a US real estate investment and hospitality management company, were said to have infused $135 million to develop the asset, a person aware of the development told Mint at that time.
“We are excited with our rapid growth and early success in the US, our newest home market, where our partnership with Highgate to open the doors to our first flagship hotel in Las Vegas, Oyo Hotels and Casino, has been a key milestone," said an Oyo spokesperson, without commenting on the debt raising process. “We have already hit the 100 hotels mark in a short span. We continue to explore ways to create value for our asset owners, while enabling all our guests to experience #LivingTheGoodLife at an Oyo near them."
Oyo’s strategy to raise debt to buy hotels is not unique to the US. It has followed a similar strategy in India and Europe. “They have raised a couple of property funds where SoftBank has put in money as well to buy hospitality and other assets here in India and other countries," said a person familiar with the firm’s strategy, requesting anonymity. “The idea is that they are going to be tenants of these properties, so they want to create real estate investment trust (REIT)-like returns via ownership."
Oyo has been on a buying spree in the hotels asset space. In May, it agreed to acquire Amsterdam-based @Leisure Group from Axel Springer, a media and technology firm, for an undisclosed amount. @Leisure is a vacation rental company based in Europe, which manages holiday homes and holiday parks, as well as holiday apartments.
Oyo has raised nearly $1.7 billion in funding over 12 rounds. In March, Mint reported that Oyo was tapping the venture debt route to buy properties in India to expand its Townhouse offerings.

Reuters
(Reuters Health) - Airborne carbon particles that can cause health problems in adults and children are getting into the placenta as it nourishes a developing fetus, a new study has found. 
Tissue samples from 5 pre-term and 23 full-term births found that the more airborne soot the mother was exposed to during pregnancy, the higher the number of so-called black carbon particles found in the placenta, researchers report in Nature Communications. 
In addition to transferring oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the fetus, the placenta is supposed to be a barrier — albeit not a perfect one — that protects the fetus from substances that might harm it. 
Dr. Frank Gilliland of the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, characterized the findings as “pretty remarkable.” 
“Our results demonstrate that the human placental barrier is not impenetrable for particles,” said the team, led by Tim Nawrot of Hasselt University in Belgium. 
Whether those particles, created by the combustion of fossil fuels, pose a direct risk to the fetus is an unresolved question. But the researchers speculate that the pollutants may play a role in the low birth weight or premature delivery more  often seen in babies whose mothers are exposed to higher levels of contaminated air. 
“This builds on a growing body of evidence that these particles are actually absorbed and distributed throughout the human body, said Dr. Gilliland, a professor of preventive medicine in Keck’s Division of Environmental Medicine.

Reuters
JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will restore its lost oil production by the end of September and has managed to recover supplies to customers to the levels they were at prior to weekend attacks on its facilities by drawing from its huge oil inventories.  
Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that average oil production in September and October would be 9.89 million barrels per day and that the world’s top oil exporter would ensure full oil supply commitments to its customers this month. 
“Over the past two days we have contained the damage and restored more than half of the production that was down as a result of the terrorist attack,” Prince Abdulaziz told a news conference in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. 
He said the kingdom would achieve 11 million bpd capacity by end of September and 12 million bpd by end of November.  
“Oil supplies will be returned to the market as they were before 3:43 a.m. Saturday,” he said, adding that state oil giant Aramco had emerged “like a phoenix from the ashes” after the attack. 
He was referring to attacks on Saturday on state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco’s plants in Abqaiq and Khurais, including the world’s largest oil processing facility, which shut down 5.7 million barrels per day, which is more than half of Saudi Arabia’s production, or 5% of global output. 
Aramco’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser said the company, which is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), was still in the process of estimating repair work but that it was “not that significant,” given the company’s size. 
“We should be at our production (level) before the attacks on our facility by the end of September,” Nasser told the same news conference.  
Aramco had put out 10 fires in the span of seven hours after the “huge” assault, Nasser said. 
He said the company was in the process of bringing back oil refining to full capacity and that there were enough crude products to supply the local markets. Aramco’s crude oil inventories are more than 60 million barrels, he said. 
Speaking at the same news conference, Aramco’s Chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan, said Aramco’s IPO would be ready within the coming 12 months and that the kingdom was committed to the listing. 
Rumayyan said the IPO would “continue as it is” despite weekend attacks and that timing would depend on market conditions. 
Prince Abdulaziz said Riyadh did not yet know who carried out the strikes or why, adding Saudi Arabia would keep its role as a secure supplier of global markets. He said stricter measures needed to be taken to prevent further attacks, but did not elaborate. 
The foreign ministry has said that preliminary investigations indicated Iranian weapons were used in the assault, which authorities initially said involved drones.

Engadget
Facebook has unveiled the finished charter for its content oversight board, and it's evident that the social site wants to give the board at least some meaningful independence.  The new rules will let users appeal content decisions directly to the board instead of through Facebook's usual channels, and any decisions will be binding no matter who at Facebook disagrees with it, according to Mark Zuckerberg.  The charter also outlines how Facebook intends to keep the board independent throughout the overall process, and how it will choose and work on cases.
The board will be chosen from qualified and vetted candidates "outside of our normal channels," including through a recommendation portal that will let anyone suggest candidates.  There will also be an in-between trust that oversees pay and other day-to-day operations.  You'll see at least 11 members (Facebook wants 40) with each serving a maximum of three terms of three years apiece.  They'll be chosen on a range of criteria that includes not just relevant experience, but open-mindedness and impartiality.  It wants people from a wide range of cultural, political and religious backgrounds.
The board will have a specific process for handling cases.  A rotating case selection committee will choose cases to recommend, with at least one of them from the region where the complaint came from.  The board will choose the cases themselves, but general staff will choose the panel and case manager.  It'll be up to the board and its staff to determine if more research is needed.  Facebook will just be there to supply information when requested.  Draft decisions from the panel will be circulated to the whole board, which can call for a fresh review if a majority objects to the outcome.
All decisions will go into a database that will serve as precedent for future decisions, much like traditional court systems.
The oversight board won't hear cases until the first half of 2020, although you should hear about its first members before 2019 is over.
If all goes according to plan, the board should help Facebook settle disputes over controversial decisions in a more educated and objective fashion.  As TechCrunch mentioned, though, this could also help Facebook's leadership wash its hands of responsibility if a decision proves unpopular or leads to regulatory trouble -- don't blame us, it's the board's fault.  Facebook can also decide just how broadly to apply the precedents set by case decisions, so the outcome may not always sync with expectations.  Even so, it's a start that could help it address the many, many disputes that have come up over the years.

Apple has announced that it's investing $250 million into display glass supplier Corning, on top of the $200 million it put in in 2017. The money will help Corning develop glass technology that's "specific to Apple," including "state-of-the-art glass processes, equipment and materials integral to the delivery of next-generation consumer devices," Apple wrote. That includes new types of glass for the iPhone, Watch and iPad. The money will come from Apple's Advanced Manufacturing Fund aimed at promoting jobs and technology development in the US.
Since dabbling in sapphire for iPhones and Watches some years ago, the company has stuck closely with Corning as its main glass supplier. The announcement is timely for Apple, which has heavily promoted the toughness of its latest iPhone 11 Pro lineup with ads like the one below. "The newest iPhone models feature the toughest glass ever in a smartphone, as well as a back machined from a single piece of glass that allows for wireless charging," Apple wrote.
Apple notes that since the iPhone launched in 2007, it has spent nearly $3 billion with Corning on iPhone, Watch and iPad Glass. The investment also supports 1,000 Corning jobs specifically for Apple's business. Apple notes that it has spent the entire $1 billion initial Advanced Manufacturing Fund investment, and tapped 20 percent of the $5 billion it committed to spend after that. The other big chunk of that went to Finisar, the Texas-based company behind Apple's Face ID, Animoji and Portrait mode for selfies.

Times Now
India's premier defence research organisation, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), will provide critical technologies for India's first manned mission to space, set to be undertaken before the 75th year of Independence.
On Tuesday, the DRDO signed MoUs with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to offer technologies for the mission, including space food, survival kits for the crew, radiation protection equipment and parachutes.
The ISRO has set the target for a first human space mission, the Gaganyaan mission, by 2022. The ISRO plans to send three astronauts to space for seven days onboard Gaganyaan, a crew capsule, to be launched with the help of Geo-Synchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV). The mission is a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Defence Ministry officials said as part of the collaborative effort between the ISRO and the DRDO, human-centric systems required for the mission would be developed. A set of departments and laboratories working under the DRDO also signed MoUs with the ISRO.
On the occasion, DRDO Chairman G Satheesh Reddy said existing technological capabilities for defence applications would be customised to meet human space mission's requirements.
Earlier this month, the Indian Air Force made an initial short-list of test pilots to be sent onboard the Gaganyaan. The pilots have been chosen after clinical, radiological and physical tests. One of the three crew is expected to be a woman.

Jashodaben was leaving the city after a two-day visit to Dhanbad in neighbouring Jharkhand, a source close to the chief minister said.
Banerjee is scheduled to meet the prime minister on Wednesday in New Delhi, during which she would highlight various issues like funds that are due to the state.
“I go to New Delhi very rarely. This is a routine work. This time I am going to talk about funds that are due to West Bengal. I will also highlight issues like change of West Bengal’s name,” Banerjee had said before leaving for New Delhi.
Jashodaben on Monday, had offered puja at Kalyaneswari temple at Asansol in Paschim Barddhaman district of West Bengal. Asansol is around 68 kilometres from Dhanbad.

Reuters
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s parliament has revised the country’s marriage law to  lift the minimum age at which women can marry by three years to 19, a move welcomed by campaigners as a step towards curbing child marriage in the world’s biggest Muslim majority-country. 
All factions in parliament agreed the revision at a plenary session on Monday, according to a statement on its website.  
Indonesia is among the 10 countries in the world with the highest number of child brides, according to campaign group Girls Not Brides. 
One in four girls in Indonesia is married before they turn 18, according to a 2016 report by Indonesia’s Statistics Agency and the United Nations children’s fund UNICEF.  
“The society still encourages girls to get married in their teenage years, otherwise they will be considered spinsters,” said Masruchah of the National Commission on Violence Against Women. 
Masruchah, who uses one name, said the commission would have preferred 21 as the minimum age for marriage for men and women, when both are considered mature in terms of reproduction and economic stability. 
Indonesia previously allowed girls of 16 to get married or younger — with no minimum age — if their parents requested it.  
Indonesia’s Constitutional Court ruled in December that it was discriminatory to have a lower marriage age for women than for men, who could legally marry at 19. 
Child marriage in Indonesia has been blamed for causing maternal and infant deaths, as well as encouraging child labour, Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection Minister Yohana Yembise said in a statement. 
“Finally, after 45 years (of the existing marriage law). This is a present for Indonesian children,” she said.

Reuters
NEW DELHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - India is looking at raising oil imports from Russia, its oil minister said on Tuesday, at a time of surging oil prices after an attack on Saudi Arabian facilities halved the kingdom’s production. 
Russia is jostling to capture market share in fast-growing India against rivals Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates. 
Dharmendra Pradhan said he had met the chief executive of oil producer Rosneft and that four Indian companies planned to increase their investment in Russian oilfields. 
“Today I met excellency Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft. We elaborately discussed the possibility of oil imports,” Pradhan told reporters. 
In the wake of weekend attacks that have hampered Saudi Arabia’s oil output, the oil minister also attempted to calm nerves on supply, saying he was confident that India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer, had a diverse crude basket. 
Rosneft, the world’s largest listed oil producer by output, confirmed that a possible increase of oil supplies to Indian refineries had been discussed.

		             NEW DELHI :
State-owned trading companies such as State Trading Corporation (STC), Project and Equipment Corporation (PEC) and MMTC will be shut down one by one as “the government has no business of remaining in such businesses", trade minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday.
“Slowly the original purpose of these public sector units have come to an end. It’s not the business of the government to remain in such businesses. The government should not run companies only for gold imports. We have started the discussion and will close them down one by one," Goyal told reporters at the sidelines of an event.
Press Trust of India news agency on Monday reported that the government was planning to close down STC and PEC.
Shares of MMTC Ltd and STC fell 16.6% and 19.6% respectively on Tuesday while Sensex closed 1.73% down, and Nifty 50 1.69% down.
Dipti Lavya Swain, Corporate M&A lawyer & partner at HSA Advocates said that while Cabinet approval is still to come, Goyal’s comments seem to suggest that post internal approvals and actions taken pursuant to a due diligence process, these companies will mostly likely be wound up.
“As these companies have made equity investments, unless regulated by joint venture contracts, these may be sold as going concerns. Listed entities will have to follow SEBI process along with winding-up requirements. STC will have to be pulled out of NCLT vide a deal with it’s lenders. Other options like demerger and selective asset sale may be lengthy and complex, which the government may avoid, but (they) cannot be ruled out until the final processes are ironed out," he added.
STC in its 2018-19 Annual Report said it is facing a “severe liquidity crisis" as all the lender banks have reported STC’s account as a bad loan due to non-payment of interest on the banking limits availed by the company. “Therefore, at present, the Company has no banking limits, funded or non-funded, available with it," it said.

CricTracker
Former India batsman Dinesh Mongia has called time on his cricket career on September 17, 2019. Mongia is best remembered for being picked over VVS Laxman in the Indian squad for the ICC World Cup 2003 in South Africa, where the Men in Blue ended up as runners-up, after being defeated by Australia in the finals.
Mongia, who hailed from Punjab, made his debut for the state in 1995-96, was a prolific run-getter in the domestic circuit. The left-handed batsman was also a capable left-arm spinner who plied his trade effectively in the English county cricket as well, where he was signed by Lancashire in 2004 in place of Stuart Law and then in 2005, Leicestershire signed him for a full-time contract. He has also made appearances for the Lashings XI team as well.

Dinesh Mongia made 8028 runs in 121 FC matches at an average of 48.95 and the best score of 308* with 27 centuries and 28 half-centuries. He amassed 5535 runs in 198 List-A games with 10 centuries and 26 fifties. He made his India debut in 2001 in Pune ODI against Australia but came into prominence for his 159* against Zimbabwe in just 147 balls.
Kinks in his technique were exposed on tours to New Zealand and England and after a below-par performance in the 2003 World Cup, he was dropped from the team in 2005, with his last match coming against Bangladesh in 2007. He also appeared in India’s first-ever T20I match against South Africa in 2006. He played 57 ODIs making 1230 runs with one century and in the sole T20I, he made 38 runs.
However, his connection with the much-maligned Indian Cricket League (ICL), left him without much support once BCCI managed to force the unsanctioned league to draw its curtains down. “Those were hard days,” recalled Mongia, who was quoted as saying by The Hindu. Most players banned by the Board for their association with the ICL were granted amnesty but Mongia remained the lone cricketer who was kept out of the official circuit.
However, he was made a State selector by the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) last season, which he sees as amnesty from BCCI and is looking forward to taking up coaching assignments.

An Oregon man who has beaten cancer twice has won $4.6million in the state lottery. 
Stu MacDonald purchases a Megabucks ticket every week and each time his wife wishes him luck - but the one time she forgot he won.
'I am a very lucky guy,' MacDonald said. 'I have survived cancer twice and here I am. This is amazing.'

MacDonald chose to take the bulk sum payment of $2.3million and is left with $1.56million after taxes. 
He bought the ticket on September 7 from Ashley's Café in Bend and they will receive a one percent winning bonus of $46,000.
'We are thrilled to learn that we sold a Megabucks jackpot,' said Tezra Kong, manager at Ashley's. 'Some of the seller's bonus will go back to the team that strive to delight our guests every day here at Ashley's in Wagner Mall.'

Winning the lottery is probably rarer than beating cancer twice. 
A Mega Millions jackpot gives odds of around 1 in 300,000,000. You're more likely to become President of the United States.
But people will always have a crack at taking the life changing sums. Since 1985, Oregon Lottery players have won more than $38 billion in prizes.

India is currently hosting three-match T20I series and three-Test series against South Africa but much of the discussion in Indian cricket is around MS Dhoni and his future in international cricket. It’s been long that the former Indian captain was seen in the Indian team jersey. There were speculations over his retirement, which have not died yet.
The 38-year-old veteran stumper has not featured in Indian team since the World Cup 2019 semi-final exit. It was expected as his last assignment, before putting his guards down. However, the glove-man left everyone surprised by not only deciding against retiring but also taking a two-month break. After West Indies Tour, it looked that he might make a comeback against South Africa but he made himself unavailable for this series as well.

Recently, a throwback tweet by Virat Kohli sparked the rumours of Dhoni announcing his retirement, which became the top trend on social media at that time, which was later explained by the Indian skipper in the press conference ahead of the first T20I against South Africa in Dharamshala.
Former Indian skipper, Sourav Ganguly, at a promotional event, was asked about the retirement of Dhoni, “I don’t know what the selectors think, what Virat Kohli thinks. They are the important persons, let them make the decision,” said Ganguly as quoted by Times Now.
Ganguly also praised the current Indian skipper over his performances and regarded him as the best batsman in the world but Steve Smith record also speaks for itself, “These are questions not to be answered. How does it matter? It’s about performance. Virat is the best in the world at the moment. So that’s what makes us happy. His records speak for itself. 26 Test hundreds are a phenomenal record.”
The Indian cricket team is currently lining up for the home series against Proteas and according to Dada, India is the favorites to win the series. Virat Kohli & Co. recently returned from West Indies, where they played ODI, T20I, Test series and remained unbeaten in all formats. India is yet to face a defeat inclusive of all the formats after returning from the World Cup 2019.

Lightning struck the pitch late on in the match between Wolmer’s Boys’ School and Jamaica College in Kingston on Monday.
Footage of the incident shows the moment of the strike, followed by two players falling onto their knees and clutching their heads.
The match continues for several seconds before fellow players and coaches realize what has happened and rush to the stricken footballers’ aid.
UPDATE: Schoolboy football organiser @ISSASportsJA is reporting that the two Jamaica College boys struck by lightning have been admitted to hospital. The second complained of chest pains. ISSA says tests were done and an ECG showed irregularities. Player being held overnight. pic.twitter.com/EczBu4TMys
Referee Karl Tyrell then called off the match as five players in total were affected, according to local reports.
Jamaica College player Terrence Francis and Dwayne Allen of Wolmer's were reportedly the most seriously injured and were taken to the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI).
Francis was seen being stretchered off the pitch after he failed to respond to treatment, while Allen was also said to have been hospitalized after complaining of chest pains.
Full details of the players’ current conditions have not yet been published, although the Jamaica Gleaner reports that Allen has since returned home while Francis is responding well to treatment but remains in hospital.

Amazon reportedly tweaked its product-search algorithm to favor products that are more profitable to the company. People who worked on the algorithm say the change could give Amazon's own brands a boost, The Wall Street Journal reports. If Amazon is intentionally using search to promote its own goods, it will likely draw more criticism from antitrust regulators.
WSJ sources said the algorithm was modified late last year, and that the unpublicized change was contested internally. The move supposedly pitted Amazon's Seattle-based retail business and its Palo Alto, California-based search team (referred to as A9) against each other. Several A9 employees say the retail team pressured them to surface Amazon products higher in the search results. To make things more complicated, the two teams used to report to separate CEOs, but both now report to retail chief Doug Herrington.
Amazon denies that it changed its search to factor in profitability or that it changed the way it ranked search results to favor its products. "As any store would do, we consider the profitability of the products we list and feature on the site, but it is just one metric and not in any way a key driver of what we show customers," a company spokeswoman said in an email to Engadget.
But promoting products that are more profitable could push customers towards Amazon's in-house products. Though, the search algorithm still takes other factors into consideration, and in some cases, third-party and brand-name products may still be more profitable for Amazon than its own products.
The news will likely raise concern among politicians and regulators. Amazon -- along with Apple, Facebook and Google -- is already being investigated as part of a federal antitrust probe. Apple recently tweaked its App Store search algorithm so that its apps weren't always ranked first, and the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for manipulating search results to promote its own products. Amazon has undoubtedly justified the algorithm change. Whether or not regulators will agree is unclear.
Update 9/16/19 4:00PM ET: This story has been updated to include a statement from Amazon.
Update 9/16/19 4:10PM ET: The story was updated to clarify Amazon's statement. The company said it does not factor profitability into its search ranking. A spokeswoman says the company did not change its search rankings to favor its own products.

Hyderabad: A day after former Andhra Pradesh speaker and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader Kodela Siva Prasad Rao died, TDP supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu, on Tuesday, demanded that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conduct an inquiry into the death, which he said came as a “shock". Naidu alleged that the ruling YSR Congress Party-led AP government, led by chief minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, had harassed the deceased.
“Someone (Siva Prasad Rao) called ‘Palnadu Tiger’ was afraid. Someone who was a speaker, dying like this is very bad. Petty cases were also filed on him, apart from other cases filed over the shifting of furniture," said Naidu while addressing a press conference in Hyderabad after paying respects to the deceased. Earlier this year, Siva Prasad Rao has been booked by the AP police for alleged misuse of office furniture (shifting to his residence after demitting office).
Siva Prasad Rao was the speaker of the assembly between during the previous TDP-led government (2014-19). Naidu alleged foul play, saying that he could not believe someone like the deceased would commit suicide. “Letters from him to the current AP government clearly state that he was ready to pay for the office furniture, for which he asked the (current) speaker to calculate the cost," Naidu added, while reading out documents during the press conference.
In a diatribe against Jagan Mohan Reddy, Naidu said, “What is his background? The CBI has charge-sheeted (on various charges) him, every Friday he has to go to court and now he has asked for exception as he is chief minister. Even today his (Siva Prasad Rao) house is rented, look at Jagan Mohan Reddy, his house is a palace here (Hyderabad)." After the death, TDP MP Kesineni Nani took to Twitter, alleging that it was a murder.
Siva Prasad Rao died after he tried hanging himself on Sunday night at his residence in Hyderabad. He was rushed to the Indo-Basavatarakam hospital at Banjara Hills, where he was declared dead. While the Banjara Hills police first said it was a case of suicide, a case of suspicious death has been registered. “We are waiting for the post-mortem report," said a senior police official, who did not want to be quoted.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Tuesday sent Karnataka Congress leader D K Shivakumar, arrested in a money laundering case by Enforcement Directorate, to 14-day judicial custody.
Special judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar directed the ED to take Shivakumar to hospital first and to see whether doctor suggests admitting him there.
"It is directed that the accused be first taken to the hospital and only after his medical condition is opined to be stable, he be sent to judicial custody in Central Jail, Tihar. The accused is remanded to judicial custody till October 1," the judge said in the order.
The court has listed Shivakumar's bail plea for hearing on Wednesday at 3.30 pm.
The judge said that in case the MLA is admitted to the hospital, his custody be taken over by the Superintendent of Tihar jail and the doctors hand over his custody only on his discharge.
"In case, he is admitted in the hospital, his custody shall be taken over by the Superintendent Central jail, Tihar who shall provide guards for the accused. In case of his admission in the hospital, the doctors shall hand over his custody to the Superintendent, Central jail, Tihar only on his discharge," said the judge.

The judge also said that in case Shivakumar was taken to Tihar jail, then the authorities permit him to take his medicines subject to the approval of doctor on duty in the jail.
The court took into consideration the medical records of Shivakumar, which said that he suffered from hypertension and fluctuating blood pressure and has undergone angioplasty earlier and is on a heavy medical dosage.
The probe agency claimed in the court that his interrogation was yet to be completed and sought permission from the judge to question him during the judicial custody.
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) K M Nataraj and Special Public Prosecutors Amit Mahajan, N K Matta and Nitesh Rana, appearing for the ED, told the court that Shivakumar's health condition did not allow his effective questioning.
The Congress leader's counsels opposed the ED plea for judicial custody and sought his bail on medical grounds.
Senior advocates A M Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Shivakumar, submitted in the court that the MLA's health condition was very serious and he was close to a heart attack; therefore, he be granted bail.
The ASG told the court that Shivakumar was taken to hospital as directed by court and due to his aliment, his interrogation could not be continued.
Singhvi further said that only Rs 41 lakh was recovered from Shivakumar and not Rs 8.5 crore, as alleged by the ED and now surprisingly the figure has become Rs 143 crore.
He alleged that ED is biased and mala fide and is lying before the court about the investigation. The agency's claim about 317 bank accounts was only to spoil Shivakumar's image in media and public, he added.
Rohatgi, also representing Shivakumar and seeking bail for him, said he was a 7-time MLA and not a flight risk.
It is a case based on documentary evidence and there was no ground to keep Shivakumar in custody as he has no criminal antecedent, he said.
Rohatgi further said that this is a case of granting bail and the court can impose conditions; if not, then granting medical bail to Shivakumar should be considered.
Opposing the bail plea, ED said that it had taken care of his medical conditions.
It also alleged that laundering of money took place through bank accounts of the MLA and his family members.
Shivakumar, arrested on September 3 by the ED in a money-laundering case, was produced before the court Tuesday on the expiry of his custodial interrogation.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran held talks with a delegation from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, a week after peace talks between the United States and the Islamist insurgents collapsed. 
Iran said in December it had been meeting with Taliban representatives with the knowledge of the Afghan government, after reports of U.S.-Taliban talks about a ceasefire and a possible withdrawal of foreign troops. 
Last week, the U.S.-Taliban talks collapsed and fighting resurged. The two sides had been seeking to reach an accord on the withdrawal of thousands of American troops from Afghanistan in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.  
“In the framework of Iran’s comprehensive consultations with all parties in Afghanistan, a Taliban political delegation visited our country recently to discuss the latest developments in Afghanistan with...Iranian officials,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted as saying by state media. 
Mousavi did not give further details. 
The U.S.-Taliban negotiations, which did not include the Afghan government, were intended as a prelude to wider peace talks to end more than 40 years of war in Afghanistan. 
Majority Shi’ite Muslim Iran has long had close ties to Shi’ite groups in neighboring Afghanistan whose militias have fought the Taliban’s Sunni Muslim militants. 
But last year, Afghan government officials accused Tehran, which the United States says is trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan, of providing the Taliban with money, weapons and explosives. Iran denies that. 
In October, the United States accused Iran of providing military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban. Tehran denied this. 
Iran was at odds with the Taliban for most of the time the group ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, and massed troops on the border in 1998 after 11 of its diplomats were killed there. 
Tehran then armed factions that helped U.S.-led forces overthrow the Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Reuters
LONDON (Reuters) - Global daily currency turnover surged to a record $6.6 trillion, with London shrugging off Brexit uncertainty to extend its lead as the world’s dominant trading hub, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said on Monday. 
Foreign exchange markets had been shrinking when the BIS released its last triennial forex survey - considered the most comprehensive take on what is the world’s largest financial market - in 2016 as banks and hedge funds pulled back from trading. 
The latest edition, however, shows the market has bounced back with a hefty 29% jump in daily trading volumes from the $5.1 trillion recorded in 2016, lifted by huge growth in FX swaps activity, the rise of new proprietary and high-speed trading firms and more demand for emerging market currencies. 
But the topline increase in daily global FX turnover hides growing headwinds facing the industry. Among them is the rise of FX swaps used by banks and investors to hedge their currency exposure and which typically generate less revenue than plain old cash trading or highly complex and structured deals.  
The survey by the BIS, a central bank umbrella group, showed that spot, or cash, volumes continued to decline, slipping to 30% of all daily volumes from a peak of 38% in 2013. FX swaps, meanwhile, gained market share and totalled 49% of all volumes in April 2019, up from 47% in the previous survey. 
“Growth of FX derivatives trading, especially in FX swaps, outpaced that of spot trading,” the BIS said.  
Graphic: OTC foreign exchange turnover, here 
The BIS collated the data from volumes reported in April by nearly 1,300 financial institutions across 53 jurisdictions.  
In a separate survey, the BIS said the market for over-the-counter interest rate derivatives more than doubled to $6.5 trillion from $2.7 trillion in 2016, driven mainly “by increased hedging and positioning amid shifting prospects for growth and monetary policy”.  
The BIS said improved reporting contributed to the rise. Britain recorded the biggest share of daily turnover, accounting for $1 in every $2 of interest rate derivatives traded. 
The survey also showed the United Kingdom extending its dominance of the FX trading industry, defying sceptics who had predicted Britain’s 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union would damage London’s financial services sector.  
Foreign exchange is the crown jewel of London’s financial sector. Industry experts say the city’s convenient time zone and its grip on FX trading infrastructure and personnel mean the sector could emerge unscathed from all the Brexit uncertainty. 
The BIS said London’s share of daily volumes rose to 43%, up from 37% in 2016, while the United States’ share shrank to 17% from 20%. In Asia, growing volumes in Hong Kong offset weakness in Singapore and Tokyo. 
“This is testament to London’s long-standing global trading relationships, concentration of counterparties and continued investment in technology infrastructure,” said Dan Marcus, CEO of ParFX, an electronic spot FX trading platform.  
“From a foreign exchange perspective, there is no doubt that London remains a global centre of excellence.”     
Notably, mainland China registered an 87% increase in trading activity to become the eighth-largest forex trading centre, up from 13th in 2016. 
The dollar .DXY remained the world’s most dominant currency and was on one side of 88% of all trades. 
There was little change in the ranking of the major currencies and market shares, though lower volatility in dollar-yen JPY= trading led to a drop of 5 percentage points in the Japanese yen's share to 17%, keeping it in third place behind the euro. 
Graphic: Currency distribution of OTC FX turnover, here 
Sterling's GBP= share stood at 13%, unchanged from three years earlier despite prolonged bouts of Brexit-induced volatility, remaining ahead of the Australian AUD= and Canadian dollars CAD=. 
Emerging market currencies raised their share to 25%, up from 21% in 2016. The growth came from a jump in Hong Kong dollar trading HKD=, as well as in the Korean won KRW=, Indian rupee INR= and Indonesian rupiah IDR=, the BIS said. 
Despite Beijing's push to broaden international use of the Chinese currency in recent years, the survey showed the yuan CNY= rising in line with overall market growth, leaving it with a 4.3% market share behind the Swiss franc CHF=.   
The Mexican peso MXN= and Turkish lira TRY= - the latter suffering a currency crisis in 2018 - dropped in the rankings. 
Banks trading with “other financial institutions” - including nonreporting banks, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, institutional investors and official sector financial institutions - grew significantly to $3.6 trillion, 55% of the global total, BIS said. 
That included growing activity by smaller regional banks - reflecting their strength in FX swap activity - and hedge funds. Institutional investor participation, however, declined to 12% of global FX turnover from 16% three years earlier.

England captain Joe Root has advised the team management not to exert too much pressure on “special” talent Jofra Archer. The Barbados-born pacer has been impressive since making his international bow at the beginning this summer.
The 24-year-old took 20 wickets and bowled the Super Over in the final as England won the World Cup. He pocketed 22 wickets and rattled the likes of Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne and Matthew Wade in the Ashes 2019 as the series ended in a 2-2 draw. His 22 wickets included two six-wicket hauls.
“When I faced him in the nets against the red ball it was pretty clear he’d be something special,” Root was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.

“At times he might not always bowl at 90mph, but he will still go at 2.5 an over and create chances. Making sure we don’t expect him to average 12 over the next two-and-a-half years is important, but knowing he’s got that ability to turn a game on his own is exciting.
“One thing we can expect is he’s going entertain and he’s going to make things happen. He’s come in and been fantastic. He has a way of having a huge impact on the game. His spell [against Wade at The Oval] – you saw the way he changed the whole atmosphere at the ground.
“For someone right at the beginning of their career to have such a gift, it’s great to be able to captain that. I am very much looking forward to the rest of his journey.

“We’ve got to be careful not to expect too much of him. He’s a young guy, he’s still learning and I’m still learning how to get the best out of him as a captain.”
Coach Trevor Bayliss, who leaves the side, feels Root should use Archer for short bursts in Test cricket. “It is a delicate one with Archer as he will obviously be in every team,” said the Australian.
“I know Root relied on him for longer spells in this series but going forward I think it might be about shorter spells of four or five overs.”

Reuters
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand’s prime minister on Tuesday defended police for requesting information about minority Muslim students from universities around the country, after criticism of the move as discriminatory and illegal. 
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said the police request, which follows a series of bomb blasts in Bangkok in August that were blamed on Muslim suspects, was needed to build a national security database.  
An official letter from police, shared online by former rights commissioner Angkhana Neelapaijit, asked a university to supply information about the numbers, place of origin, sect affiliation and other details about Muslim-organized student groups. The name of the university was blotted out. 
“This is an interference to personal rights and a discrimination based on religion,” Angkhana said, adding that freedom of religion and the right to privacy were guaranteed by the Thai constitution. 
About 90% of Thais are Buddhist, though Muslims are a majority in three southern provinces bordering Malaysia. 
Prayuth said the move was necessary. 
“The police has already pointed out that this is for the creation of a data base on intelligence,” Prayuth said. “No rights have been breached. We cannot manage anything if we don’t have data.”

The New Indian Express
GENEVA: Tens of thousands of people have been displaced across Myanmar's Rakhine and Chin states this year, as the military battles ethnic Rakhine Buddhist rebels, a UN rights expert said Monday.
"Up to 65,000 people have been displaced by the conflict across northern Rakhine and southern Chin States since January," said Yanghee Lee, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights situation in Myanmar.
Myanmar's army has deployed thousands of troops there in recent months to try to crush rebels from the Arakan Army (AA), who are fighting for more autonomy for ethnic Rakhine Buddhists.
Presenting an update on the situation in the Asian country to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Lee pointed out that the military had been "using helicopter gunships against the Arakan Army."
"Both sides are accused of indiscriminate use of heavy artillery fire, gunfire and landmines in civilian areas," she said.
At the same time, humanitarian access "remains heavily restricted by the state government in conflict-affected townships, significantly depriving at least 100,000 people of assistance and basic services."
And "imposed curfews are preventing people from reaching livelihoods, medical treatment and safe passage," she warned.
Lee said in recent months she had continued to receive reports of civilians, including children, being killed, either because they were targeted or hit with indiscriminate fire in the region.
She also voiced alarm at "disturbing reports of ethnic Rakhine men being arrested by the military on suspicion of association with AA and held incommunicado for weeks", amid allegations of torture and deaths in detention.
Lee voiced particular concern over reports that as many as six villages have been burned since the end of June.
This, she cautioned, was also when the government suspended all mobile internet service in the region.
"The suspension cannot be justified under international law and is a violation of multiple rights," Lee said, calling on Myanmar to "lift the suspension immediately."
"The parties to the conflict must end their hostilities. The people of Rakhine have suffered enough."
The conflict-scarred Rakhine state was also the site of a deadly crackdown that in August 2017 drove some 740,000 minority Rohingya Muslims into Bangladesh.
A separate UN fact-finding mission into the rights situation in Myanmar warned in a report published earlier Monday that some 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar still face a "serious risk of genocide".
And Lee on Monday dismissed Myanmar's claims that it had done what was needed to repatriate the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.
"Myanmar has done nothing to dismantle the system of violence and persecution, and the Rohingya who remain in Rakhine live in the same dire circumstances that they did prior to (those) events," she said.
She pointed to satellite imagery revealing development of "34 camps, the precise purpose of which is unclear but they may be intended to detain the remaining Rohingya population and those who decide to return."

Elon Musk revealed that he hired a private investigator for $50,000 to back up his assertion in a 2018 tweet that a British caver was a “pedo guy."
Musk is now asking a judge to forgo a trial and a throw out a lawsuit by the caver, Vernon Unsworth, accusing the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. of defamation.
“By referring to Mr. Unsworth as ‘pedo guy,’ I did not intend to convey any facts or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia," Musk said in a court filing Monday. “Pedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up. It is synonymous with ‘creepy old man’ and is used to insult a person’s appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of pedophilia."
Musk revealed that one of his trusted aides commissioned a private investigator to conduct an investigation of Unsworth on Musk’s behalf.
“Musk’s motion is as offensive to the truth and the sworn testimony developed in this case as was his initial false and heinous accusation of pedophilia," Unsworth’s lawyer, L. Lin Wood, said in an email.
Musk’s legal team asked the judge to dismiss the case before a scheduled December 2 trial, arguing that a BuzzFeed article about his tiff with Unsworth and his tweets don’t meet the legal standard of defamation. They asked the judge to treat Unsworth as a “public figure" for purposes of the case, arguing that Unsworth must meet a higher-than-ordinary level of proof that Musk either knew his statements were false or that he was reckless in making them.
“Mr. Unsworth cannot establish a defamation case just because Mr. Musk insulted him on Twitter and sent a private email to a reporter," they wrote in the court filing. “The Constitution does not allow that."
In April, a federal judge in Los Angeles rejected Musk’s request to dismiss Unsworth’s case.
The spat between the two erupted after Unsworth dismissed the mini-submarine that Musk and employees at SpaceX had built to assist in the rescue of a group of Thai boys who were trapped in a flooded cave last year. Unsworth said in a television interview that the mini-submarine, which ultimately wasn’t used in the rescue, was a “PR stunt" and that Musk could “stick his submarine where it hurts."
The case is Unsworth v. Musk, 18-cv-08048, U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles).

Times Now
Andoya, Norway: A fisherman was shocked to catch a bizarre creature in Norway. Oscar Lundahl (19) caught the 'dinosaur-like' fish with bulbous eyes near Andoya island off northern Norway. 
A photo of the rare fish has been doing rounds on social media. The fish had enormous eyes that looked out of proportion with its tiny body.
"It was pretty amazing, I have never seen anything like it before. It just looked weird, a bit dinosaur-like. I didn’t know what it was but my colleague did." Oscar, a fishing guide for Nordic Sea Angling, said. He was fishing in 2,600 feet below the surface when he made the catch.
The unusual creature is a ratfish, whose Latin name, Chimaeras Monstrosa Linnaeus, is derived from a Greek mythical monster Chimaera that had the head of a lion and tail of a dragon.
The ratfish which dates back 300 million years are said to be harmless to humans. They feed on crabs and sea snails. It is believed that their giant eyes are developed to enable them to see in the darkness of the deep waters they live in.
Since the ratfish did not survive due to the sudden change in pressure, Oscar decided to take it home to eat.
In another incident, a two-headed timber rattlesnake was found in New Jersey on August 25. The snake which has two brains that act independently was found by two employees of the Herpetological Associates of Burlington County. Since the chances of the snake surviving in the wild were low, the Herpetological Associates decided to take the rare snake in its care.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi King Salman said on Tuesday that Riyadh was capable of dealing with the consequences of attacks on its installations. 
A statement issued after a meeting of Saudi Arabia’s council of ministers said the cabinet had reviewed the damage caused by the attacks on Aramco installations, and it called on world governments to confront them “regardless of their origin”.

New Delhi/Mumbai: A record gain in crude oil prices could further aggravate India’s fiscal situation and make it tougher for the government and the central bank to effectively combat a slowdown in economic growth.
With drone attacks on Saudi Aramco’s facilities causing the biggest ever disruption in oil suppliers, India is preparing to stem the impact of the price surge. Saudi Aramco has, however, assured India that it will honour its supply contracts despite the production cuts, Indian government officials said on condition of anonymity.
India’s current account and fiscal deficits could worsen if oil prices remain at the elevated level, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das warned on Monday.
International benchmark Brent crude futures soared as much as 19.5% to $71.95 per barrel. Some traders are speculating that oil prices may cross the $100 mark again. Crude prices hit a record $147 per barrel in July 2008.
The surge in oil prices comes at a time when the Narendra Modi government is trying to boost the economy after GDP growth slumped to the slowest in more than six years. An increase in inflation stoked by higher fuel prices will also leave less space for RBI to cut interest rates to combat the slowdown.
“India’s crude imports averaged 4.5 million barrels per day over the first seven months of this year, of which close to 20% were imported from Saudi Arabia. As such, India is vulnerable to prolonged lower crude supplies from Saudi Arabia even though the country has some SPRs (strategic petroleum reserves) and commercial crude stocks as cushions in the short term," Jy Lim, an oil market analyst at S&P Global Platts, said in an emailed statement.
India imports more than 80% of its oil requirements and around 18% of natural gas.

The crew of a North Korean vessel attacked Russian border guards as they tried to stop them from poaching, the FSB explained. Two North Korean fishing ships and 11 motor boats were spotted within the Russian exclusive economic zone in the Japanese Sea on Tuesday, according to the Federal Security Service (FSB), which oversees border security. 
As poaching is considered a criminal offence in Russia, one ship and its 21-member crew was detained, and a boarding party was sent to the second, presumably larger, vessel.
However, the second ship –carrying over 45 sailors– then attacked the border guards, with three officers injured in the melee, the FSB statement said.
As a result, both vessels were detained.
The clash, which occurred on Tuesday, follows a string of earlier incidents involving North Korean fishermen. Last week, border guards detained 16 boats and over 250 sailors who were poaching squid off Russian shores.

Russian Foreign Ministry said it was planning to summon North Korea's top diplomatic representative in Moscow.

Paul Pogba's brother has said it is common knowledge that Zinedine Zidane is a huge admirer of the Manchester United midfielder. 
The Frenchman was heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid in the summer but remained at Old Trafford. 
Zidane could not pull together the finances to persuade United to sell but may reignite his interest further down the line.

He told Radio Marca: 'Zidane wanted players, he didn't get them, but I have no doubt that he's going to do the work he needs to do in order to get the team back to the level he wants.
'I like Zidane and he likes my brother - everyone knows it.'
Zinedine Zidane may yet revisit a move for Pogba in January or next summer
Juventus were also linked with a move for Pogba in the summer but United were holding out for £150million. 
His agent Mino Raiola attempted to instigate a transfer and even said: 'Everyone knows the willingness of Paul to move on. We are in the process of that. Everyone knows what the feelings of Paul are.'

Reuters
LONDON (Reuters) - The days of James Anderson and Stuart Broad spearheading England’s fast bowling attack are over, according to former captain Michael Vaughan. 
The pair have taken more than 1,000 test wickets between them with Anderson’s 575 a world record for a pace bowler. 
The 37-year-old Anderson, however, managed only four overs in this year’s drawn Ashes series after aggravating a calf injury. 
Broad, 33, excelled despite the absence of his usual partner and took 23 wickets at an average of under 27. 
After more than a decade in which they have been used in tandem, Vaughan suggests playing one or the other is the way forward for England. 
“I don’t think it is right both of them play now,” Vaughan told BBC Radio 5. “It might be that Broad plays one series and Anderson plays one series. 
“They are not going to like it, but they are at that stage of their careers where England are going to have to manage the combination very smartly.” 
Vaughan also believes that England’s sole focus now must be in trying to regain the Ashes in Australia in two years’ time after drawing the recent series 2-2. 
“I want to see a disciplined way of playing and the World Cup is in the bag now,” Vaughan said. 
“The most important thing going forward is the Ashes in two years. It is the Test team that needs a real focus over two and a half years of real dedication and structure.”

TechCrunch
Google  will reveal the next Pixel in greater detail at an event happening October 15 in New York, the company confirmed via invites sent to media today. We already know the Pixel 4 will be revealed at this event, because Google has already dropped some official images and feature details for the new Android smartphone, but we’ll probably see more besides, given that the invite promises “a few new things Made by Google.”
Here’s what we know so far about the Pixel 4: Everything. Well okay, not everything, but most things. Like it’ll use Google’s cool Soli radar-based gesture-recognition technology for both its updated face unlock and some motion controls. Infinite leaks have shown that it’ll have a body design that includes a single color/texture back, what looks like a three-camera rear cluster (likely a wide-angle, standard and zoom lens) and a 6.23-inch OLED display on the XL with image resolution of 3040×1440, with a 90Hz mode that will make animations and scrolling smoother.
The animation Google sent out with the invites for its 2019 hardware event

It also has rather large top and bottom bezels, a rarity for smartphones these days, but something that Google apparently felt was better than going with a notch again. Plus, it has that Soli tech and dot projectors for the new face unlock, which might require more space up top.
In terms of other hardware, there are rumors of a new ChromeOS-based Pixelbook, plus new Google Home smart speakers. We could also see more of Stadia, Google’s cloud gaming service that launches in November. Google also could show off additional surprises, including maybe Chromecast updates, or an update to Google Wifi to take advantage of the newly certified Wi-Fi 6 standard.
Basically, there could be a lot of surprises on hand, even if the Pixel 4 is more or less a known quantity, and we’ll be there to bring you all the news October 15 as it happens.
Google’s Pixel 4 smartphone will have motion control and face unlock

Reuters
MEXICO CITY / NEW YORK (Reuters) - Popular dating app Tinder has wrapped filming on its first television series, as owner Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) seeks to dive deeper into creating original content, people with direct knowledge of the project told Reuters. 
Making new shows is part of a larger strategy that will be revealed in the near future, a spokeswoman told Reuters, declining to elaborate on the plans. The source familiar with the production said it is Tinder’s first foray into creating an online platform for scripted video content. 
The multi-episode series centres on an “apocalyptic” storyline and includes a relationship sub plot but is not directly connected to Tinder’s core dating app business, the source said. It was filmed in Mexico City in late August. 
Tinder’s move should not be a big surprise given its ownership. Parent company Match is majority owned by IAC, founded by Hollywood legend and IAC (IAC.O) Chairman Barry Diller. 
Last October, Tinder launched a lifestyle website called Swipe Life to publish original content including articles and videos about dating and relationships.  
Offering original content is an increasingly popular strategy for the mostly U.S.-based technology and retail industries that have already attracted millions of devoted users. Walmart Inc (WMT.N) is working with MGM to boost Walmart’s Vudu video service. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) has also considered video plans to keep customers interested in the brand. 
The strategy seeks to engage users on a deeper level even when they are not using the service. That could help Match hold on to its rapidly growing customers. Its shares have risen more than 75% this year as it continues to add subscribers.   
Reuters reported in April that Airbnb Inc, the start-up for booking home rentals around the world, has ambitions to develop a slate of original shows to whet customers’ appetite for travel. 
For several years, Airbnb has considered various ideas for creating or licensing mini-series and documentaries about travel, and shows featuring Airbnb homes, guests and hosts, according to the Reuters story. 
It was not clear when Tinder’s first series will launch or how Match Group will promote it.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the latter's residence in New Delhi on Wednesday, 18 September.
Addressing the media after the meeting, she said that the demand for West Bengal's name change to Bangla was brought up.
The meeting assumes significance as Banerjee has been one of the harshest critics of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Modi, with acrimony between the two leaders reaching a high during this year's Lok Sabha elections.
The last time Banerjee and Modi met was at the Visva Bharati University convocation at Shantiniketan on 25 May 2018. She did not attend Modi's swearing-in in May when he took over charge for the second time and stayed away from the Niti Aayog meeting in June.
A day before the meeting, Banerjee had described her scheduled meeting with PM Modi as a "courtesy" visit, saying that she would highlight various issues like funds that are due to the state.
Talking to reporters at Kolkata airport on Tuesday, Banerjee had said she would also raise issues like name change of the state as well matters like merger of public sector banks during the meeting.
“I go to New Delhi very rarely. This is a routine work. This time I am going to talk about funds that are due to West Bengal. I will also highlight issues like change of West Bengal’s name,” Banerjee had said before leaving for New Delhi.
"Will also talk about matters like merger of public sector banks, issues with Air India, BSNL, Railways where there are several problems. They (employees of these organisations) cannot go anywhere and come to us," she had added.
The BJP, which won 18 out of a total of 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal, only four less than TMC's tally of 22, is eyeing to defeat Banerjee's party in the 2021 state Assembly polls.

Lucknow: After all six BSP MLAs switched over to the Congress party, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the grand old party, terming it “fraudulent”.
Mayawati tweeted, “The Congress party government in Rajasthan has once again proved to be a non-trustworthy and fraudulent party. This is a breach of trust as the BSP has given unconditional support to the Congress government in Rajasthan.”
Coming down heavily on the Congress party, Mayawati, in a series of tweets, asserted, “Instead of fighting against its arch-rivals/organizations, Congress always works to hurt those parties that support them. The Congress is thus an anti-SC, ST, OBC party and has never been sincere and honest about the right to reservation of these classes.”
The former UP chief minister also accused the Congress of opposing BR Ambedkar’s humanitarian ideology, saying “that is why he had to resign as the first law minister of the country”.
“Congress has always been opposed to Babasaheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar and his humanitarian ideology. For this reason, Dr Ambedkar had to resign as the first law minister of the country. The Congress neither allowed him to go to the Lok Sabha nor conferred with Bharataratna. Very sad and embarrassing,” Mayawati retorted.

The New Indian Express
BAHRAICH: Terming human trafficking the "most heinous crime", BJP MP Akshaibar Lal said on Monday that the Centre is mulling the possibility of fencing the Indo-Nepal border to curb such illegal activities.
"It has been discussed in Parliament several times like the fencing on the Pakistan border. Can we not have it here so that no one can make illegal entry?" Lal said.
He said fencing the Indo-Nepal border is necessary and the Centre is thinking about it. Lal was speaking here at a workshop of 'Indo-Nepal stakeholders to end human trafficking' as the chief guest.
The BJP MP said, "Human trafficking is the most inhuman crime and should be checked effectively".
"Human trafficking is an international issue for which, besides the government, social groups and defence forces will also have to work jointly," Lal said.
"As a people's representative, I am committed to finding a solution to this problem," the Bahraich MP said.
Lal said he will soon meet the Union home minister and the defence minister and put forward the suggestions given by the stakeholders during the workshop.
Sashastra Seema Bal DIG Abhishek Pathak, who was a special invitee to the workshop, said checking human trafficking is among the priorities of the SSB and it has been continuously working in this direction.
Besides, the representatives of different social welfare organisations of India and Nepal and representatives of UNICEF also took part in the workshop.
Seven districts of Uttar Pradesh - Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Siddharthnagar, Maharajganj, Lakhimpur and Pilibhit- share an open border with Nepal, which is often used for illegal activities.

Reuters
WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States believes the attacks that crippled Saudi Arabian oil facilities last weekend originated in southwestern Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters, an assessment that further increases tension in the Middle East.  
Three officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the attacks involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating that they involved a higher degree of complexity and sophistication than initially thought. 
The officials did not provide evidence or explain what U.S. intelligence they were using for the evaluations. Such intelligence, if shared publicly, could further pressure Washington, Riyadh and others to respond, perhaps militarily. 
Saudi state television said the Saudi Defense Ministry will hold a media conference on Wednesday that will show evidence of Iran’s involvement in the Aramco attacks, including the use of Iranian weapons. 
Iran denies involvement in the strikes. Iran’s allies in Yemen’s civil war, the Houthi movement, claimed responsibility, saying they struck the plants with drones including some powered by jet engines.         
U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said it looked as if Iran - which has a long history of friction with neighbor Saudi Arabia - was behind the attacks.  
But in a sign that U.S. allies remain unconvinced, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said he was unsure if anyone had any evidence to say whether drones “came from one place or another.” 
French President Emmanuel Macron telephoned Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday to discuss the attacks, Saudi state news agency SPA reported. Macron said France was willing to help international investigators, it added. 
Saudi Arabia sought to reassure markets after the attack on Saturday halved oil output, saying on Tuesday that full production would be restored by month’s end. 
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out talks with the United States unless the Trump administration returns to the nuclear accord between Iran and the West that the United States abandoned last year.   
“Iranian officials, at any level, will never talk to American officials ... this is part of their policy to put pressure on Iran,” Iranian state TV quoted him as saying.  
Trump on Tuesday said he is not looking to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during a U.N. event in New York this month. 
U.S.-Iran relations deteriorated after Trump quit the nuclear pact and reimposed sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear and ballistic programs, severely hurting the Iranian economy. Trump also wants Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including Yemen’s Houthis.     
Iran’s clerical rulers openly support the Houthis, who are fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, but Tehran denies that it actively supports the Yemeni group with military and financial support.  
Despite years of air strikes against them, the Houthi militia boasts drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia, the result of an armament campaign pursued and expanded energetically since Yemen’s war began four years ago. 
Another senior Trump administration official said the Houthi claim to have used 10 drones in the attacks was undercut by the fact that Abqaiq was struck at least 17 times. The second location, he added, was hit at least twice by precision-guided munitions.

The New Indian Express
MANILA: Twenty people, including children, were killed Tuesday in the southern Philippines when the flatbed truck they were riding in plummeted into a ravine, police said.
The vehicle was bringing a group of people home from a trip to the beach when the driver lost control near the town of T'boli in the latest deadly crash on the nation's dangerous roads.
"Based on eyewitness accounts, the truck lost its brakes.
We will conduct further investigations on the actual cause," T'boli town police investigator George Tabayan told AFP.
Police initially put the death toll at 15, but doctors said five of the 19 people taken to hospital for treatment later died, Tabayan said, updating an earlier tally.
The dead included children aged between one to six years old, with the driver among those injured, he added.
The group had come from a swimming party at a beach in a neighbouring town and were on their way home when the accident occurred.
Deadly road accidents are common in the Philippines, where inadequately maintained buses and poorly trained drivers form the backbone of land transport options.
In June, 13 people including a bride-to-be were killed when the truck they were riding on after attending a traditional pre-wedding ceremony rolled over on a mountain road.

Times Now
Ahmedabad: A Gujarat man escaped a hefty fine even after riding a two-wheeler without a helmet. The traffic cops stopped Zakir Mamon, a fruit shop owner in Bodeli town in Chhota Udaipur district, for not wearing a helmet. However, when Zakir told his problem to the cops, they were surprised.
Zakir's head is too big to fit in a helmet. He has not been able to find a helmet in the market that can fit on his head.
"I respect the law and I want to follow it by wearing a helmet but I have visited all the shops which sell helmets but could not find any helmet which can fit onto my head. I keep all relevant documents with me but as far as helmet is concerned, I am helpless. I have told the police about my unique problem," Zakir said.
Zakir's family worries that because of the head-size problem, he would have to pay hefty fines every time he steps out of the house on his motorcycle.
However, the police understood his problem and did not penalise him. "It is a unique problem and we have not fined him as we understand his issue. He is a law-abiding person and keeps all relevant documents while driving," Vasant Rathva, Assistant-Sub-Inspector, Traffic Branch, Bodeli town, said.
Last week, the Gujarat government reduced the penalties levied by the amended Motor Vehicles Act citing that the fines laid down in Act are maximum. The fine for riding a two-wheeler without a helmet has been brought down from Rs 1,000 to Rs 500.
In another incident, a Vadodara man had pasted his driving license, insurance slip, PUC certificate and his bike’s registration on his helmet.
Another man from Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh was spotted wearing a helmet while driving his car. He had claimed that he received an e-challan of Rs 500 on August 27 for driving his car without a helmet.

Times Now
Mumbai: Urmila Matondkar, who abruptly quit the Congress on September 10, on Tuesday dismissed reports which claimed that the Bollywood actress is planning to join Shiv Sena ahead of the 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Elections.
“I am not joining any other party. So, it is a kind request to the media to kindly not to share whatever they hear. It is unfair towards me, to say the least, and also not appropriate towards any party,” said Matondkar in a statement.
Matondkar's statement comes in the wake of a report which alleged that she recently held a meeting with the personal assistant of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.
Ruling out speculations, Matondkar said her talks with Milind Narvekar was just a “courtesy meeting”.
Matondkar had joined the Congress on March 27 and contested the Lok Sabha Elections from Mumbai North constituency. However, she faced defeat at the hands of sitting Bharatiya Janata Party MP Gopal Shetty.
Last week, Urmila Matondkar took everyone by surprise when she suddenly snapped her ties with the Congress, alleging 'betrayal' by the party. She has, however, stayed mum on her future course of political action. 
"I hereby resign from the Indian National Congress (INC) as a member and from any post held in the INC. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to work for INC," said Matondkar in a brief letter addressed to Congress' interim president Sonia Gandhi. 

In the letter, dated September 7, the actor-turned-politician said she first thought of resigning from the party when -- despite her continuous attempts -- no step was taken following her explosive letter dated May 16 to the former Mumbai Congress president Milind Deora. Notably, the nine-page letter was 'leaked' in early July.
"Thereafter, to my utter dismay, the said letter containing privileged and confidential communication was conveniently leaked to the media, which according to me was an act of blatant betrayal," said Matondkar.
She further said she raised concerns over the issues time and again but it seemed nobody from the party was either regretful or concerned for the leak of the letter.
She added that her "political and social sensibilities" refused to let vested interests in the party use her as a means "to fight petty in-house politics".
"I stand by all my thoughts and ideologies and will continue to work for the people to the best of my capacity with honesty and dignity. I thank all the people who helped and supported me through my journey," she concluded.

Ben Stokes had an amazing past two months as a cricketer as he helped England lift their maiden ODI World Cup trophy and then played an amazing inning in the Leeds Test against Australia, to help his team win the match and keep the Ashes 2019 alive. He was great with both the bat and ball. However, the all-rounder has come down heavily on irresponsible journalism of English daily newspaper The Sun.
The Daily published an article which revealed sensitive information about the Kiwi-born cricketer’s family and their past which has a sad incident. The story deals with how Stokes’ sister and brother, Tracey, eight, and Andrew, four, were murdered by his mother’s ex before the birth of Ben. The England star and his family have never spoken about the incident publicly ever.

Ben’s mother Deb was previously married to Richard Dunn and when the two separated, Dunn was furious to know that Deb had gotten along with Rugby coach Gerard Stokes. He had the custody of Tracey and Andrew and shot them both dead before turning the gun on himself in April 1988. The Sun mentioned that the birth of Ben gave his mum “something to live fore”, as per family sources.
However, Stokes has slammed the newspaper for invading their privacy by sending a reporter to his parents’ house in New Zealand and question them about this upsetting event in their life that they had forgotten about. “Today the Sun has seen fit to publish extremely painful, sensitive and personal details concerning events in the private lives of my family, going back more than 31 years,” Stokes posted on Twitter in a long statement which can be read below.
“This is the lowest form of journalism, focussed only on chasing sales with absolutely no regard for the devastation caused to the lives as a consequence. It is totally out of order. The article also contains serious inaccuracies which have compounded the damage caused. We need to take a serious look at how we allow our press to behave. Despite the fact that this has now been made public, I do please ask all concerned to respect my family’s privacy and right to home life,” Stokes wrote on his Twitter handle.

 
Stokes is currently on a break from cricket after helping England draw the Ashes 2019. He scored 441 runs from the five Tests at an average of 55.12, including two hundreds, and took 8 wickets. He scored a magnificent 135* at Leeds, Headingley to help England chase down 359 runs when they were 280 odd with nine wickets down.

TechCrunch
Computer scientist and open software advocate Richard Stallman said he has resigned from his position as a visiting scientist at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) after describing a victim of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein as “entirely willing” in emails sent to a department list. Stallman has also stepped down from his roles as president and board director at the Free Software Foundation, the nonprofit he founded in 1985.
Last week, the Daily Beast reported that Stallman had also called for the legalization of child pornography and abolishment of age of consent laws on his personal blog in multiple posts published over the course of 15 years.
In his MIT CSAIL resignation, also posted to his personal blog, Stallman wrote: “To the MIT Community, I am resigning effective immediately from my position in CSAIL at MIT. I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings.”
MIT has been under scrutiny for its ties to Epstein, whom a New Yorker investigation found had secured $7.5 million in donations for the MIT Media Lab, far more than what was previously disclosed. As a result, its director, Joi Ito, resigned last week and MIT ordered an investigation into the Media Lab’s ties to Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell last month while awaiting federal trial on sex trafficking charges.
As part of its preliminary findings, MIT president Rafael Reif admitted that the law firm conducting the investigation had uncovered a letter he wrote to thank Epstein for a donation in 2012, four years after Epstein had already pleaded guilty to procuring for prostitution a girl under 18. “I apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency,” Reif wrote. “Although I do not recall it, it does bear my signature.”
Stallman’s emails were first made public last week by mechanical engineer and MIT alum Selam Jie Gano (the entire thread was later published by Vice). In an email sent to a MIT CSAIL mailing list earlier this month, Stallman wrote that Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s sex trafficking victims, who testified that she had been ordered to have sex with late MIT professor Marvin Minsky during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands when she was 17, had likely “presented herself to him as entirely willing.” He also wrote that “I’ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is absolutely wrong to use the term ‘sexual assault’ in an accusation.”
Gano also published an email that Stallman sent to another CSAIL list that included undergraduate students. In it, he said “I think it is morally absurd to define ‘rape’ in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.”
In response to a request for comment, an MIT CSAIL spokesperson forwarded TechCrunch a copy of the email CSAIL director Daniela Rus sent to the department informing them of Stallman’s resignation:
Dear CSAIL colleagues,
I am writing to let you know that today Richard Stallman submitted his resignation from the lab, effective immediately. In the weeks ahead, we will work with him to come up with a transition plan.
We thank him for his technical contributions to the lab, to the free-software movement, and to the wider computer-science community over the decades.
Recent events have also prompted me and other senior leadership at the lab to focus on having a discussion on how we can improve the ways we respectfully work with one another in this community. This includes ongoing conversations about the future of the CSAIL-related listserv.
My team will continue to keep the community informed of our progress.
Daniela Rus

The News Minute
It was indeed his lucky day. A man (who is yet to be identified by the police) was standing near his two-wheeler in Engapuzha town in Kozhikode, when a private bus was approaching towards him. The bus first hit a few two-wheelers parked near him and knocked him and his vehicle down.
A CCTV visual that has now emerged shows the man’s miraculous escape even as the bus almost ran him over. The man’s bike is first hit by the bus and is dragged forward. The bus continues to move a short distance, dragging the man with it. His left leg is caught between the front wheel and the chassis of the bus. The man then uses his hands to crawl along with the moving bus until it finally came to a halt.
While people who witnessed this freak accident looked on with shock, they also saw something that further stunned them: the man managed to get out from under the bus when it halted and then limped to a shop nearby. He miraculously survived the accident, with injuries to his knee.
The incident took place on Monday morning near Puthuppady Engapuzha bus stand in Kozhikode. As per the CCTV footage, the private bus, which was coming from Kodenchery route, can be seen approaching towards the line of bikes parked near the bus stand as a Kerala State Road Transport (SRTC) bus travels past it. The private bus then knocks down a few bikes, including the man’s bike. 
Speaking to TNM, an official at the Thamarassery police station in Kozhikode said that the brakes of the private bus failed and as a result, the driver lost control of the vehicle. “We have taken the bus in custody,” he said.
Apart from the man who made a miraculous escape, three others have been injured, including the driver and conductor of the bus.
Two days after the incident, the police are yet to take the statement of the man. They are even yet to identify the name and address of the man, who is currently undergoing treatment at a government hospital. 
Warning: Viewer discretion advised

Kerala recently saw another incident of miraculous escape involving a 13-month-old child. The toddler fell from the jeep while her parents were asleep. The incident took place near Rajamala check post when the vehicle was passing through a reserve forest. The child crawled to a ticket counter of the Forest department several meters away.

Daily Mail
A newborn zebra foal with unusual polka dot markings has been photographed in Kenya - the first of its kind to be seen in the Maasai Mara National Reserve.
Antony Tira, a tour guide and photographer at Matira Bush Camp, spotted the black dotted foal while observing the park's game reserve near the Mara River.
He told the Daily Nation he initially thought the newborn zebra had been captured and marked 'for the purposes of migration'.
Antony Tira, a tour guide and photographer at Matira Bush Camp, spotted the black dotted foal (pictured) while observing the game reserve near the Mara River in Kenya
But, on closer inspection, the photographer realised the young foal - which remained close to its mother - had a melanin disorder. 
'At first I thought it was a zebra that had been captured and painted or marked for purposes of migration. I was confused when I first saw it', he said. 
Melanism - the opposite of albinism - is caused by a build-up of dark pigmented melanin in the skin.
The photographer said he initially thought the newborn zebra had been captured and marked 'for the purposes of migration'
But, on closer inspection, Mr Tira realised the young foal - which remained close to its mother - had a melanin disorder
A melanistic zebra is one whose stripes haven't developed properly, the Star reported, and instead has a pattern of small stripes and spots across its skin.
Photographs of the rare foal captured the newborn's dotted markings across its neck and chest. The zebra also has an entirely black back and thin white stripes on its legs. 
It was reported that a 'stampede' was caused in the Maasai Mara National Reserve by the discovery as tourists and guides rushed to the park to observe the rare zebra.
Melanism - the opposite of albinism - is caused by a build-up of dark pigmented melanin in the skin. The condition is hereditary and is caused by the mutation of genes. 
Melanism is found in various different species, including mammals, reptiles and amphibians. 
The black jaguar, for example, was once believed to be a separate species, but it was later found to be a melanistic version of a jaguar.
A melanistic zebra is one whose white stripes haven't developed correctly on its skin. 
Pseudo-melanism, also called abundism, is a variant of the condition which causes large dark spots or stripes to appear across the skin.

 Parmale Lemein, a wildlife specialist at Matira Camp, told the Daily Nation there has never been any recorded case in the Maasai Mara of a zebra with such rare markings.
He said melanistic zebras had, however, been spotted at other parks in Africa - none of which had survived six months.
The photographs were also shared by well-known blogger Mutuma Untamed, who said the 'week old' foal had been named after the photographer who discovered it.
On Facebook, he wrote: 'Did you know, last week a Maasai guide discovered a one of a kind hybrid baby zebra in the Maasai Mara. It is named after his surname - Tira.
'A few years ago there was a similar case, however that zebra still maintained the stripes and brush-like tail. 
'Rare Tira, however has patterns that appear as polka dots.'

To further reduce its already scant presence in the Indian market, American vehicle manufacturer General Motors Company, on Monday announced an agreement wherein Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) – country’s largest software exporter - will acquire certain assets of the Bengaluru based technical centre of the vehicle manufacturer and 1300 employees of the company will be come under the rolls of TCS.
This will also be the one of the most significant steps taken by TCS in the space of future mobility and other aspects of the automotive industry.
“Under the terms of the agreement signed earlier today, TCS will acquire certain assets at the GM Technical Center – India (GMTC-I), in Bengaluru, and will partner with GM in supporting its global vehicle programs with engineering design services over the next 5 years. Over 1,300 employees of GMTC-I will transfer to TCS, including teams focused on propulsion systems, vehicle engineering, controls development, testing, creative design and special projects," noted spokes persons of both companies in a press release issued.
As losses kept increasing due to massive decline in vehicle sales in India, General Motors decided to stop selling vehicles in the domestic market in May, 2017. The company now exports vehicles from its manufacturing capacity based in Maharashtra, while its second plant based in Gujarat was sold to Chinese vehicle manufacturer SAIC Corporation – the parent company of M G Motor India Pvt Ltd.
“TCS has been an outstanding partner for 16 years. We are pleased to evolve our partnership even further, as we work to deliver on our commitment to create a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion," said, Dan Nicholson, vice-president electrification, controls, software and electronics, General Motors.
The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of month. General Motors established he technical centre in 2004 in Bengaluru and contributes to the company’s global programs, across propulsion systems, vehicle engineering, controls development, testing, creative design and special projects. It also houses a design studio and an engineering center with in-house electronics hardware and software testing and validation infrastructure.
“Next generation automotive R&D is a key focus area for TCS, given the criticality of product innovation and connectedness in the Business 4.0™ world. This new partnership with General Motors is a testament to our willingness to invest in the relationship for the longer term," said Susheel Vasudevan, Global Head, Manufacturing Business Group, TCS.

Times Now
Bhopal: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and veteran Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday stoked yet another controversy when he said that "people are wearing saffron clothes and raping". 
"A person after parting ways with his family becomes a sadhu (monk)...and turns to spirituality. But today people wearing saffron robes are selling 'churan' (fake potions)," he said.
"Today, people are wearing saffron clothes and raping. Rapes are happening inside temples, is this our religion? Those who have defamed our 'Sanatan Dharma (ancient religion)', not even God will forgive them," said Singh while addressing the Sant Samagam organised by the Madhya Pradesh Adhyatmik Vibhag (Spiritual Department) in Bhopal.
Such acts are "unforgivable", added Singh.
The event was attended by saints from across Madya Pradesh. Narmada Mandakini trust chairman Computer Baba also participated in the event.
While Digvijaya Singh did not take any name, his comments come at a time when the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) is investigating rape allegations against BJP leader Swami Chinmayanand by a law student in Uttar Pradesh.
The former Madhya Pradesh CM also said that the 'Jai Shri Ram' slogan has been hijacked by those having political interests.
"The slogan should, in fact, be Jai Siya Ram. When we raise the slogan in the name of Lord Ram, why do we forget Sita?," said Singh.
Hitting out at Singh, BJP’s Madhya Pradesh spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said that the veteran Congress leader has again insulted saffron.
“If someone is a criminal or accused of a crime, then the entire saffron band does not become suspicious. Will now the same idea be expressed about the costumes of clerics and priests?” Agrawal said while slamming MP Chief Minister Kamal Nath. 
Agrawal sought clarification whether the conference was called to insult them.
Late last month, the senior Congress leader had triggered controversy when he had accused the BJP of receiving money from Pakistan's spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).
"Bajrang Dal (the youth wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad) and Bharatiya Janata Party are taking money from the ISI. Attention should be paid to this," Singh had said.

		             MUMBAI :
Mumbai: Tata Power Co. Ltd Tuesday said it will exit a South African wind power joint venture by selling its entire stake to a local partner for $106 million. The deal is likely to be completed in the third quarter of this financial year.
Cennergi (Pty) Ltd, which owns two wind power farms totalling nearly 230MW, is an equal joint venture between Exxaro Resources Ltd, a leading South African coal producer, and Khopoli Investments Ltd, a subsidiary of Tata Power. After the transaction, Exxaro will own 100% of Cennergi.
“The decision to monetize this South African asset is in alignment with our stated strategy to deleverage the balance sheet by divesting sub-optimal size international assets," Praveer Sinha, Tata Power’s chief executive officer and managing director said in a statement.
The share purchase agreement with Exxaro Resources was executed for ZAR1,550 million ($106 million), subject to normal working capital and other adjustments, the statement added.
Cennergi owns the Amakhala Emoyeni wind farm with a generation capacity of 134.4 MW and 95% shareholding. It also owns the Tsitsikamma Community wind farm comprising 95.3 MW and a 75% shareholding. Each project has a 20-year power purchase agreement with the state power utility Eskom.
“The proceeds from such sale would be re-invested in emerging areas where there is a huge growth opportunity. The company will focus on renewable power, power distribution and service-led businesses in India which will bring in greater value and help us align with the emerging consumer needs", Sinha said in the statement.
ABSA Bank was the sole advisor to Khopoli for the transaction.
“The collaboration between Exxaro and Tata Power over the past seven years to develop these projects to their current status has been commendable and an outstanding success in South Africa’s implementation of its energy strategy. As a South African-based company, Exxaro is pleased with this opportunity to consolidate its interest in this renewable energy asset at a time in South Africa where we need energy security as we respond to increasing negative sentiment towards coal-based electricity generation," said Mxolisi Mgojo, CEO of Exxaro Resources.

Pinkvilla
In the last six years, a lot has happened in the Jiah Khan case. After the actress committed suicide, there were severe allegations leveled against Sooraj Pancholi, who was in a relationship with the Housefull actress back then. A case has been running in Court with the matter being subjudice. Jiah's mother Rabiya Khan has accused the Hero actor of serious criminal offences but the Pancholis had maintained a stoic silence on the issue ever since.
Watch the full interview right HERE.     
 
In our latest episode of No More Secrets, we had Sooraj joining us for a conversation with his mother Zarina Wahab. Recalling the whole incident, Sooraj said, "I was put in the Anda cell at the Arthur Road jail which is the most secluded cell. You have no contact with anyone and you don't even get newspapers. I was completely numb. At that point, nothing mattered. All that I kept thinking was that I lost someone who I loved." 
The case is in the Special Women's Court for years now. The actor is present for every hearing whereas Jiah's mother Rabiya has hardly been part of any hearings. "I have actually been silent because I respect that family. I respect what the family has been through. But the media has become very irresponsible. They only care about their TRPs There are times when I'm in Court and things have been in my favour and a lot of journalists were there. I asked them, "Will you write this?" They told me they won't because it's a positive story and it won't track. It's unfair but I also believe in time."

New Delhi [India], Sept 17 (ANI): Allaying concerns over the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday said that neither a single shot has been fired nor has anyone died there till now and asserted that there is peace in the valley. "From August 5 till now, we did not have to fire a single shot and not even a single person has died. There is peace in Kashmir," said he said at an event here. .Last month, Parliament had passed the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganization) Act, 2019, bifurcating the state into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir with legislature and Ladakh without it.The BJP chief said that many people had called the surgical strikes in 2016, a "fluke",but they now "certify" the country's defence policies after it revoked the provisions of Article 370."Even though surgical and airstrikes give immense joy to the people, taking such decisions needs immense courage. The airstrikes changed the way the world looks at us now,' Shah added.Shah also took a dig at the erstwhile Congress government and said that during their tenure, there used to be news of corruption every day, borders were insecure, soldiers were beheaded, women felt unsafe and people protested on the roads every day."A government was running where every minister considered himself as Prime Minister but did not look at the actual Prime Minister as one," he scoffed.Shah said that unlike the erstwhile government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government never took any decision for "vote bank" but rather for the benefit of the people."Some governments work for 30 years and take one big decision, but our government worked for five years and took over 50 major decisions, including GST, demonetisation, airstrikes, etc. No one else dared take it during their tenure," said the Union Minister.Shah said that India is growing economically, adding that the agriculture sector and the per capita income are also increasing. "We are progressing towards becoming a $5 trillion economy and I am confident that it will happen before 2024," he added. (ANI)

Reuters
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union’s order to Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14 billion) in back taxes “defies reality and common sense”, the U.S. firm said as the two sides sparred in a case key to the EU’s crackdown on sweetheart deals to multinationals. 
The iPhone maker is appealing to Europe’s second highest court to overturn the European Commission’s 2016 ruling that it pay the record sum to Ireland. 
Ireland, whose economy has benefited from investment by multinational companies attracted by low tax rates, is also challenging the Commission’s decision. 
Apple also accused the Commission of using its powers to combat state aid “to retrofit changes to national law”, in effect trying to change the international tax system and in the process creating legal uncertainty for businesses. 
The EU executive dismissed the arguments, saying it was not seeking to police international tax laws and accused Ireland of not having done its homework when assessing Apple’s taxes. 
Apple’s arguments at the General Court, Europe’s second-highest, came after the EU executive in 2016 said the tech giant benefited from illegal state aid due to two Irish tax rulings which artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades. 
The case could make or break European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s campaign which has also led to action against Starbucks, Fiat, Engie, Amazon and others. 
Apple’s Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri led a six-strong delegation to the court where a panel of five judges will hear arguments over two days. 
“The Commission contends that essentially all of Apple’s profits from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two branches in Ireland,” Apple’s lawyer Daniel Beard told the court. 
“The Commission contends that essentially all of Apple’s profits from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two branches in Ireland,” Apple’s lawyer Daniel Beard told the court. 
He said the fact the iPhone, the iPad, the App Store, other Apple products and services and key intellectual property rights were developed in the United States, and not in Ireland, showed the flaws in the Commission’s case.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban insurgent group claimed responsibility for two blasts which it said killed dozens of people in Afghanistan on Tuesday. 
The suicide attacks targeted Afghan security forces, the group’s spokesman said. 
The explosions, in the capital Kabul and central province of Parwan, killed at least 30 people and injured 45 others, according to police and health officials.

Reuters
COLOMBO (Reuters) - The grand opening of Sri Lanka’s tallest tower was mired in controversy on Monday when President Maithripala Sirisena said one of the Chinese firms contracted to work on the project had disappeared with $11 million of state funds. 
Sirisena made the allegation at the launch ceremony of the China-financed Lotus Tower, a 356.3-metre (1,169 ft) construction in the shape of a lotus bud featuring a revolving restaurant, conference hall and observation area. 
The Chinese embassy in Colombo did not respond to requests for comment. 
The tower, overlooking Beira Lake in central Colombo, is expected to become a major tourism attraction. 
Sirisena said that in 2012, under his predecessor former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the state-run Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) had deposited 2 billion rupees ($11.09 million) with Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co. Ltd (ALIT), a Chinese firm chosen as one of the main contractors. 
“In 2016, we found ALIT had disappeared. We investigated into this and the Sri Lankan ambassador in Beijing went to the address of ALIT personally on my instruction to find there was no such company,” Sirisena said in a speech. 
“This is the money we could have spent for development of this country, for education, and medicines of patients.”  
Sirisena’s audience at the opening ceremony included Chinese envoy to Colombo Cheng Xueyuan. It was not possible to approach the Cheng at the ceremony for comment and officials at China’s embassy in the Sri Lankan capital did not respond to text and WhatsApp messages. 
It was not immediately possible to contact ALIT via phone or email. 
Sirisena had suspended most of the Chinese-backed infrastructure projects started under Rajapaksa when he came to power in 2015 over allegations of corruption, overpricing and flouting government procedures. 
But more than a year later, the Sirisena government allowed Chinese projects to resume after a few changes in some of them. 
China’s Exim Bank in 2012 agreed to lend 80% of the total investment of $104.3 million in the Lotus Tower, with the rest to be met by TRC.  
TRC in a statement said Chinese firms China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CEIEC) and Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co. Ltd (ALIT) were chosen as the main contractors. 
Sirisena said the government had started repayment of the loans made, but more funds were needed to complete the project.     
Chinese investment has become controversial in Sri Lanka, which is struggling with expensive external debt and where growth is expected to slump to its worst level since a contraction in 2001. Tourism, the country’s third largest foreign currency earner and fastest growing sector, was also hit hard by Islamist militants attack in April. 
Sirisena’s Lotus Tower allegation also comes ahead of a presidential election later this year.  
Political sources close to Sirisena and Rajapaksa have said talks between the president’s center-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Rajapaksa’s Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) for a coalition deal have broken down.

Employees' Provident Fund Organisation or EPFO is likely to soon credit interest into accounts of its 6 crore subscribers for 2018-19.  Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar today said that over 6 crore EPFO members will get 8.65% interest for 2018-19, according to Press Trust of India. Last month, the labour minister had said that the  labour ministry will soon notify 8.65% rate of interest on Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) for 2018-19 as the finance ministry does not disagree on this rate. 
Earlier this year, the EPFO's (Employees' Provident Fund Organisation) apex decision-making body Central Board of Trustees, headed by the labour minister, had decided to raise the interest rate on EPF to 8.65% for the year 2018-19, the first increase in the past three years.
"The finance ministry does not disagree with 8.65% interest on EPF for 2018-19. I believe that it will soon be notified," Gangwar had said on the sidelines of a FICCI meet last month. 
A notification by the labour ministry is required for EPFO to credit the interest amount into accounts of over 6 crore subscribers. It would enable retirement fund body Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to settle on withdrawal claims on this rate.
Currently, the EPFO is paying an interest rate of 8.55% for 2018-19 under EPF  withdrawal claims. The 8.55% interest rate on EPF deposits was fixed for 2017-18.
After the finance ministry's concurrence, the labour ministry can notify the rate of interest for 2018-19. Thereafter, the EPFO gives directions to its over 136 field offices to credit the rate of interest into subscribers' account and settle their claims accordingly.
For 2018-19, EPFO had raised interest rate to 8.65%, from 8.55% provided in 2017-18. The EPFO had earlier reduced the interest rate for 2016-17 to 8.65 per cent as compared with 8.8% for 2015-16.

Indian market indices Sensex and Nifty continued to remain under pressure for the second day on fears that surging oil prices could impact economic recovery. At day's lows, the Sensex fell over 700 points to 36,419 while Nifty slumped below 10,800. The Indian rupee also extended losses today, falling to 71.71.78 against the US dollar. Banking, auto, metal and IT stocks led the losses in Indian markets today. Market volatility India VIX, which is commonly known as fear gauge, surged 7% to 15.99. At the close, Sensex settled at 36,481, down 642 points, while Nifty ended 1.7% lower at 10,817.
Here are 10 updates from India's stock markets:
1) Hero MotoCorp slumped 6.2%, Tata Motors 5%, Axis Bank 4.8%, Tata Steel 4.6%, Maruti Suzuki 4.4%, SBI 3.7%, and Bajaj Auto 3.4%. HDFC, M&M, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank fell between 2% and 3%.
2) Analysts say that a jump in oil prices could hurt the recovery in the economy after GDP growth for the June quarter fell to a six-year low of 5%.
3) India's current account and fiscal deficit could take a hit if oil prices continue to rise after the attack, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said on Monday.
4) Oil prices remained near 4-month highs today with the market remaining on tenterhooks over the threat of a military response to attacks on Saudi Arabian crude oil facilities that halved the kingdom's output and prompted a price spike. Saudi Arabia is the world's top oil exporter and has been the supplier of last resort for decades.
5) On Monday, the oil prices surged nearly 20% in intraday trading in response to the attacks, the biggest jump in almost 30 years.
6) "The sharp surge in crude oil prices has definitely impacted sentiments as it has an adverse impact on Indian economy. Going forward, investors would keep a close watch on geo-political developments as any further escalation could take oil prices even higher and it would be detrimental for Indian markets and economy," said Ajit Mishra vice president for research at Religare Broking.
7) Also on the radar is US Fed's policy announcement tomorrow. However, Mishra says that commentary on growth and rate outlook would be a key factor to watch out for. On the domestic front, he adds, the recent announcements of new measures to boost economy are positive, but the expectations of GST rate cut are high, especially for the auto sector.
8) "The GST meet is scheduled on September 20. Hence, given the current scenario, we expect the markets would remain volatile in the near term," he added.
9) Oil marketers BPCL, Indian Oil and HPCL extended losses to a second day, shedding 2.5% to 4%.
10) Trading companies MMTC Ltd plunged 17% and State Trading Corporation of India Ltd tanked 20% today after trade minister Piyush Goyal today said the government will shut down state-owned trading companies such as State Trading Corporation (STC), Project and Equipment Corporation (PEC) and MMTC one by one as "the government has no business of remaining in such businesses".

Times Now
 It was 2013 when actor Varun Sharma tickled the funny bone of the audience for the first time with his role of Choocha in his debut film Fukrey. Since then, he has never looked back and has managed to create a laugh riot in the theatres every time he appears on the screen.


Yet, from Fukrey onward, in films that followed including Dolly Ki Doli, Dilwale, Fukrey Returns, Arjun Patiala and his latest release Chhichhore, Varun has mostly donned the avatar of the goofy funnyman in his career spanning over six years. Does he he fear he could be getting typecast?

"In today's time it is a big task to be cast in good projects with good cast on a regular basis -- so typecasting comes much later. I enjoy comedy. I genuinely like to make people laugh. It is one of the toughest things to do," Varun said.

"Today, almost everyone is busy. Everyone is so occupied that they hardly get time to laugh their fullest. So, I feel blessed that through the medium of cinema, I can bring a smile on someone's face. Also, Comedy is the genre that has given me an acceptance and an identity. So, I don't fear of getting typecast and I won't stop doing comedy roles just because I have done too many," Varun told IANS.

The 29-year-old, however, feels it is important to explore other genres as well.

"I am not a comedian, I am an actor. So it is vital for me to become a versatile artiste who explores all kinds of roles and genres. I love crime, I love sci-fi -- and many other things. I want to showcase different shades to my fans. I really want to do a negative or a dark role," he said.

Varun is currently garnering a lot of praise for his role of Sexa, a sex-obsessed engineering student in Nitesh Tiwari's "Chhichhore". For him, it would be among his biggest achievements if fans now start calling him "Sexa", just as he has been "Choocha" to many fans for long.

"Recently I went to a Ganesh Chaturthi event and a fans came up to and addressed me as Sexa. It felt great! You know it's a beautiful feeling when an actor is called by his character's name. It rarerly happens that characters get embedded in the minds and hearts of the audience. Choocha was one such character -- it is a role close to my heart. I made my debut with it and I got so much love for it. I am glad that Sexa is matching that popularity. Within a short time, I have played two beautiful characters that are embedded in people's hearts. Touchwood, from Choocha to Sexa, it has been a great journey so far, and I hope for the best because there's still a long way to go," Varun added.

HTC announced that it has appointed a former executive from telecom giant Orange, Yves Maitre, as its new CEO. The company said that current chief Cher Wang will step down while remaining chairperson of the company. Wang took over the position from Peter Chou back in 2015.
HTC will continue to focus on VR and XR (extended reality), 5G and AI with Maitre at the helm. In the press release, Maitre said that HTC "will set out immediately to continue the transition from building the worlds' best consumer hardware to also building complete services around them to make them easy to manage and deploy."
That likely means that HTC will continue to develop business services around the Vive VR headset, much like Microsoft did with Hololens. The company recently announced an agreement with a company called Synnex "to provide enterprise resellers with HTC VIVE solutions designed for markets including architecture, construction and engineering; product design; healthcare and medicine; and education," it said in its latest financial statements. It also recently unveiled a 5G Hub, developed with Sprint, that will let consumers get 5G speeds without a 5G phone.
HTC's finances have been a mess lately, so Maitre has his work cut out for him. In 2018, the company brought in a mere $770 million in revenue, the first time it saw less than $1 billion as a public company. HTC sold off a chunk of its smartphone business to Google last year, but its Vive business has struggled too, as virtual reality hasn't yet gained strong traction with consumers. If HTC's woes continue, Maitre might be its last CEO.
Update 18/9/2019 1:58 AM ET: HTC told Engadget that it disagrees its finances are a "mess," despite seven straight years of revenue decline, and gave the following comment:
HTC has zero debt and a healthy balance sheet. We have spent the past two years re-positioning the company for the future of 5G, VR and AI and we believe those investments will pay off substantially.

The bright future of Cognizant India will see us building the industry’s most admired delivery engine, blending efficiency with innovation. That future will also include attracting and developing even more of the best talent, strengthening our brand and reputation, and ensuring the highest levels of ethics, compliance, and governance."
Humphries said in his 21-plus years with the company, Ramkumar has played a leading role in developing many of their India-based portfolios, including marketing and communications, market research and intelligence, public affairs, and knowledge management, along with spearheading the activation of their corporate purpose through the work and generosity of Cognizant Foundation and Cognizant Outreach.
“In the weeks ahead, Ramkumar will be establishing both a Management Committee and an Operating Committee for India. These committees will help us further strengthen our operations in the country, proactively advance our agenda as we engage with the media and government, drive greater diversity and inclusion throughout our organization, and extend our corporate citizenship efforts and our reputation as an employer of choice as we work to accelerate Cognizant’s topline growth. As our new Head of India Operations, Ramkumar will have all of the country’s location heads and corporate function leaders as dotted-line reports," Humphries said in his note.
Humphries said India is a “prized asset" of Cognizant, adding that he has two scheduled visits to India in the next three months and he expects the executive committee to keep visiting India. “In coming quarters, we plan to extend our outreach and engagement with the Indian media and government institutions. I look forward to working more closely with Ramkumar and ensuring that Cognizant’s standing is positioned appropriately in all circles as we reestablish our company’s momentum," he said.

Separate attacks by suicide bombers – one targeting Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani's election rally and a second that ripped through the center of the Afghan capital – killed at least 48 people and wounded scores more on Tuesday, 17 September, in the deadliest single day since a peace agreement with Taliban insurgents was declared dead.
In that explosion, 26 people were killed, according to Nasrat Rahimi, spokesperson for the Interior Ministry. Four among the dead were Afghan military personnel, he said. Another 42 people were wounded, many of them women and children.

In the second bombing, just hours later in the heart of Kabul not far from the US Embassy, the Taliban said they were targeting an Afghan army base. They killed 22 people, government officials said. Scores more were wounded.
The violence comes as Afghanistan faces presidential elections on 28 September – a vote the Taliban vehemently oppose. The insurgent group has warned Afghans not to vote in the election and said their fighters would target election campaigns as well as polling stations.
The bomber, who attacked Ghani's rally, detonated his explosives at the entrance to the rally, according to Hamed Aziz, a spokesperson from Ghani's campaign office. But Aziz said the explosion occurred some distance from where Ghani was addressing a crowd of about 2,200.
Ghani condemned both attacks.
There were many women and children among the casualties in the bombing near Ghani's rally, said Qasim Sangin, a local official.
Local television footage of the attack showed twisted wreckage and charred remains of military and police vehicles that were apparently positioned near where the powerful blast occurred.
Firdaus Faramarz, spokesperson for the Kabul police chief, said the attack in the heart of the Afghan capital took place near Massood Square, a deeply congested intersection in the centre of Kabul. NATO and US compounds are located nearby as are several Afghan government ministries.
Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, released a statement to the media saying Taliban suicide bombers were behind both attacks.
In Parwan, Mujahid said the bomber targeted presidential guards who were protecting Ghani and the rally, along with other members of the security forces. Four military personnel were among the dead.
Campaigning for the Afghan elections resumed last week after US President Donald Trump declared that the US-Taliban talks, which have been going on for months in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, are over.
Most presidential candidates had suspended their campaigns while negotiations were taking place and as the US peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, said a deal was all but signed.
Ghani, who had been sidelined during much of the talks between Khalilzad and the Taliban, resumed campaigning immediately and had been steadfast in his demand that presidential polls should take place.
Khalilzad and some of Ghani's rivals, however, had talked of establishing an interim administration to run the country while a peace deal was implemented.
In the aftermath of the scrapped talks, Afghans braced for what many expected to be an increase in violence. The Taliban have refused to discuss a ceasefire and have stepped up attacks across the country.
Meanwhile, Afghan forces backed by their US allies have intensified raids on militant hideouts in recent weeks.
The Taliban have also refused to meet with representatives of Ghani's government for talks but it was two attacks in Kabul in recent weeks that caused Trump to halt the negotiations with the Taliban, including one that killed two NATO soldiers, one of whom was an American. Another US soldier died in combat in Afghanistan on Monday.
Monday's death was the 17th US combat death in Afghanistan this year, according to the Pentagon's count. There also have been three non-combat deaths this year. More than 2,400 Americans have died in the nearly 18-year war.
On Tuesday, the Afghan Taliban were in Iran visiting officials in Tehran, while last week they were in the Russian capital holding consultations with Zamir Kabulov, President Vladimir Putin's envoy for Afghanistan.
Iran's semi-official Borna news agency on Tuesday quoted the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry there, Abbas Mousavi, as saying the Afghan delegation discussed "the latest" developments with Iranian officials.

Times Now
Mumbai: When international pop divas Katy Perry and Dua Lipa come crooning to India at the OnePlus Music Festival, they will have a battery of local new-age talent to complete the line-up for what promises to be the country's biggest live music extravaganza of the year.
Apart from Perry and Dua Lipa, fans at the fest will gets a chance to groove to the rhythm of as diverse musical minds as Amit Trivedi, Ritviz, The Local Train and Aswekeepsearching. The announcement of the full line-up for the festival, to be held on November 16 at Mumbai's DY Patil Stadium, came on Tuesday.
Perry and Dua Lipa will, of course, be the main draw. Perry, who made her debut in 2008, has an enviable record of racking up a cumulative 35 billion streams besides a global sales figure of 45 million-plus (adjusted) albums and 135 million tracks.
For Dua Lipa, the transition from modelling to music proved a win-win deal. Hits such as New rules, One kiss, and Scared to be lonely made her a global sensation in just around four years, since she released her first single, "New love" in 2015.
While Amit Trivedi -- composer of numerous hits in films including Dev.D, Udta Punjab, and Queen -- is a familiar draw for those aware of mainstream Bollywood music, the festival will let the buffs savour plenty of unconvetional whiffs, too.
The OnePlus stage will also be a platform for 22-year-old Pune wonder Ritviz to flaunt his EDM quirk, and there will be the Delhi rock band, The Local Train, too.
The post-modern rockers, Aswekeepsearching, complete the line-up. They will aim at setting the mood with their distinct mix of soulful instrumental riffs and solid vocals.
"I'm really looking forward to performing at the OnePlus Music Festival. This is going to be a first of its kind platform with a fantastic set of artists, and I'm really glad to be joining the celebration," said Trivedi.
For The Local Train a chance to perform at the fest is special because it gives them the "honour to be able to perform on the same stage with icons like Katy Perry and Dua Lipa".
Ritviz felt it's a big deal to be oart fo such a line-up of artists because "each one of them has carved a unique path for themselves", while for Aswekeepsearching the show was a dedication to "all the love and support by OnePlus to aswekeepsearching".
Tickets to the music festival will be available starting today at 12 p.m. Tickets are priced Rs 3,000 onwards, and OnePlus users can avail a 10-per cent cashback from their Insider and PayTM accounts.

The Quint
In a politically significant development in Rajasthan, all six Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs have given a letter to the state Assembly speaker to merge the legislative party with the Congress.
"The BSP MLAs met me and handed their letter about this," Speaker CP Joshi told PTI on Monday, 16 September night.
"All the six BSP MLAs were in constant touch with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and today (Monday) they have came into the fold of the Congress," a Congress leader said.
The Rajasthan Assembly has 200 seats. The Congress has 100 MLAs and its ally Rashtriya Lok Dal has one, giving it the majority to run the government.
The Congress also has the outside support of 12 out of total 13 independent MLAs. Two seats are vacant.
In 2009, during Gehlot's earlier tenure, all the six BSP MLAs had defected to Congress. That time, the government was five short of a clear majority.
BSP President Mayawati hit out at the Congress after the development, saying that the Congress party has once again proved that it is "unreliable" and "untrustworthy".
The six BSP MLAs in Rajasthan defected to the ruling Congress on Monday night. The development came ahead of civic body polls and bypolls for two assembly seats.
In a tweet, Mayawati said, "The Congress government in Rajasthan has once again broken BSP MLAs and proved that it is an unreliable and untrustworthy party".
Terming it a "betrayal", Mayawati said that this move comes at a time when the BSP was extending unconditional outside support to the Congress.
"Congress, instead of fighting against its bitter opponents and organisations, always works to harm those parties which cooperate with/support them. The Congress is thus an anti-SC/ST OBC party and has never been sincere and honest about the right to reservation of these classes," she said in another tweet.

TechCrunch
The We Company, beleaguered parent of the short-term real estate property management and development company WeWork and other We-related subsidiaries, has issued a statement that says it “expects” to complete its initial public offering by the end of the year. The note all but confirms that the company is indeed delaying its IPO roadshow, which had been expected to commence this week.
“The We Company  is looking forward to our upcoming IPO, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year,” the statement notes. “We want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment.”
We’s plans for a $20 billion public offering have been hampered by questions about its corporate governance and the ultimate value of a company that private investors, through multiple rounds of funding, once thought was worth nearly $50 billion.
But under the scrutinizing spotlight of the IPO process, investors have been publicly and privately balking at that sky-high valuation and the company’s questionable governance practices under chief executive officer and co-founder, Adam Neumann, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news that The We Company would put its offering on hold. 
Over the past few weeks, The We Company — which has expanded to include a boutique hotel operation, members-only financial services and a charter yacht service (!) — has made several moves to allay investors’ concerns. The company unwound some particularly egregious transactions with Neumann and added new directors. It also moved to limit Neumann’s power at the company.
And last week, the company amended its prospectus to include the appointment of an independent lead director. It also slashed the strength of Class B and Class C shares so Neumann would not have 20 times the voting power of other shareholders, and removed Neumann’s wife from succession planning at the company. And then SoftBank, to shore up the IPO value, reportedly was prepared to buy at least $750 million in additional shares in the process.
But eve all these drastic steps were not enough to comfort Wall Street investors. Not even the attempts to slash the company’s valuation to below $10 billion could attract enough investor interest to the public offering. And the opacity of The We Company’s reporting and metrics likely did nothing to help matters in the eyes of the investing public.
Now, with the We Company delaying its listing, and with Uber and Lyft solidly underperforming in their first year as public companies, we may finally be reaching a long-awaited moment of reckoning.
After years of rapid value growth in the tech world, spurred in part by venture capital firms placing sky-high valuations on their portfolio companies as ever-more cash was piled into them, perhaps the tsunami has finally hit land. If so, it’s not going to be pretty and there may be more to come. Perhaps it’s time to relearn the lesson that greed may not actually be good.
WeWork and Uber are proof valuations are meaningless

The News Minute
The wait just got longer for the 17 disqualified Karnataka MLAs, who had approached the Supreme Court to quash their disqualification, with one of the judges recusing himself from the case.
According to reports, Justice MM Shantanagoudar recused himself citing that he was from Karnataka even as all parties in the case said they did not have objections. But Justice Shantanagoudar insisted that his conscience is not permitting him to hear the case. 
Justice Shantanagoudar before being elevated as a Supreme Court judge in 2017 has served in Karnataka in various positions in the state. While starting his legal career in Dharwad, he had practised extensively in Bengaluru and became the Chairman of Karnataka State Bar Council and also the Public Prosecutor of Karnataka. He was appointed as an additional judge in the Karnataka High Court in 2003 and became a permanent judge within a year. He went onto become the Chief Justice of Kerala High Court before he was elevated to the Supreme Court.

Read: Wait for disqualified MLAs in Karnataka grows, SC rejects urgent hearing again
The case will be heard by a different bench on September 23.
Earlier on September 12, an SC bench led by Justice NV Ramana had declined an urgent hearing on the matter.
The 17 include Pratap Gouda Patil, BC Patil, Shivaram Hebbar, ST Someshekhar, Byrati Basavraj, Anand Singh, R Roshan Baig, Muniratna, K Sudhakar, MTB Nagaraj, Shrimant Patil, Ramesh Jarkiholi, Mahesh Kumatahalli and R Shankar from the Congress and JD(S) legislators AH Vishwanath, Gopalaiah and Narayana Gowda.
 These MLAs of the former JD(S)-Congress combine had resigned from their positions to pave way for the BJP to form a government in the state.
Initially represented by former Attorney General of India Mukul Rohatgi, they had approached the apex court to quash and set aside former Speaker Ramesh Kumar’s order dated July 28, 2019, which rejected the resignations of the rebels and instead disqualified them. The disqualification order states that the 17 MLAs cannot contest elections until the term of the Assembly is over. This means that the 17 rebels will have to wait for the upcoming Assembly polls in 2023.
The MLAs are hoping for a favourable verdict as they want to contest the bye-elections in the 17 constituencies, which are due to be held within six months since the disqualification.
If their disqualification is not set aside by the Supreme Court, then their prospects of getting inducted into Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa’s cabinet could be affected.

Times Now
Agartala: Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Monday claimed that those who are opposing Hindi as the 'rashtra bhasha' (national language) do not love the country.
He, however, made it clear that he was not against English or was not trying to impose Hindi.
"The people who are opposing Hindi as the national language are those who have no love for the country.... I am supporting Hindi as the national language as most of the people of our country speak Hindi," the chief minister said.
Had the Britishers not ruled India for 200 years, there would have been no use of English in official works in the country, he said.
According to the Official Languages Act, 1963, Hindi and English are the official languages for the Union government and Parliament.
A total of 22 languages of the country are recognised under the Eight Schedule of the Constitution.
Supporting Union Home Minister Amit Shah's assertion on Saturday that Hindi as a language can unite the whole country, Deb said, "Due to loyalty to the colonial rule, English became a status symbol for many people."
"It is not that only English speaking nations progress. Had it been the case, countries such as Germany, China, Japan, Russia and Israel would have not developed," the chief minister said.
He also urged government officers to help people in official works, who does not understand English and can speak only regional languages.
"I have seen that if anyone comes for any help in government offices and speak in Bengali or Kokborok, officials take time to help them. But as soon as you request him in English, they do it quickly. This should not be done," the chief minister said.
Inaugurating the "Atal Bihari Vajpayee Regional Cancer Centre" here, Deb, who also holds the health portfolio, said more super specialty hospitals would be set up soon and Tripura would be a medical hub.
The government has spent Rs 120 crore in setting up the cancer hospital here, he added.

Reuters
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have seized a vessel in the Gulf for allegedly smuggling 250,000 litres of diesel fuel to the United Arab Emirates, Iran’s semi-official Students News agency ISNA reported on Monday. 
“It was detained near Iran’s Greater Tunb island in the Persian Gulf...the crew have been handed over to legal authorities in the southern Hormozgan province,” ISNA said,     without elaborating on the nationalities of the crewmen. 
The reported seizure coincided with raised international tensions following a weekend attack on a major oil installation in Saudi Arabia, Tehran’s longtime regional foe. 
Responsibility for the strike was claimed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, while the United States has blamed Iran itself for the strike. Iran denies the accusation.  
Iran, which has some of the world’s cheapest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and the fall of its national currency, has been fighting rampant fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf Arab states.    
Iran stepped up its fight against smuggling fuel earlier this month when its coast guards seized a vessel for smuggling fuel in the Gulf and detained its 12 Filipino crew members.  
In July, Iran seized a British oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz for alleged marine violations, two weeks after British forces detained an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar accused of taking oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. 
Iran’s Adrian Darya 1, formerly Grace 1, was released last month. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Monday that the British-flagged Steno Impero oil tanker will be released soon.  
The latest reported ship seizure by Iran follows a series of incidents involving shipping in and near the Gulf after U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports took full effect in May. 
The incidents coincided with stepped up attacks by the Houthis on targets in Saudi Arabia.

Reuters
WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia but stressed he did not want to go to war, as the attacks sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict. 
Iran has rejected U.S. charges it was behind the strikes on Saturday that damaged the world’s biggest crude-processing plant and triggered the largest jump in crude prices in decades.   
Relations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear and ballistic programs. Washington also wants to pressure Tehran to end its support of regional proxy forces, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting Iran-backed Houthis for four years. 
The United States was still investigating if Iran was behind the Saudi strikes, Trump said, but “it’s certainly looking that way at this moment”. 
Trump, who has spent much of his presidency trying to disentangle the United States from wars he inherited, made clear, however, he was not going to rush into a new conflict on behalf of Saudi Arabia. 
“I’m somebody that would like not to have war,” Trump said.  
Several U.S. Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have blamed Tehran for the strikes. Pompeo and others will travel to Saudi Arabia soon, Trump said. 
A day after saying the United States was “locked and loaded” to respond to the incident, Trump said on Monday there was “no rush” to do so. 
“We have a lot of options but I’m not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this,” he said. 
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the strikes were carried out by “Yemeni people” retaliating for attacks by a Saudi-led military coalition in a war with the Houthi movement. 
“Yemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defense,” Rouhani told reporters during a visit to Ankara. 
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi called the allegations “unacceptable and entirely baseless.” 
The attacks cut 5% of world crude oil production. 
The attacks cut 5% of world crude oil production. 
Oil prices surged by as much as 19% after the incidents, the biggest intraday jump since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. Prices retreated from their peak after Trump said he would release U.S. emergency supplies and producers said there were enough stocks globally to make up for the shortfall. 
Japan said it will consider coordinated release of its oil reserves and other measures if needed to ensure sufficient supplies in the wake of the attacks. 
Crude prices were down around 1% in Asian trade on Tuesday.

Reuters
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s current account and fiscal deficit could take a hit if  oil prices continue to rise after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend, the central bank chief said on Monday.  
“We should allow a few more days to see how the situation plays out before taking a final view...depending on how long it persists it will have some impact on the current account deficit and further perhaps on the fiscal deficit if it lasts longer,” Governor Shaktikanta Das told the CNBC-TV18 news channel. 
Das said it was important to see whether alternative sources of supply come up and how soon the installations take to resume operation. 
U.S. officials blamed Iran for the attack, which damaged the world’s biggest crude oil processing plant and led to a 19% surge in oil prices. Iran denied blame and said it was ready for “full-fledged war”. 
A jump in oil prices is a negative for emerging markets such as India, which is the world’s third-biggest importer of oil. 
The country’s current account deficit in the March quarter narrowed on the back of the merchandise trade deficit contraction but a surge in crude prices could balloon the deficit and wreck havoc with the currency. 
The partially convertible rupee dropped nearly 1% on Monday to 71.60 per dollar versus its previous close of 70.92. 
India is also likely to miss its fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, despite receiving an additional dividend from the central bank, five government officials and advisers told Reuters earlier this month, as tax collections have sunk amid a sharp economic slowdown. 
Das said the monetary policy committee would continue to focus on growth with inflation expected to stay within the medium term target. 
Asia’s third largest economy expanded just 5.0% year on year in the June quarter, its weakest pace since 2013, far below the median forecast of 5.7%. 
“The numbers definitely look much worse. The number of 5% is a surprise. We are analysing why exactly it has happened,” Das told CNBC TV18. 
“Growth now is a matter of highest priority, especially with inflation remaining within 4%,” he added. 
The retail inflation rate rose to a 10-month high in August but stayed below the central bank’s 4% medium-term target. 
Analysts believe the slowdown could persist for two or three years while structural reforms are put in place. 
A Reuters poll conducted after the last monetary policy decision in August predicted the RBI would cut rates by another 25 basis points at its October review and then by 15 basis points early next year.

I’m glad that people are connecting with the kind of cinema that I’m doing and it only motivates me to be more brave with my film choices.” Known to offer some of the quirkiest themes in films, Ayushmann has once again done it with Dream Girl.

Further delving into details of how he is exceptionally happy with the way Dream Girl has turned out to be, Khurrana added, “For me, Dream Girl is a film that shows audiences what a clean family comedy should be. It is a solid entertainer that people can bring their entire family to the theatres. It is a paisa vasool movie in its truest sense. An actor like me always wants to entertain audiences in the best way possible and Dream Girl gave me the opportunity to make people laugh this time after making them ponder and spark a debate with Article 15 earlier this year.”
 
Dream Girl has enjoyed a very successful opening weekend as the film earned a whopping Rs 44.57 crore. On the same, Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted the statistics,  "Dream Girl runs riot at the BO... Packs a fantastic total, setting the BO on Day 2 and 3... Trends better than Raazi [Rs. 32.94 cr], Stree [Rs. 32.27 cr] and Uri [Rs. 35.73 cr]... Fri 10.05 cr, Sat 16.42 cr, Sun 18.10 cr. Total: Rs. 44.57 cr. India biz."

India.com
Patna: Four men, who were Monday booked for allegedly raping a former Muzaffarpur shelter home inmate, have been arrested.
“Four people arrested in connection with the alleged rape of a former Muzaffarpur shelter home inmate,” Jayant Kant, SP Bettiah told news agency ANI.
According to reports, the four accused had captured the shelter home survivor in a moving car where they allegedly raped her and later dumped her near her house.
Shockingly, two of the accused are brothers of the victim who was a part of an infamous NGO-run Muzaffarpur shelter home that made headlines last year.
Superintendent of Bettiah Police Jayant Kant told ANI on Monday, “We are taking further action based on whatever evidence we have collected so far. Four accused have been named, police teams have been formed and further action is being taken.”
“As per the medical report, no marks of external injury have been found on her body. FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) team is conducting their own examination,” he added.
Muzaffarpur shelter home case:
Over 30 girls were allegedly raped at the shelter home run by Brajesh Thakur, the chief of a state-funded NGO. The alleged sexual exploitation of the girls was first highlighted in an audit report submitted by TISS to the state’s social welfare department.
An FIR was lodged against 11 people, including Thakur, on May 31, 2018. The state government had on July 26, 2018 handed over the case to the CBI.
On February 7, 2019, the Supreme Court ordered authorities to transfer the case from Bihar to a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court in Saket District Court complex in Delhi, which would conclude the trial within six months by holding preferably day-to-day hearing.

Times Now
In a rather embarrassing incident, an Illinois lawmaker was pooped on by a pigeon while he was discussing the ongoing pigeon pooping problem at a local station in Chicago,
The unfortunate incident was caught on camera while state Rep. Jamie Andrade was giving an interview to CBS Chicago.
Andrade was discussing the pigeon dropping problem with the interviewer of the channel when the unthinkable happened. He became a victim himself.
The footage of the incident was shared by the interviewer, Lauren Victory, on Twitter.
She wrote: “Not to be crass but #IL lawmaker talking to me about feces, feathers & filth fell victim to culprit during our #MorningInsiders interview. Ew! @cbschicago caught it all on camera.
Watch it here:
 
OH CRAP!

Not to be crass but #IL lawmaker talking to me about feces, feathers & filth fell victim to culprit during our #MorningInsiders interview. Ew! @cbschicago caught it all on camera. At 6AM, hear more about Rep's years-long quest to fix bird issue at @cta #irvingpark stop pic.twitter.com/CntCAEGH19
 
“Did I just get – I did, didn’t I? I’ll just have to go clean up. That’s what happens to my constituents. They get shit on all time,” Andrade can be heard saying in the interview footage that has now gone viral.
The channel reported pigeons have become a menace at the Irvine Park Blue Line station as their droppings and feathers cover the commuters path on a daily basis.
Andrade said that the authorities are trying their best to fix the problem. The commuters, however, are not happy with the progress.
“They washed it as result of the first news story, and then nothing at all happened. There were no washings in between then and a month later when I complained again on social media,” rider Derek Barthel told CBS Chicago.
The underpass near the blue line station is where the pigeons hang out. It is not part of the station and comes under the jurisdiction of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The sidewalk just below it serves as the pigeon’s dropping area.
Andrade said that he needs to go back to the drawing board in order to find a solution to the problem.
 “Now I have to come up with new money,” he said.

Times Now
Washington DC: Actor-model Cara Delevingne, who made it to the top of the entrainment industry was once told by media mogul Harvey Weinstein that she'd "never make it" in Hollywood because of her sexuality. "In the beginning, I don't think it helped. One of the first things Harvey Weinstein ever said to me was, 'You will never make it in this industry as a gay woman - get a beard," she told Net-a-Porter of being out, reported Fox News.
The Suicide Squad actor said Weinstein told her this "a long time before" he attempted sexual advances towards her, which she initially alleged in a social media post in the year 2017.
The 27-year-old model-actor who has always been open about her sexuality said when she started her career as an actor, Weinstein called her "asking if I had slept with any of the women I was seen out with, in the media."
She described her telephonic conversation with him as "very odd and uncomfortable," and said that before she disconnected the call, Weinstein "said to me that if I was gay or decided to be with a woman especially in public, I would never get the role of a straight woman or make it as an actress in Hollywood." reported Fox News.
In the interview published last week, according to the actor the whole situation with Weinstein, where he allegedly attempted to make her kiss a woman and also tried to kiss Delevingne himself -- was "insane."

BGR
Apple is reportedly investing $1 billion to expand local manufacturing of iPhones in India. The move is seen as the way to look beyond China for assembly of iPhone. It is being described as part of Apple‘s plan to export ‘Made in India’ iPhones across the world. The details arrive amidst the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The iPhone maker is expected to become a victim soon forcing it to increase the price of iPhone around the world.
Earlier, reports claimed that Apple is looking to expand production to Vietnam and India to thwart effects of trade war. Now, an unofficial source has told the Times of India that the Cupertino, California-based company is investing $1 billion through its partners. “They have said the production will be used for meeting the demand for its products across global markets.” Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn is said to be the investment partner in Apple’s push to assemble iPhone in the country.

Foxconn will use its facility in Chennai to manufacture products for Apple’s global markets. Alongside Foxconn, the report notes that other component suppliers will also be making investments in the country for local push. Apple has been assembling iPhone locally in India in partnership with Wistron in Bengaluru. But it is now tapping into Foxconn to further expand local manufacturing in the country. The report notes that ‘testing is underway’ for the products made in India and iPhone maker is seeking clarity on export incentives.
After pushing for Make in India, the government is now encouraging companies to make in India and export to the world. Ravi Shankar Prasad, the IT and electronics minister, has also asked the iPhone maker to expand its manufacturing base in the country. “Apple has started manufacturing iPhones in India… making components and are exporting as well… Apple is on board as far as India’s success story is concerned,” Prasad said.

The expansion of local manufacturing in India will help the company gain market share in the premium segment. It might be able to price iPhones aggressively to take on Samsung and OnePlus‘ flagship smartphones. The increased local production is also seen to help Apple meet the 30 percent local sourcing norms required to open retail stores in the country. The Tim Cook-led company is said to be planning to open three brick-and-mortar stores in India and establish online sales. It has reportedly conveyed the plans to the government and is looking at Mumbai and Delhi for first retail stores.

Facebook-owned Instagram has started rolling out a new feature called Instagram Music on all platforms. The functionality helps users tag song lyrics and snippets to their Instagram stories. The feature was previously rolled out in the US in June 2018, but has made its way to India only now.
Instagram Music can be found in the stickers drawer.
To use the new feature, update your Instagram app to the latest version (v110.0.0.16.119). You can check this in the app's description in the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store. Next open the app, swipe right and a create a new story by clicking a picture or tapping on 'Create' to make a new text story.
Once you're done with that, you're required to swipe up or tap on the sticker icon. You will then find a new icon that reads 'Music'.
Tapping on this will let you choose a song of your choice that you can link to your story.
You can then select the segment of the song you wish to use in your story using a slider. It also lets you change the font style, size and colour of the lyrics.
Once you're satisfied with you selection, you can tap on 'Done' on the top right corner. You can then resize the lyrics and place them in area of your choice to suit the aesthetics of your story.
The feature is only available on Instagram stories, not posts.
The song library features a plethora of Indian songs as well as some popular international numbers.
The feature is not just restricted to Instagram—it is also available on Facebook. To check it out, create a new post with an image or video on Facebook. You can then tap on 'Edit' icon hovering on the bottom left corner of the media you have chosen. Then tap on stickers and there you should find an icon called 'Music'. This works the same way as Instagram Music.
Facebook, in March this year, announced a partnership with Indian labels including T-Series Music, Zee Music Company and Yash Raj Films. Facebook at the time promised its users that it would let them include their favourite music in videos, messages, posts, stories and other creative content. The year-long wait for the arrival of Instagram Music in India seems to be due to this reason.

Engadget
Tesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't believe his use of the term of "pedo guy" was an actual accusation of pedophilia. Lawyers for Musk in a court filing today argued that the missive, which Musk directed at a British diver last year and has made the South African billionaire the target of a defamation lawsuit, is actually a common insult from his childhood.
"By referring to Mr. Unsworth as 'pedo guy,' I did not intend to convey any facts or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia," Musk said in a court filing Monday. "Pedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up. It is synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of pedophilia." Musk followed up his original tweet with another tweet that read, "bet you a signed dollar it's true."
Shortly after he sent his tweets, Musk paid a private investigator $50,000 to investigate the British diver in question, Vernon Unsworth. The investigator claimed to unearth a series of salacious details about Unsworth's life, including telling Musk that he was a regular at Pattaya Beach -- a region in Thailand known for sex trafficking -- and married his wife when she was a teenager. Unsworth's 40-year old wife has since disputed the claims, saying that the couple has been married for seven years.
Musk's lawyers are arguing that that there is no evidence to prove that he genuinely believed Unsworth to be a pedophile. "There is no evidence that Mr Musk intended or believed that his July 15 tweets, that Mr Unsworth was 'sus' or 'pedo guy', would be interpreted as fact," the filing said. "To the contrary, the evidence is that Mr Musk believed and intended his statements to be read as what they were: bare insults."
The complaint was filed in the US District Court of the Central District of California. The first hearing will be on October 28th and the trial will occur on December 2nd; both in Los Angeles. Musk last year asked the judge to toss out the lawsuit, labeling it a "schoolyard spat".

Six months after concluding $300 million investment in Ola, automotive majors Hyundai and Kia Motors are finalising an agreement to acquire a stake in Ola Electric Mobility.
Ola had already revealed that the strategic investments by Hyundai and Kia would help it to develop fleet and mobility solutions, electric vehicles and infrastructure. 
Apart from acquiring stake in Ola’s parent ANI Technologies, the automotive majors will also receive a certain minority equity stake in the electric mobility arm.
According to a filing by Competition Commission of India, the deal will be done as an interconnected transaction to the proposed ANI investment.
The details of the transaction could not be ascertained.
For the unaware, even the minority stake in Ola Electric, will be valued in a million dollars. Two months ago, it became a Unicorn following the investment by Softbank.
Besides, Ola Electric has on-boarded some prominent institutional investors such as Tiger Global and Matrix Partners and individual investor Ratan Tata.
Till date, the company has raised over $300 million, and it is in talks to raise fresh funds from several investors including chairman of Hero MotoCorp, Pawan Munjal.
The development comes on the heels of Hyundai’s announcement to begin supplies of ‘affordable’ and ‘mass market’ range of electric vehicles to Ola from 2022-23.
Of late, Ola Electric had restructured the team to solely focus on electric and roll out the first set of EVs and the associated infrastructure within the set deadline.  
The ride-hailing firm has also set up an Advanced Technology Center in the USA to find innovative electric mobility solutions. Led by Anand Shah, Ola Electric manufactures and runs e-vehicles with recharging solutions.

OYO’s founder Ritesh Agarwal ambitious $1.5 billion stock buyback plan has got a green signal from the Competition Commission of India (CCI).
The approval will allow OYO’s founder to facilitate a transaction through freshly formed Cayman-based RA Hospitality Holdings, explicitly devised to facilitate this primary and secondary transaction on behalf of Agarwal.
The transaction would take the valuation of OYO to $10 billion, whereas Agarwal current 9% stake would increase to over 30%.
“The company will get an additional primary infusion of approximately $1.5 billion to support our mission,” an ET report quoted Agarwal as saying after getting the approval.
He further added that the transaction would help OYO maintaining its leadership position in India and other overseas markets including Southeast Asai, Middle East, US and Europe.
The stock buyback plan will also give the biggest cashout to venture funds Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital.
Lightspeed, which holds around 13% stake (for $20 million investment) in OYO, is set to make around $1 billion from the sale of its half stake. Whereas Sequoia Capital, which has around 10% stake (for $27 million investment), is slated to make about $500 million from the partial stake sale.
Earlier in July, Entrackr had reported that three Japan-based banks- Nomura, Mizuho, and one unidentified bank, will fund Ritesh Agarwal’s $2 billion loans, out of which $1.5 billion will be used for buyback of Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Lightspeed’s shares and $500 million for primary investment purposes.
Nomura and Mizuho are the principal lenders in this deal.
The repayment is expected in three years when OYO plans to hit IPO. The hotel chain expects its valuation to go up to $18 billion by then. This would take Agarwal’s stake worth to $4.8 billion, through which he plans to repay the loan with interest.

The News Minute
"I told them not to rescue me. There's no point in staying alive. At 33 years, my life is over," Madhulata tells her visitors at the Rajahmundry Government General Hospital, pausing to weep in between sentences. Madhulata had just been taken to the mortuary to see the body of her 12-year-old daughter Hasini, who lost her life in the Godavari boat tragedy on Sunday. Her cries ring across the hospital room, as she weeps for her child.
Madhulata's husband, Subramanyam, is one of the 24 people still missing, most of whom are presumed to be dead. A short, fun family holiday to Bhadrachalam has now ended in Madhulata losing her only child, and possibly her husband, to the violent waters of the Godavari.
At the hospital are 17 other survivors of the accident, who were brought here from Devipatnam around midnight on Sunday. Earlier in the day, they had all been on a boat called the Royal Vashishta, which had capsized while carrying 61 people, near Kachuluru village of Devipatnam mandal in East Godavari district.
Less than 24 hours have passed since the disaster. Most of the survivors are steeped in trauma – of having nearly lost their lives, of identifying the bodies while fearing the worst. 

A fun holiday gone horribly wrong
“My colleagues and I had been planning the trip for a while. Now I have lost two of my close friends. I don't know when this feeling of depression will stop," says Jyoti Babu, a carpenter in his 20s, who had gone on the boat ride with four of his friends who all work in carpentry or construction.
The boat was filled with similar groups of friends and family, who were looking to have a good time on the picturesque boat ride in the Godavari through the Papikondalu (Papi hills) to Bhadrachalam.
According to the survivors, the boat left from the Gandi Pochamma temple sometime after 11 am. Within a few minutes, they were instructed by the boat crew to put on their life jackets, as they were approaching a police station. "They didn't tell us how to wear them, how to tighten the belt properly etc. The police then did a check, took photos and let the boat go ahead," says Jyoti Babu. Survivors say that most of them soon removed their jackets and placed them under their chairs, unable to bear the humidity, but the crew never took the life jackets seriously. "Even the few people wearing it had just slipped them on loosely," Jyoti Babu says.
As passengers moved to the top deck, where a performance area and a sun shelter had been set up, the boat shook once even in the beginning of the journey, Jyoti Babu claims, but the crew kept assuring passengers that the driver would be careful, in spite of overloading. "The entertainment staff explicitly said that we were approaching waters of dangerous depth, but the driver would be careful," he says.
The entertainment staff were singing and dancing to film songs in the performance area, with some passengers joining in, says Prabhakar, a 47-year-old railways employee from Kazipet in Warangal, who had been planning the trip with his group of friends for months.
"As we neared Kachuluru, they just told us to go back to our seats and not to move, as it was a dangerous area. Our life jackets were still under our chairs," Prabhakar says, recalling the exact moment of the accident. "The boat started to tilt to our side. Since the chairs were not fixed to the deck floor, the chair from the other end started tumbling down. Then the people also began to fall on us," he says. He expected this to be a small tremor, like earlier, and waited for the boat to come back to its position. "Slowly, water started to enter through the railing and I realised this was really happening, the boat was capsizing," he recalls.
Madhulata also recalls how everything happened so quickly, there was no time to react  "It took less than a minute for the boat to topple. Within the next two minutes, most of the people had drowned," she says.

Rescue for a fortunate few 
As the boat started to drown, many passengers tried to hold on to the railing, as the unused orange life jackets began to float all around them. Some of them, like Prabhakar and Jyoti Babu, tried to throw the life jackets to others around them, so they could hold on to them and try to stay afloat.
"The boat was being pulled into a whirlpool. If we stayed there, even the life jacket would have been of no help, so I swam away from the whirlpool, holding onto the jacket," Jyoti Babu says.
He says they were lucky that the accident happened at a place where they were visible to the fishermen from Tutukunta, who instantly arrived in their fishing boats to rescue people who had tried to swim to safety. "They did multiple trips to try and rescue as many people as they could, almost everyone who has survived owes their life to the fishing community there," says Prabhakar.
Prabhakar's friend Suresh, who tried to save another friend Avinash, held onto him until the fishing boat arrived. But only after hauling his friend on to the boat, Suresh realised that his friend had already breathed his last.
The fishermen, who knew the river in those parts inside out, told the survivors that the driver must have been really inexperienced to have taken the boat so close to the whirlpool. "They told us that the location of the countercurrent is commonly known, and boats are usually directed along the edge of the river to avoid going too close to the vortex,” Jyoti Babu says.
Prabhakar says the survivors reached Tutukunta around 1.40 pm, which means the accident might have occurred just a few minutes earlier, around 1.15 pm. About a half hour later, an Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) mobile medical boat arrived at Tutukunta, having spotted the trail of floating life jackets. The survivor group was then taken to a medical camp in Rampachodavaram, where they were provided first aid, before being moved to the Rajahmundry GGH.

The trauma
Sixteen men and two women survivors were brought to the Rajahmundry GGH. Most of them do not have any visible injuries, except a couple of people who've had minor fractures. One man, who was travelling with his wife, friend and friend's wife, and is the lone survivor of his group as of now, has been sent to the ICU. But the trauma haunting the survivors almost has a physical form of its own. While some people cope with tears, some are frozen in a state of numbness even as they recount their stories to visiting politicians and reporters.
Prabhakar, who was the only survivor in the ward who could speak without visible emotional scars, says that he had gotten used to speaking to the media since yesterday, as that was the only way he could think of communicating to his family that he was safe, having lost his phone in the accident and being unable to recall any phone numbers.
There is anger and resentment among the survivors that they're not sure whom to direct to: the allegedly inexperienced boat driver, the government departments who failed to stop the unlicensed boat, or the police for not ensuring implementation of safety measures.
The state government has announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh for families of those who've died in the accident. But as of now, there seems to be no cure in sight for the psychological impact that the incident has had on survivors.

Office bearers, key functionaries and members of NGOs, receiving foreign funds, will have to declare before the government that they were not prosecuted or convicted for converting anyone from one faith to another, the Home Ministry said on Monday. In a notification, the ministry announced the changes in the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011, which includes that individuals receiving personal gift valued up to Rs 1 lakh need not inform the government about it anymore. It has been made mandatory for every key member of the NGO “office bearers and key functionaries and members” to certify that they have not been “prosecuted or convicted” for “conversion” from one faith to another and for creating “communal tension and disharmony”, according to the notification.
Earlier, as per the FCRA 2010, only the applicants such as directors who were seeking permission to receive foreign contribution were required to make such a declaration. In addition, every member of an NGO must also now, under oath, through an affidavit, certify that they have never been involved in “diverting” foreign funds or propagating “sedition” or “advocating violent means”. This declaration, too, needs to be given to all members of an NGO.
Earlier, this declaration was to be only given by the applicant of an NGO. Individuals receiving personal gift valued up to Rs 1 lakh need not inform the government about it anymore, the Home Ministry said on Monday as it amended the FCRA. Earlier, the threshold value was Rs 25,000, as per the market value of the gift item in India.
The Centre amended the rules governing the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2011, and notified this change alongside some other modifications. In case of emergent medical aid needed during a visit abroad, the acceptance of foreign hospitality has to be intimated to the government within a month of such receipt, according to the amended rules. The intimation should contain full details including the source, approximate value in Indian rupees and the purpose for which and the manner in which it was utilised. Earlier, the intimation was required to be given within two months.
The Modi government has over the past five years tightened rules and procedures to receive and utilise foreign contribution. Permission to receive foreign contribution has been taken away from nearly 18,000 NGOs which were found to be violating the various clauses of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Monday borrowed the words of British singer Elton John, "performers are all show-offs", to describe US President Donald Trump joining Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Howdy, Modi!" mega diaspora event in the United States.
He took to Twitter to take a swipe at the prime minister over his event scheduled to be held at Houston, Texas in the US on September 22.
"I think performers are all show-offs anyway. Unless you show off, you're not going to get noticed - Elton John," Singhvi wrote on the microblogging website while talking about "Howdy, Modi!".
At the All India Congress Committee (AICC) briefing, senior party leader Rajiv Shukla said it was a good thing that a US President would attend an event of the Indian prime minister.
"It is a good thing. Donald Trump's election is also approaching. There is a big Indian population in the United States," he said.
Trump will join Modi at the mega "Howdy, Modi!" diaspora event in Houston on Sunday to bolster the Indo-US strategic ties, according to a White House announcement that was hailed by the prime minister on Monday as a "special gesture" signifying the "special friendship" between the two countries.
Emphasising the new bonhomie in the India-US ties under the Trump administration, this would be the first time in recent history that the leaders of the two largest democracies would be addressing a joint rally anywhere in the world.

More than 50,000 Indian-Americans from across the US have registered for the September 22 "Howdy, Modi! Shared Dreams, Bright Futures" event to be held at the sprawling NRG Stadium in Houston.
In a statement on Sunday, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said, "It (Modi-Trump joint rally) will be a great opportunity to emphasise the strong ties between the people of the US and India, to reaffirm the strategic partnership between the world's oldest and largest democracies, and to discuss ways to deepen their energy and trade relationship."
Hours after the White House announcement, Modi, in a series of tweets, said he looked forward to joining the Indian community in welcoming Trump at the event.
"A special gesture by @POTUS, signifying the special friendship between India and USA... highlights the strength of the relationship and recognition of the contribution of the Indian community to American society and economy," the prime minister said in one of the tweets.
This will also be the first time that an American president will address thousands of Indian-Americans at one place in the US.

Times Now
Like any other aspiring actress, Hazel Keech too had entered Bollywood keeping her hopes high. However, despite getting to make a stellar debut with a rather big film, Bodyguard (2011) opposite Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan, her career didn't lead her any further. Except for a few item numbers, Hazel didn't appear in any film post Bodyguard and the reason is not because she wasn't offered any but because she felt she was being typecast as an actress.
In her latest interview with Hindustan Times, Hazel, who is now happily married to cricketer Yuvraj Singh, spoke at length about why her acting career was shortlived and how she felt frustrated after on point in time. "For me, it was frustrating coming to Bollywood, growing up in a very Hindu-traditional Indian household with a British father and trying to convince people that I am Indian after being judged by my name and accent", confessed the actress further stating that thankfully things are changing todayfor the good as she added, "In my years in India, I have seen Bollywood change from having certain requirements like knowing classical dance and speaking Hindi to having none of those matter anymore. Women don't even need to be Indian anymore. Today we have leading actresses from different nationalities as well as from India". 



Hazel also mentioned that she got similar roles offered after Bodyguard and that same was the case even when she tried doing item numbers. "As an actor, I want to do projects that interest me in terms of the story and role. When I commit to anything, I give it my 100 percent time and energy so I don't compromise on the work I do", she said in the same interview.
After a gap of 8 years, Hazel is now returning to acting with Aamir Khan's daughter Ira Khan's debut directorial play, Euripide's Medea. Talking about working with Ira, Hazel said, "She is young and has seen a lot for her age. She understands the complexities of the characters and their dynamics. It's impressive to see her so sure of herself and what she wants."

Reuters
(Reuters) - Roger Federer will not be losing any sleep over whether rival Rafa Nadal can match his men’s record 20 Grand Slam singles titles, according to his long-term coach Severin Luthi. 
The 38-year-old Swiss began the year three ahead of second-placed Nadal’s haul but the Spaniard claimed a 12th French Open title this year followed up by winning the U.S. Open this month. 
It has re-energised the GOAT (greatest of all time) debate with Nadal, who has 19 slams, looking back to his best after injury concerns earlier this year. 
Never in his career has Nadal been only one Grand Slam title behind Federer, who squandered two match points against Novak Djokovic in this year’s Wimbledon final. 
“No, I don’t think he stresses (about Nadal catching him up),” Swiss Luthi, who has toured with Federer since 2007, told Reuters in an interview. 
“He focuses on himself. He has a lot of respect for Rafa and knows what it takes to win that many titles. 
“I don’t see him in any way stressed. He won’t be completely destroyed if Rafa makes the 20.” 
Luthi said fans of tennis should savour watching the two greats, rather than obsess about who is superior. 
“It’s good for the fans. Especially the ones who thought it was all over when Roger had 16 or 17 and Rafa had 14.” 
Luthi is captain of the Swiss Davis Cup team that has had to make do without Federer and three-times Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka for the past four years. 
They were both absent again when Switzerland lost to Slovakia in a Group I clash in Bratislava, meaning there is no chance Switzerland could play in the revamped Davis Cup Finals until 2021 at the earliest. 
Federer’s decision not top play Davis Cup could effect his eligibility for the Tokyo Olympics, although Luthi said no final decision had been made on whether he will play in Tokyo. 
“It’s possible but it’s not a goal,” Luthi said. “He will leave it open a little bit. I don’t know how it works with (Olympic) wildcards. They used to give them to the small countries, but I think if he said he wanted to play....” 
Federer and Nadal, whose rivalry has always been respectful, will join forces this week at the Laver Cup in Geneva when Europe take on the Rest of the World.

Cricket Country
Steve Smith made a sensational return to Test cricket and scored 774 runs across seven innings as Australia retained the urn even as the series ended in a 2-2 draw, with England winning the fifth and final Test at the Oval on Sunday.
Smith, who was suspended in the wake of ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year, scored as many as three hundreds, including a double, and two fifties.
The Australian missed the third Test after being hit by a Jofra Archer bouncer in the first innings of the second Test.

But he continued from where he had left and scored 293 runs on return – 211 and 82 runs in the first and second innings respectively in the fourth Test – helping Australia retain the urn on the English soil for the first time since 2001.
The former Australian captain, despite scoring a chunk of runs was severely booed across venues since Australia set foot in England ahead of the World Cup 2019. However, as he walked back to the dressing room after being dismissed for 23 in the final innings of Ashes 2019, the crowd appreciated the Australian. Smith admitted that it meant a lot to him.
“It meant a lot to have that reception from the crowd today. It’s been an amazing couple of months with the World Cup and the Ashes, the cricket has been spectacular,” said Smith.

“The series has ebbed and flowed. I’ve loved every minute and I’m really proud of how I’ve been able to perform for Australia and to bring the urn home,” continued Smith.
“You always want to get better as a player. You need to keep working hard and continue doing what helps your team win games,” added Smith, who won the Compton–Miller Medal for the second consecutive Ashes series.
While Matthew Wade scored a fighting ton, England managed to seal a convincing win in the final Test of the Ashes 2019, with a day to spare.
“You have always got to believe. The middle of the wicket really played well. Wade showed that if you hang in there you could score. But not enough people hung in there with him,” said Smith.
The Australian, who shared the dressing room with Archer while playing for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL), appreciated the England pacer, saying he has a bright future.
“I saw Jofra last year at the IPL and realized he is a very special talent. He has got a very bright future,” concluded Smith.

India are in the middle of a team-building process that started off following their disappointing outing in the ICC World Cup in May-July. The Men in Blue are now looking forward to the T20 World Cup in Australia later in 2020 and with a big pool of players to choose from, the captain has drawn the lines. Skipper Virat Kohli has said the new players who would be picked have four to five opportunities to prove their worth.
Speaking ahead of his team’s first T20I against South Africa in Dharamsala that got washed out on Sunday, Kohli said the same had applied even for himself when he started. The 30-year-old made his India debut in 2008 and has seen a phenomenal run with over 20k runs scored across three formats with 68 international hundreds.

“We are very clear. It is not that anyone will get 30 chances. Even when I came in the team, I didn’t think I will get 15-20 games and I knew I will mostly get chances in three to five games and I have to prove myself. One will get suppose five chances and he will have to prove himself. That is the level we are playing at. As the team management has that mindset, the individual should also have the same,” Kohli was heard saying while speaking during an interaction on bcci.tv.
The 2007 world champions in T20Is will be playing around 30 T20Is before the T20 World Cup. About the number of games that each player would get, Kohli said the management would figure it out. “It is a delicate balance to strike but as we have 30 games before it (World Cup), so we have to figure out how much time each individual gets,” the ace batsman added.
When being asked whether the T20I series against the Proteas marks the beginning of India’s preparation for the T20 World Cup next year, Kohli said along with it, the ongoing ICC World Test Championship is also being kept under consideration.
“We feel both the T20Is and the Test championship are in our focus as both of them are milestones and that is why youngsters are being pushed in from time to time as it is important to settle the team combination because we have to figure out the guys who will take the team forward,” Kohli stated.
India are currently on top of the points table in the World Test Championship with 120 points picked from the recent two-Test series against the West Indies. They will next take on South Africa in a three-game series at home and Kohli and Co. will look to maintain the lead.

TechCrunch
YouTube  commenters will now have their channel loyalty — or their tendency to troll — exposed, thanks to a new feature called profile cards, now in testing. Recently announced by way of YouTube’s Creator Insider channel, where the company shares updates and changes with its creator community, these new profile cards would appear whenever you clicked on a commenter’s name, and would list all their other recent comments on the channel.
Currently, if you click on a commenter’s name, you’re redirected to their channel page on YouTube.
But that doesn’t allow the video creator or other commenters to learn much about the person behind a given comment, in many cases, as not everyone publishes to YouTube. The commenter’s channel could be sparse, out of date or completely unrelated to the topic at hand.
With the new profile cards, however, you’ll instead be able to see all the recent comments left on the channel over the past 12 months. However, it won’t show their comments left on other channels at this time. In other words, it’s not a full user profile, similar to what you would find on other message board sites like Reddit, where a complete comment history is available for each user.
“It will help you get a sense of what this person is writing,” explains YouTube Director of Product Management Tom Leung, in the annoucement published in the past week. “We hope that it will strengthen connections with others in the YouTube community and will help creators recognize some of their best commenters,” he added.

Though not mentioned, the new feature also could help creators recognize some of their worst commenters, as well — meaning, those who only show up to troll, derail discussions or otherwise cause problems.
Being able to see a history of someone’s comments would allow a video creator or moderator to make a more informed decision about whether future comments from the same user should be hidden or, conversely, if the user is trustworthy enough to earn a spot on the “approved users” list so their comments get published automatically.
The new profile card also will include a link to the commenter’s YouTube channel, but it doesn’t redirect you there as before. YouTube didn’t say how broadly the experiment is being rolled out for testing’s sake, but it was well-received by the community members reacting to the announcement at the time.
The test is one of several experiments running on YouTube at present. Another will allow video creators to display a personalized message to help attract new subscribers, the video also noted.

Entrackr
Weeding out the paper from conventional khata-bahi (bookkeeping) appears to be a segment that is drawing unprecedented interest from venture capitalists.
Top tier VCs such as Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed and hedge fund Tiger Global have already picked up their bets in the segment, which did not exist a year ago. We have never seen such confidence for institutional investors in a B2B segment so early.
While the first two investors chose OKCredit in the segment, Sequoia put a bet on its Surge’s accelerator portfolio – KhataBook.
DST Partners Fund, Ribbit Capital along with 20 top angels were reportedly investing $20 million Series A round in KhataBook. According to three Entrackr sources, the round has already been executed. Now, it’s raising a new round in what appears to be a Series B from Tencent and GGV Capital.
“It’s in advanced discussion to raise $80-85 million fresh financing round from Tencent and GGV Capital,” said two sources aware with the details of the deal on condition of anonymity. 
The investment from the Chinese conglomerate in KhataBook is coming at a time when Tiger Global and Lightspeed Venture Capital ramped their stakes in its rival OKCredit by investing over $60 million. 
Entrackr had exclusively reported the deal on Friday. 
“While Tencent will be putting about $70-75 million, the remaining $5-10 million will come from GGV,” added sources. According to them, the contours of the deal has been finalised, and it will be announced soon. 
This is the first pure-play B2B investment for Tencent in India.
KhataBook is a cash management tool, specially designed for tier II, tier III and beyond, used by 500 different types of businesses. Recently, it claimed 12X merchant onboarding growth between March to July this year. 
According to KhataBook’s founder and CEO, Ravish Naresh, the company had crossed 20,000 crore entries in August. Further, it claims that Shopkeepers across 3,000 Indian cities are using KhataBook along with it being used in Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.
So far, Tencent invested in seven firms including five Unicorns – BYJU’s, Dream11, Hike, Swiggy and Ola. It also put money in Flipkart (now exited) and OTA – ibibo (now part of MMT) and TIL-hatched music streaming app Gaana. 
On the other hand, KhataBook would be the second bet for GGV capital in Indian B2B space. Last month, GGV invested $15 million in Udaan. 
Entrackr had exclusively reported its participation in $300 million closure by B2B marketplace in ongoing Series D round. The VC firm with 11 Unicorns in its global portfolio such as Airbnb, Bytedance, Xiaomi, Slack and Wish also invested in Tala. 
Tala generates credit profile to enable collateral-free loans to consumers. It announced Indian launch along with its Series D round.
KhataBook competes directly with OkCredit and indirectly with Vypaar.
Queries sent to Tencent and KhataBook on late Monday didn’t elicit any immediate responses. We will update the post as and when they respond. GGV Capital couldn’t be contacted immediately.
Though there has been an unprecedented interest of VCs in the nascent bookkeeping space, none of the companies has revealed their monetisation plans. It’s no secret that they would eventually target lending in one form or another to make money. 
Since there are dozens of fintech companies in B2B and B2C segments eyeing to make money via lending, the bigger question: who all survive until monetisation phase?

Daily Mail
A 10-year-old Texas girl is fighting for her life in hospital after contracting a rare brain-eating parasite while swimming in the Brazos River over Labor Day. 
Lily Avant was placed in a medically induced coma after her condition deteriorated following complaints of a headache and fever on September 8. 
The youngster is understood to have contracted the parasite known as Naegleria fowleri after swimming in the waters behind her home in Whitney, and has now been in Fort Worth hospital for several days. 
Her father John Crawson told Today: 'We hope we got to her in time. She is a fighter. She is stronger than anybody I know.'
Little Lily's family held a vigil on Friday evening, praying for her to be the fifth survivor of the deadly infection.
The amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, causes a brain infection that leads to the destruction of tissue. In its early stages, symptoms may be similar to bacterial meningitis.
The organism does not cause illness if swallowed, but can be deadly if forced through the nose.

Relative Wendy Scott told KXAS: 'The water is in Lily's backyard. She has swum in there day in, day out. The day she was in there, we had 40 people in there with her.
'They got it checked out. There were several viruses going around the school. It was assumed it's a virus because the symptoms are exactly the same, so she was sent home.
'She was brought into the emergency room on Tuesday when she woke up unresponsive. She was eyes open, she was there, but she wasn't speaking. Nothing.
'We thought if the water is flowing, it's safe, but that's clearly not the case.'
Scott added Saturday: 'We're at the point where the doctors have exhausted their resources. Lily is still fighting, she's still saying strong. 
'We're just waiting for God to step in and perform a miracle. She is in stable condition, she is still in the ICU at this time, and that's basically where we're at. We just need lots of prayers.'

'The water is in Lily's backyard. She has swum in there day in, day out', a relative said 
The infection is very rare with the single-celled organism commonly found in warm freshwater, such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs, as well as in soil. 'Lily is still fighting, she's still saying strong', relatives have said 
A spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services said: 'We average less than one per year in Texas. However, it is extremely serious and almost always fatal. Since it's so rare, we don't know why a few people get sick while millions who swim in natural bodies of water don't.' 
Lily's mum Laci wrote on Facebook: 'I don't have the words to tell you all how much we appreciate every single one of you.
'We thank you all for every single thing that everyone has been doing to help us fight this fight.
'We are truly blessed to have so many people fighting along with us for our baby girl.'
Naegleria fowleri is commonly referred to as the 'brain-eating amoeba' as it can cause a rare and devastating infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).
The infection is very rare with the single-celled organism commonly found in warm freshwater, such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs, as well as in soil.
It usually infects people when contaminated water enters the body through the nose. Once the amoeba enters the nose, it travels to the brain where it causes PAM, which is usually fatal.
Infection typically occurs when people go swimming or diving in warm freshwater places, like lakes and rivers.
In very rare instances, Naegleria infections may also occur when contaminated water from other sources (such as inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or heated and contaminated tap water) enters the nose.
You cannot get infected from swallowing water contaminated with Naegleria.

The student who has levelled rape charges against Swami Chinmayanand threatened self-immolation on Wednesday if he is not arrested even as the BJP leader was admitted to a local hospital complaining of uneasiness.
"Even two days after I recorded my statement before a magistrate, Chinmayanand has not been arrested. If the government is waiting for me to die, I will sprinkle kerosene on my body and immolate myself," the student told reporters in Shahjahanpur.
The special investigation team probing her allegations had on Monday taken the woman before Judicial Magistrate Geetika Singh to record her statement.

When asked about the progress in the SIT probe led by him, Inspector General-rank IPS officer Naveen Arora said it has to complete the investigation by September 23 and submit a report in the Allahabad High Court.
He said all angles in the case are being probed, and a mobile phone and a pen drive sent for forensic examination.

The woman's father claimed that the SIT, set up on the orders of the Supreme Court, has not told him why an FIR has not been registered against Chinmayanand following the rape complaint filed by her.
"We will consult our lawyers on this," he said.
Police had earlier registered a case of abduction and criminal intimidation on a complaint initially lodged by the father.
Chinmayanand, 72, was admitted at a state-run hospital on Wednesday following medical advice.
"After his condition became bad, he was shifted to the medical college hospital and admitted in ward number 8," Chief Medical Superintendent Dr M P Gangwar said.

TechCrunch
Facebook  on Monday announced a number of updates aimed at video creators and publishers, during a session at the International Broadcasting Convention (IBC) taking place in Amsterdam. The updates involve changes to live video broadcasting, Facebook’s Watch Party and Creator Studio, and they include enhancements to tools, expanded feature sets and improved analytics, among other things.
The highlights include better ways to prep for and simulcast live broadcasts, ways to take better advantage of Watch Party events, new metrics to track video performance and a much-anticipated option to schedule Instagram/IGTV  content for up to six months in advance.
Live video

In terms of live video, Facebook says it listened to feedback from those who have been broadcasting live on its platform, and is now rolling out several highly requested features to Facebook Pages (not Profiles.) The changes are an attempt to better accommodate professional broadcasters who want to use Facebook’s live broadcasting capabilities instead of or in addition to other platforms, like YouTube.
Through the Live API, publishers can now use a “rehearsal” feature to broadcast live only to Page admins and editors in order to test new production setups, interactive features and show formats before going live to a full audience. QVC has tested this feature, as they broadcast live on Facebook for hundreds of hours per month, and have wanted to try out new workflows and formats.
Publishers will also be able to trim the beginning and end of a live video, and can live broadcast for as long as eight hours — double the previous limit of four hours.
This latter capability has already been used by NASA, which broadcast an eight-hour spacewalk, for example, and it also leaves room for broadcasting things like live sports, news events and Twitch-like gaming broadcasts.
Most notably, perhaps, is that the company realizes live broadcasters need to serve their audiences outside of Facebook. Now, publishers will be able to use apps that let them stream to more than one streaming service at once, by simulcasting via the Live API.
Live video recently rolled out to Facebook Lite, as well, the company also noted.

Watch Party
Facebook additionally announced a few new updates for its co-watching feature, Watch Party, which include the ability for Pages to schedule a party in advance to build anticipation, support for “replays” that will let others enjoy the video after airing, the ability to tag business partners in branded content and new analytics.
As for the latter, two new metrics are being added to Creator Studio: Minutes Viewed and Unique 60s Viewers (total number of unique users that watched at least 60 seconds in a Watch Party). These complement existing metrics like reach and engagement.
The Live Commenting feature, which allows a host to go live in a Watch Party to share their own commentary, is also now globally available.
Creator Studio
And wrapping all this up is an update to Creator Studio, which is what publishers use to post, manage, monetize and measure their content across both Facebook and Instagram.

The dashboard will soon add a new visualization layer in Loyalty Insights to help creators see which videos loyal fans want to see by measuring which videos drive return viewers.
A new Distribution metric will score each video’s performance based on the Page’s historic average on a range of metrics, including: 1 Minute Views, Average Minutes Watched and Retention. This feature, rolling out in the next few months, will offer an easy-to-read snapshot of a video’s performance.

Creator Studio will also now support 13 more languages for auto-captioning: Arabic, Chinese, German, Hindi, Italian, Malay, Russian, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Urdu and Vietnamese. These are in addition to those languages already available, which included English, French, Portuguese and Spanish.
Instagram & IGTV scheduling 
And finally, publishers and creators will be able to publish and schedule their Instagram Feed and IGTV content for up to six months. In a few more months, Instagram Feed and IGTV drafting and editing will also become available, the company says.
This feature was already spotted in the wild before today’s announcement, and it set the social media management and influencer community abuzz. It also follows an update to the Instagram API last year to allow scheduling by third-party applications. However, a native feature is not as limited as some of those other options.
The feature is now open to all creators and publishers with Facebook Pages, whereas before some were seeing it labeled only as “coming soon” or were not able to get it working. Story scheduling is not yet included here, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see it added further down the road.

Reuters
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Monday that the attack on its oil facilities was carried out with Iranian weapons, according to a preliminary investigation, but stopped short of directly blaming regional foe Iran. 
A foreign ministry statement said Riyadh would invite international experts, including from the United Nations, to participate in investigating Saturday’s assault, which cut almost half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production. 
The United States, which has blamed Iran for the strikes, is studying all available options in addressing the assault, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a phone call on Monday, Saudi state media said.  
“Initial investigations show that Iranian weapons were used in the attacks and work is going on to determine the source of those attacks,” the foreign ministry statement said. 
“The kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks,” it added. 
Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement has claimed responsibility for the strikes, but the spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition battling the group said preliminary findings indicated the attack was not launched from Yemen. 
Tehran has dismissed the U.S. accusations as “unacceptable” and said it was ready for a “full-fledged war.” 
Riyadh called on the world to condemn those behind the attack on the world’s top oil exporter, a key regional U.S. ally which has supported U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum-pressure” campaign on Shi’ite Muslim Iran. 
Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, told Esper that Iranian threats “are not only directed to the kingdom, but affect the Middle East and the world,” news agency SPA said. 
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who also called the crown prince on Monday, offered his country’s “full support and capabilities” to the Gulf Arab state, it added.  
The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials had said intelligence indicated Iran was the “staging ground” for the attack and had shared the information with Riyadh. It quoted people familiar with the discussions. 
Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told reporters in Riyadh earlier on Monday that authorities were still determining the launch location. 
“The terrorist attack did not originate from Yemen as the Houthi militia claimed,” he said, adding that authorities would reveal the location from where drones were launched at a future news conference. 
The Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim countries intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognized government from power in the capital Sanaa, to prevent Iran from gaining influence through the group. 
The movement, which denies being a puppet of Tehran and says it is fighting a corrupt system, recently stepped up drone and missile attacks on Saudi cities. The conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Times Now
Rang De Basanti writer Kamlesh Pandey on Sunday said he was so driven to make the Aamir Khan-starrer that he took on the job for "very less" remuneration.
In his career of over 30 years, Pandey has penned blockbusters and acclaimed films like Saudagar, Tezaab and Delhi 6.
At a session organised by the Screenwriters Association (SWA), Pandey said today there is a new plan which ensures fair pay to writers.
"Actors set their own fees, so a writer should also set his/her fees according to how hard one has worked. For example, I took about a year to write Rang De Basanti and it took six years for it to be a final film. The money I got, the spot boy would've got paid more," Pandey said.
"I don't feel sad about that though. I agreed because I wanted to make this film at any cost. It was my decision because I could afford to do that. That I could work for less money," he added.
The writer said money was not a factor for him in his initial days as he was cushioned by an advertising job.
"I moonlighted as an advertising professional and a film-TV writer. I kept the safety net of advertising for a long time, till 1992, and then left it.
"Whether a job or something else, you have to have something for yourself. It wouldn't work if you only depend on writing. If you are a new writer in this expensive city, it's difficult to survive purely on writing."
Pandey further noted a writer must always keep in mind the time his story is set in and update it accordingly.
Citing an example from Rang De Basanti, the scribe said when he was penning the Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra-directed movie, six films on Bhagat Singh had already flopped.
"I was turned down from everywhere because people called it 'another film on Bhagat Singh after six flops'. I told them it's about young India. Bhagat Singh is a device. 'What he would do if he was here today, what are the children of today doing?'

"But people didn't get the script. In fact, we had gone with the film to a big superstar's son. But his mother said My son won't die!" he said.
Asked if a writer should always hold their ground when there is a suggestion from the producer or actor to tweak the script, Pandey said they should roll with it as long as it helps the story.
"The climax of Rang De Basanti was set in the Lok Sabha where the men go and carry a shootout. We debated a month over this that it would never get censor (certificate). You can't use Lok Sabha for this. Aamir said he had an idea.
"For some other film of his, he had kept a situation that the men enter a radio station and give their statement from there. It worked and I said 'It's fantastic, let's do this'. So it isn't that you don't listen to anyone. Whatever works for the benefit of the story, do it," he added.

RT
Ronaldo’s father, Jose Dinis Aveiro, died of liver failure in 2005 at the age of 52 after battling alcoholism.
Ronaldo was 20 at the time and playing for Manchester United, and was on the cusp of becoming the global megastar he is today.
The footballer, 34, wept after being shown footage he had never seen before of his father expressing his pride at his son's achievements at playing for Portugal at Euro 2004.
“I never saw the video. I never saw that video. Unbelievable,” a tearful Ronaldo said.
“I think the interview would be funny, but I didn’t expect to cry. But I never saw these images. I don’t know where you… I have to have these images to show my family.
“But I really don’t know my father 100 per cent. He was a drunk person. I never spoke with him, like a normal conversation. It was hard.”
‘He doesn’t see me receive awards.’In an emotional interview, @Cristiano breaks down in tears over the loss of his late father and the fact that he never got to witness his son's success. Watch the full interview on @ITV on Tuesday at 9pm.@piersmorgan | #GMBpic.twitter.com/LybbJn31VR
Ronaldo’s father was a former solidier who had served in wars in Mozambique and Angola, and his death meant he did not see his son go on to be crowned as a five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or or collect honors such as his five Champions League winners medals or captain Portugal to the European Championship title.    
“To be the number one and he don't see nothing, and he don't see me receive awards, to see what I became,” Ronaldo said as he wiped away tears.
The striker has previously shared pictures with his Instagram followers showing a portrait of his father at his family home.
The football megastar also talked about the impact on his family of allegations that he raped US woman Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Police announced in July that Ronaldo would not face criminal charges due to a lack of evidence, although Mayorga is still pursuing a civil lawsuit against him.

Ronaldo has vehemently denied the allegations, and told Morgan he felt “embarrassed” whenever the case was discussed on TV and his children were around.
“One day I was at home in the living room with my girlfriend and then the news they speak about Cristiano Ronaldo, this and that,” Ronaldo said.
“You listen to you kids coming down the stairs and you change the channel because I was embarrassed, I feel embarrassed.” 
‘I felt embarrassed.’Cristiano Ronaldo opens up to @piersmorgan about the shame he felt when he was accused of rape.You can watch the full interview on @ITV on Tuesday at 9pm. It’s also available on the ITV Hub.@Cristiano | #RonaldoMeetsPiers | #GMBpic.twitter.com/5gtZN2npYE
Ronaldo also said he plans to wed partner Georgina Rodriguez, 25 who is the mother of his daughter Alana Martina, while the footballer has three other children from surrogate mothers.   
“She’s the mum of my kids, and I’m so passion for her, you know.
“It’s great. She’s my friend. We have conversations. I open the heart for her and she open the heart for me,” Ronaldo said.
“We’ll be [married] one day, for sure. It’s my mum’s dream as well. So, one day. Why not?”
Ronaldo's hour-long interview with TV personality Morgan is set to be broadcast on Tuesday on ITV in the UK.

The New Indian Express
Australia’s player of the series in the Ashes Steve Smith became the highest run-scorer in a single Test series in the 21st century, finishing with a mammoth 774 runs at a Bradmanesque average of 110.57 from the four matches he played.
The world number one batsman was in phenomenal form during the Ashes, hitting three hundreds, including one double ton, in the four Tests.
But when former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes was asked to choose between Steve Smith and Virat Kohli, the 50-year-old picked Indian captain Virat Kohli as the best batsman in world cricket right now.
“I enjoy watching Virat Kohli. Steve Smith, with that action and technique, makes the ugliest hundreds I have ever seen but the man just keeps scoring runs.
“Someone who likes to watch cricket would want to say ‘Wow! What an amazing shot’ as opposed to ‘Oh! How on earth can he hit that?’ So Virat Kohli right now,” Rhodes, who was in India as the ambassador for the Covelong festival, told Express during an interaction.
Rhodes, who is regarded as one of the best fielders of all time, picked New Zealand's Martin Guptill and India's Ravindra Jadeja among the best fielders currently. But he regarded Guptill as his favourite.
“Jadeja doesn’t get enough cricket time. Guptill is playing every game. Guptill is great in the slips, great in the covers, great in the boundaries. He is a great all-round fielder, Jadeja has got the X factor. There are really good fielders out there but Guptill for me stands out,” the fielding legend said.

The opening game of the three-match T20I series at Dharamshala on Sunday was abandoned due to rain. South Africa will be keen to get back the winning habit after the flop show in the 2019 World Cup. Kagiso Rabada will continue to lead the pace battery after his amazing performance in the World Cup.
Asked to pick between Rabada and Jasprit Bumrah, the 50-year-old said, “It depends on what you want to do. If you want to knock people down at the start of the game then Rabada, but if you are looking to defend, then Bumrah as he is a specialist.”

Rhodes also revealed that he remained in touch with former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje even after he was banned from international cricket for life after a match-fixing scandal.
“Hansie was somebody whom I had grown up with from the age of 13 playing against each other in various state-level teams. So Hansie and I were really close. Even after his ban for match-fixing, I spent a lot of time with him,” he added.

The News Minute
Less than 4 days after an illegal hoarding turned death trap for a 23-year-old Chennai techie, another life has been lost in the city due to sheer negligence. On Sunday night, Dheena Senthil, a 14-year-old boy was electrocuted to death after coming in contact with an exposed live wire on the street.
The incident happened at around 10 pm in Dhanam Nagar, near the old post office in Chennai’s Mugalivakkam neighbourhood.
Dheena, a resident of the neighbourhood, was walking on the street when he stepped on the electricity board wire which had not been isolated and buried properly by Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) personnel.
Although a few people saw Dheena get electrocuted, they could not rescue him as he died instantly.
According to reports, the road had been dug up by the electricity board to lay wires for street lights and drainage pipes in the locality. However, the works had not been completed and the workers had temporarily covered the wires with mud, instead of isolating and burying them properly.
With rains over the last few days, the mud on top was dislodged, exposing the live wire underneath killing Dheena when he came in contact with it.
Following the boy’s death, several people pointed out the negligence by the Chennai Corporation and the TNEB personnel which led to the tragic incident.
Local channels reported that aggrieved residents staged a protest and halted traffic following the boy’s death on Sunday night and that tensions dissolved only after police officers arrived and promised to take action against the erring TNEB officials.
However, officers of the T4 Mangadu police station who are charged with investigating the case deny that protests had occurred in the neighbourhood.
“A few people had witnessed the boy’s death and had been standing there. However, there were no agitations or protests when we reached there,” an officer from the police station told TNM.
Dheena was a class 9 student of the government higher secondary school in KK Nagar. He is survived by his father Senthil and mother Vanitha. Following his death, Senthil filed a complaint at the Mangadu police station where officers have registered a case under section 304A (death due to negligence) against TNEB personnel.
This the second life lost due to negligence by government bodies in the city within the span of a week. On Thursday, Subhasri, a 23-year-old Chennai techie, passed away after being run over by a tanker lorry on the Thuraipakkam-Pallavaram 200 metre radial stretch. Subhasri, who was riding her two-wheeler, fell on the road after a loose illegal hoarding on the main road collapsed on her. 
The Madras High Court has now ordered disciplinary action against police officers and corporation officials for failing to remove the unauthorised hoardings. The court has ordered an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to be given to Subhasri’s family, allowing the government to recover the amount from the salaries of the errant officials.

The News Minute
In a big win for the students of Hyderabad’s St Francis Women’s College, the management on Monday finally lifted the diktat to wear knee-length kurtis to the college. The students of the college had been protesting against the controversial dress code and had alleged moral policing by the college authorities since August.
On Monday morning, the students had blocked the entrance to the college in order to strike a dialogue with the college management.
Speaking to TNM, a student at the college campus said the dress-code has been lifted and the same was informed to the student representatives who were in discussions with the St. Francis management. "We are now allowed to dress as per the undertaking which allows us to wear clothes except mini-skirts and crop tops," the student added.
The dress code, which was brought into force from August 1, made it mandatory for the students to wear knee-length kurtis. The students were not happy with the decision as it was not easy for a section of students to change their wardrobe in between a semester and also many could not afford the college's new decision. They also said the new dress code didn’t aim at bringing uniformity among students but was a result of regressive patriarchal mind-set.
The students claimed that their attempts to hold a discussion with the management were futile as they were again moral-policed and told that their parents sent them to college in order to “get good marriage proposals” in the future.
The situation worsened on Friday when the college appointed female security guards who heckled the students and prevented them from attending classes for wearing kurtis that were slightly above the knee. A video of the college principal, Sr Sandra Horta, also emerged, where she was seen checking the dress of the students.
A student had then told TNM, “We don't want to be a part of an institution that wants to institutionalise this kind of patriarchy. Speaking to us in such a tone, giving us subliminal messages that we are arousing males, I don't think is a very appropriate environment or a good environment for all of us to be in. I don't think it helps our intellectual development either.”
Despite repeated attempts, the school principal did not respond to the calls or messages from TNM on the issue.

The News Minute
The Enforcement Directorate on Monday filed objections to Congress leader and former Karnataka Minister DK Shivakumar’s bail application at a special court in New Delhi. The ED stated that DK Shivakumar could influence witnesses and tamper with evidence if granted bail.
“'Investigation has revealed names of various persons and entities. Interrogation of these persons is necessary to take the case to its logical conclusion. If granted bail, there exists all likelihood that he will tamper with evidence and influence the witnesses,” the ED’s objection states.
The ED also maintained that DK Shivakumar was not cooperating with the probe despite alleged “evidence linking him with the crime” was put forth before him. 
DK Shivakumar had applied for bail on September 4 at the special court in New Delhi for ED cases.
On September 13, the special court had extended the ED’s custody of DK Shivakumar till Tuesday. The Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, representing the ED, had stated that DK Shivakumar and his family members collectively have 317 bank accounts and accused him of laundering more than Rs 200 crore cash. The ED accused DK Shivakumar and his family members of acquiring assets worth more than Rs 800 crore through tainted money.
The Enforcement Directorate had arrested DK Shivakumar on September 3.  He has been accused of setting up hawala networks to launder money. The ED began probing DK Shivakumar’s alleged money laundering activities after the Income Tax Department had alleged found Rs 8.86 crore in cash at DK Shivakumar’s residence in New Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave in August 2017. 
DK Shivakumar’s daughter Aisshwarya was questioned by the ED last week for 7 hours. Aisshwarya was questioned regarding several of her business transactions in Singapore and India. The ED also questioned her regarding her investment in a green energy company in Kolar and how she had increased her assets from Rs 1.08 crore to Rs 108 crore in a span of five years.

		             NEW DELHI :
For the last two days, Indigo flights from Delhi to Istanbul have been taking off without the checked-in luggage of most of its passengers due to payload restrictions resulting from heavy headwinds, said sources on Monday.
Several passengers, who have travelled on Delhi-Istanbul flights on Saturday and Sunday, have given vent to their ire on social media after reaching their destination without luggage.
IndiGo operates two flights daily on Delhi-Istanbul route.
The two flights -- 6E15 and 6E11 -- depart from Delhi daily at 11.45 am and 2 pm, respectively.
The low-cost carrier uses its A320neo and A321neo aircraft on this route. IndiGo passenger Chandrika Garg tweeted on Monday, "@IndiGo6E Brazen apathy shown by you guys. I, along with other passengers on flight 6E11 on September 14, still haven't received my luggage at Istanbul Airport...Stranded, no luggage/essential medicines/documents. Your service centre in India not helping. @MoCA_GoI help pls." @MoCA_GoI is the Twitter handle for the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
Another passenger Manoj Jaiswal said on Twitter that he travelled on the same 6E11 flight on Saturday "with not a single baggage on-board." Passengers travelling on 6E 11 flight on Sunday (September 15) also underwent the same experience.
A passenger named Chinmay Dabke tweeted on Monday that he travelled on 6E11 flight on Sunday and the "airline did not load the luggage of the entire flight." "Not a single passenger got their luggage," he added.
Gautam Saraf, who was also travelling on the same flight on Sunday, tweeted his boarding pass on Monday morning and complained that he has not received his check-in luggage.
The A320neo and A321neo aircraft used by IndiGo are narrow-body aircraft.
In case there are strong headwinds, the plane has to carry higher amount of fuel, necessitating unloading of passengers and their baggage to reduce weight.
Because of strong headwinds on Delhi-Istanbul route for the last two days, the low-cost carrier has been unable to take most of the check-in luggage in the same aircraft along with passengers, said an airline spokesperson.
"Unfortunately, due to the exceptionally heavy headwind we had certain pay load restrictions on a few fights to Istanbul which led to the off-loading of a limited number of checked-in baggage," he said. "In light of these limitations, we have upgraded our aircraft and adjusted the payload as long as the prevailing wind conditions remain, so all the left behind baggage will be carried today.

However, according to flightradar24.com, the same A321neo aircraft VT-IUD which had been used as 6E11 flight on Saturday and Sunday was used in Monday's 6E11 flight.
According to the website, the 6E15 flight, which departs daily at 11.45 am from Delhi to Istanbul -- was conducted on Monday by the same A320neo aircraft VT-IZP that had flown on saturday and Sunday.

Cricket Country
The BCCI’s Anti-Corruption Unit on Monday has filed a First Information Report (FIR) at the Ashok Nagar Police Station in Bengaluru against Rakesh Bafna and Jitendra Kothari for an alleged attempt to fix an India-England women’s international match this year.
According to a report in Sportstar, Bafna had approached one of the prominent members of the India’s women’s team (name held for security reasons) and offered her huge amount of money if she joined hands with them.
The cricketer was approached in February ahead of India women’s team’s limited-overs series against England – which was part of International Cricket Council (ICC)’s World Championships.
“Today, we have got an FIR registered against two people in Bengaluru. The FIR pertains to an approach that was made to one of the women cricketers of the team. She reported the approach to us and even recorded the conversation she had with one of the accused over the telephone,” BCCI ACU chief, Ajit Singh Shekhawat was quoted as saying in the report.

It was Kothari, who approached the cricketer as a sports manager, via Instagram and offered her managerial services. He then sent her a copy of a contract, but she was unable to sign it since she was touring with the Indian team. Later, she decided not to go ahead with the deal.
Kothari then decided to contact the cricketer, who was at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, again in February this year and he got her in touch with Bafna suggesting to her that he had a business offer for her.
“Kothari was trying to sell himself as the manager of various women cricketers. It was he who introduced Bafna to the player. He approached her to fix matches and play according to the script,” Shekhawat said.
According to the report, Bafna offered the player Rs 1 lakh per match – during the India-England series.
“Initially the call was made via WhatsApp and Bafna said that endorsement would be for a noted Indian clothing brand. But soon, he directly approached her to fix matches. The player told him that there is a bad connection and she could call her on her regular number,” Shekhawat said.

Sensing that the deal was a little fishy, she recorded the conversation and immediately reported the matter to the BCCI ACU. “Bafna took advantage of Kothari’s inaptitude, and the player had rightly made a report of the approachment. Bafna was warned for his action and was reported to the BCCI and ICC.”
The BCCI ACU understood that the approach was malicious with the sole intention to fix matches and decided to go ahead with the FIR.
“People involved in betting just need any cricket match, for them, it does not matter at what level it is being played. If a match is telecast, that helps them in betting and that’s why they indulge in spot-fixing,” he said.
The BCCI ACU has registered the FIR under case number: 312/19 at the Ashok Nagar police station, Bengaluru City.
The case has been registered under the following sections:
IPC Section 420: Indian Penal Code deals with Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property. The maximum punishment which can be awarded is imprisonment for a term of 7 years and fine.
IPC Section 511: Punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment.
IPC Section 120B: Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death, or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards, shall, where no express provision is made in this Code for the punishment of such a conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if he had abetted such offence.
IPC Section 109: Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment. Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abet­ment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. Explanation. An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of the abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.

Daily Mail
Joe Root hailed a ‘phenomenal’ summer of cricket after England squared the Ashes at 2-2 almost exactly two months after Eoin Morgan’s one-day team lifted the World Cup at Lord’s.
England bowled Australia out for 263 at the Oval on the fourth evening of the fifth and final Test to secure the first drawn Ashes series in 47 years. And it left the England captain speaking of launching an assault on the urn Down Under in 2021-22.
‘The performance this week was a lot closer to the template of where we want to be moving forward in Test cricket,’ said Root. ‘Hopefully it’s a massive stepping stone for us to kick on as a team. It looks a hell of a lot better than 3-1.
Joe Root believes England's red-ball team is moving in the right direction after fifth Test win
‘I was desperate to win this series but for English cricket the summer has been a success. It’s been phenomenal cricket. That World Cup was incredible. What a summer of cricket it’s been. We have a great opportunity now to spring the game forward in this country.’
Root’s ambitions will rest heavily on the continued success of Jofra Archer, who bowled a blistering spell to Australian centurion Matthew Wade on Sunday.
‘Jofra’s come in and been fantastic: four Tests, two six-fors,’ said Root. ‘He has a way of having a huge impact on the game. We just have to be careful not to expect too much.’
Root shares the Ashes trophy with Australia's Tim Paine after a first drawn series in 47 years
Asked to assess the herculean contribution of Steve Smith, who was dismissed on Sunday for 23, caught at leg slip by Ben Stokes off Stuart Broad, Root joked: ‘He’s been a pain, really. He’s played extremely well. He’s the No 1 batter in the world for a reason. He’s stood up and done something very special.
‘It was nice to see a plan come together finally, even though it was what we started with at Edgbaston. Finally one went to hand.’
Australian captain Tim Paine admitted: ‘No doubt today puts a dampener on it, but from where this group’s come from, to retain the Ashes is still a big deal. I’m loving the job. I feel there’s some unfinished business but I’m not looking too far down the track. The stick we’ve copped, you can sulk or you can enjoy it.’
Meanwhile, after his last game in charge, England head coach Trevor Bayliss said the only international gig he would now consider was that of his native Australia. He added: ‘But it’s in good hands: Justin Langer is doing a good job.’

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force has taken the lead towards gender equality yet again, with Wing Commander Anjali Singh becoming the nation’s first woman defence attaché at an Indian mission abroad.
So far all defence attachés, whether from the Army, Air Force or Navy, have only been male officers.
Wing Commander Singh has been posted at India’s embassy in Moscow and she took charge as deputy air attaché last Monday.  
“Wing Commander Anjali Singh of the aeronautical engineering branch has been approved as deputy air attaché,” a defence source confirmed. She is expected to present her credentials in the next 10 days.
With her appointment, yet another area in the male-dominated defence services has opened up for women. The IAF has often led by example, becoming the first military service to open its fighting arm to women when it selected three female officers to become fighter pilots.
The Navy has also started the process of identifying women officers for appointments in Indian missions abroad.
“The Navy has identified positions where women officers can be posted and the shortlisting is in progress,” two Navy sources confirmed.
As for the Army, the appointment of women attachés is expected to take time. This is because most of the positions are Colonel-rank and above and women officers are only now beginning to become Colonels. 
“It will take some time before a woman Army officer is posted as an Army attaché. They have to complete their command tenure before becoming eligible,” a senior officer said.  
The process of appointing women defence attachés was started by Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman when she was defence minister. 
Attachés play a crucial role in the country’s military diplomacy. There are 95 countries where India has defence attachés, including deputies.
At some embassies, there are officers from all three services. They assist in defence cooperation, training, procurement and security among others.
The numbers of women officers and percentage compared to male officers in the three services of armed forces are as under:

The New Indian Express
MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court on Monday expressed displeasure over the probe report submitted by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the murder case of CPI leader Govind Pansare.
The report “lacks independent steps” and the things “need t be moving”, noted the bench of justices SC Dharmadhikari and GS Patel, as they heard the petitions filed by kin of Pansare and rationalist Narendra Dabholkar seeking a court-monitored probe in their killings.
“The investigating officer has failed to list any independent steps in this report. Whatever you (SIT) have stated here is all resting on the probe in other cases (the probe into killings of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and journalist Gauri Lankesh),” the bench said.
“We must convey our unhappiness. Things are not moving. We are refraining from passing critical order against the officer only in light of prevailing conditions of continuous rains in the area. But we hope the SIT will submit a better and comprehensive report next time,” the bench added.
The court said the only reason it was refraining from passing a more critical order was that it realised the officer concerned had failed to make any significant progress in the past few weeks due to floods in Kolhapur.
Earlier, during the hearing, the CBI, which is investigating the Dabholkar case, also submitted a progress report on its probe.
While Dabholkar was shot dead on August 20, 2013 in Pune, Pansare was shot at on February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur and succumbed to his injuries a few days later on February 20. The SIT was formed after the family members of Pansare and Dabholkar moved HC demanding court monitoring of the probe.
Meanwhile, a court in Kolhapur increased the police custody awarded to the three accused in Pansare murder case by another 4 days. Sachin Andure, Amit Baddi and Ganesh Miskin were sent to 10 days of custody on September 6. They were presented before the court upon completion of the remand. The court awarded additional four day’s custody to the police.
During interrogation the three accused revealed names of three other who had companied them to the jungles near Belgaum where they underwent training on an air pistol. The trio had conducted recce in various parts of Kolhapur to target Pansare. However, Andure, the key person, is not providing complete information, the SIT told th Court.
Andure is suspected to be the shooter who shot at Dabholkar in Pune.

The Financial Express
Ayushman Bharat ‘Name and Shame’ guidelines: Health insurance fraudsters under Ayushman Bharat should be publicly named and shamed in a bid to deter them from committing malpractices, a Joint Working Group (JWG) report of National Health Authority (NHA) and IRDAI has recommended. The fraudsters may include hospitals, health care providers, intermediaries and policyholders. The report defines ‘Name and Shame’ as “a system for public dissemination of information about an entity/person/organization involved in committing fraud under a health protection scheme of the Government or under an insurance program/policy.”
If implemented, the JWG recommendations may affect a big change in the overall health insurance sector as well in the long run and benefit common people. While naming and shaming of defaulters is a regular practice in the banking sector, there is no clearly defined policies or guidelines for such practices for the health insurance sector. The NHA-IRDAI report may become the first step in this regard.
The JWG has made recommendations for naming and shaming of fraudsters for discussion and deliberation among the health insurance stakeholders in India. The report notes “insurance industry would benefit by developing the guidelines for intermediaries, rogue policyholders.”
ALSO READ |Ayushman Bharat: NHA, IRDAI launch ‘four’ reports to further strengthen AB-PMJAY
In what may be a “small beginning at different – incremental levels” to prevent health insurance frauds and give more power to policyholders, the JWG has made the following recommendations:
When the fraudulent activity has been confirmed, the government authority /agency/insurance firm /TPA (third-party administrator) should take following steps:
– Issue warning or show-cause notice to the hospitals found to be indulging in fraudulent activities, depending on the seriousness of the fraud.
– The warning, or show cause notice, should be followed by the process of suspension and de-empanelment as per the contract.
The hospital would removed from the list of network hospitals if it fails to “satisfactorily explain/respond to show-cause notice or continue to indulge in malpractice”.
– The list of de-empanelled/blacklisted hospitals will be mentioned on the website of the Government Authority/SHA/Agency/Insurance firm/ TPA. The JWG has recommended that this list should be “prominently displayed and easily accessible on the website”.
– Hospitals which have been served with warnings, show-cause notice or suspended temporarily will also be mentioned in a separate list on the websites.
– The de-empanelled hospital may be allowed to re-apply for empanelment after a gap of minimum 6 months-1 years after it submits proof of having “mended unethical ways”.
– The IRDAI may prepare an industry de-empanelled/blacklist every and display on its website. The NHA will prepare a similar list for hospitals empanelled with PM-JAY/Government schemes.
– The JWG has also recommended to sensitize and inform policyholders and health workers about the de-empanelled hospitals. Setting up of Whistle Blower mechanisms has also been recommended.
Commenting on the recommendations, Dr Indu Bhushan, CEO, NHA had stated, “The recommendations in the report are a step forward in enabling quality healthcare and access to the patients. These reports would help further strengthen the transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of AB-PM-JAY, benefitting millions in India directly.”

https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/spot-boy-wouldve-got-paid-more-rang-de-basanti-writer-kamlesh-on-getting-paid-less-for-aamir-khan-starrer/489581?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
Times Now
Rang De Basanti writer Kamlesh Pandey on Sunday said he was so driven to make the Aamir Khan-starrer that he took on the job for "very less" remuneration.
In his career of over 30 years, Pandey has penned blockbusters and acclaimed films like Saudagar, Tezaab and Delhi 6.
At a session organised by the Screenwriters Association (SWA), Pandey said today there is a new plan which ensures fair pay to writers.
"Actors set their own fees, so a writer should also set his/her fees according to how hard one has worked. For example, I took about a year to write Rang De Basanti and it took six years for it to be a final film. The money I got, the spot boy would've got paid more," Pandey said.
"I don't feel sad about that though. I agreed because I wanted to make this film at any cost. It was my decision because I could afford to do that. That I could work for less money," he added.
The writer said money was not a factor for him in his initial days as he was cushioned by an advertising job.
"I moonlighted as an advertising professional and a film-TV writer. I kept the safety net of advertising for a long time, till 1992, and then left it.
"Whether a job or something else, you have to have something for yourself. It wouldn't work if you only depend on writing. If you are a new writer in this expensive city, it's difficult to survive purely on writing."
Pandey further noted a writer must always keep in mind the time his story is set in and update it accordingly.
Citing an example from Rang De Basanti, the scribe said when he was penning the Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra-directed movie, six films on Bhagat Singh had already flopped.
"I was turned down from everywhere because people called it 'another film on Bhagat Singh after six flops'. I told them it's about young India. Bhagat Singh is a device. 'What he would do if he was here today, what are the children of today doing?'

"But people didn't get the script. In fact, we had gone with the film to a big superstar's son. But his mother said My son won't die!" he said.
Asked if a writer should always hold their ground when there is a suggestion from the producer or actor to tweak the script, Pandey said they should roll with it as long as it helps the story.
"The climax of Rang De Basanti was set in the Lok Sabha where the men go and carry a shootout. We debated a month over this that it would never get censor (certificate). You can't use Lok Sabha for this. Aamir said he had an idea.
"For some other film of his, he had kept a situation that the men enter a radio station and give their statement from there. It worked and I said 'It's fantastic, let's do this'. So it isn't that you don't listen to anyone. Whatever works for the benefit of the story, do it," he added.

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to ensure normal life is restored in Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest.
Issuing a list of orders in petitions related to abrogation of the provisions under Article 370 which gave special status to the state, the apex court bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, also directed the Centre to ensure smooth functioning of schools, hospitals and public transport.
Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, apprising the court of the situation in the state said, "Not a single bullet has been fired, there has been no loss of life."
On the restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre said curbs in areas under 93 police stations have been lifted. When the court said the Centre should make healthcare facilities accessible, Mehta read out a detailed report on the functioning of outpatient departments (OPD) and medical shops across the state.
The bench, comprising Justices SA Bopde and SA Nazeer, was hearing a batch of petitions filed by editor of Kashmir Times Anuradha Bhasin and political analyst Tehseen Poonawalla challenging the lockdown in the state.

CricTracker
There is little denying the fact that Rishabh Pant is set to get an extended run in the Indian team across formats. The highly-rated youngster is being widely seen as MS Dhoni’s apt replacement. Thus the team-management is unlikely to drop Pant anytime soon. However, India head coach Ravi Shastri has sent a timely reminder to the youngster about his place in the team.
Shastri has made it clear that Pant cannot take his position in the side for granted, saying that the youngster will be ‘rapped on the knuckles’ if he keeps on playing rash shots. Pant received widespread criticism for his performance in West Indies. It was the first time, he was picked in the ODI and the T20I side as the number one wicketkeeper-batsman. A good outing in the Caribbean Islands would have pretty much sealed Pant’s place in the team.

However, the Delhi star failed to grab the opportunity and performed miserably. Barring the fifty in the third T20I, he did not make much of an impact. What made things worse for him was his poor shots. Pant showed little application and was out playing rash shots more often than not. But Shastri has now sent a timely reminder to Pant, asking the batsman to bat smartly.
“We’ll let him be but at times when you see a shot, like the first ball dismissal in Trinidad, if he repeats that, then he will be told. There will be a rap on the knuckles, talent or no talent,” Shastri told Star Sports.
“As simple as that. Because you are letting the team down, forget letting yourselves down. In a situation where you have the captain at the other end, a target to chase, the need of the hour is sensible cricket,” he added.
While Rishabh Pant’s aggressive batting style has often attracted debate, Shastri said that changing the style is never an option. The coach said that the batsmen need to read the game well in order to succeed. He also asked Pant to step up and start delivering.
“No one will even think of changing his style. Like Virat said, reading the situation, match-awareness and shot-selection becomes crucial. If he can fathom that, he could be unstoppable. It could take one game, it could take four games. He has played so much IPL cricket, he will learn. It’s time now for him to step up and show how devastating he can be,” Shastri said with captain Virat Kohli by his side.

The Quint
England beat Australia by 135 runs in the fifth and final Ashes Test at the Oval on Sunday, 15 September, to draw the series 2-2.
It's the first time an Ashes series has ended in a draw since 1972.
Australia had already retained the urn as holder but was thwarted in its goal of a first outright series win in England in 18 years after being dismissed for 263 in its second innings deep into the evening session on Day 4.
Both teams had something to celebrate as Australia was later presented with the series trophy and the Ashes urn.
"We were excellent this week. Having lost the toss, to play as we did was fantastic. We drove the game all the time and got there in the end," England captain Joe Root said.
Steve Smith proved a formidable presence at No. 4 for Australia throughout the series but was caught by Ben Stokes at leg gully off pacer Stuart Broad for 23, by far his lowest score of the series.
Smith finished with 774 runs in the series in seven innings at an average of 110. The star batter received a standing ovation from England and Australia fans as he left the field on Sunday, a strong sign Smith has been forgiven after a ban for his role in a ball-tampering scandal.
Matthew Wade was Australia's top scorer with 117 after beginning to worry England as the visitors chased an unlikely winning target of 399. Wade was stumped off a delivery from Root.
Broad took 4-62 and spinner Jack Leach 4-49 for England.
Earlier, England resumed its second innings on 313-8 and was all out for 329.
"England got ahead of the game. I can't read a pitch so I'm always 50-50. We've got to bat, bowl better than we did in this test match," Australia captain Tim Paine said.
"No doubt today puts a dampener on it, but from where this group's come from, to retain the Ashes is still a big deal."
Australia won the first Test at Edgbaston by 251 runs, the next Test at Lord's was drawn before England drew level with a one-wicket win in a thrilling third Test at Headingley, which Smith missed. Australia won the fourth Test at Old Trafford by 185 runs.

Cricket Country
One batsman who will want to quickly forget the Ashes 2019 series is David Warner, who’s horrific show with the bat ended with a dreadful average of just 9.50.
Stuart Broad terrorised Warner with his around-the-wicket line and removed the southpaw for the seventh time across his 10 innings that set a new Test record.
Such an instance has occurred on only five other occasions when a bowler dismissed a player seven times in a single series. The last time this happened was in the previous Ashes series where Australia spin bowler Nathan Lyon haunted Moeen Ali.
READ: David Warner’s horror Ashes series ends as Stuart Broad gets him out for record-equalling 7th time
Despite his form, Warner found vital support from head coach Justin Langer. “I think, talking frankly, he let Stuart Broad get into his head and he thought way too much about it,” Langer said.
After his 61-run knock in the first innings of the third Test at Headingley, the 11 runs he scored in his final innings at Manchester on Sunday was Warner’s second highest score in the series. He also has 3 consecutive ducks in the series.
“I’ve seen it before, even with the great players, every now and then they have a series – and I’m talking about the all-time great players – they have a series where…I remember Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) with Andrew Flintoff, I remember seeing Steve Waugh sit on the team bus in South Africa and the guy had been a run machine for so long, he got out just before stumps and I, in a sick sort of way, thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen,” Langer said.
ALSO READ: Steve Smith, Pat Cummins remain on top in Test Rankings
“In this instance I don’t think David solved the puzzle, and he’ll be first to admit that, he’ll probably be very relieved he gets on the Qantas flight in a day’s time and doesn’t have to face Stuart Broad for a while I reckon. But he is certainly, there’s plenty of upside still to his batting. I’ve learned over a long period you never write off champion players, it doesn’t matter what sport, you never write off champion players. They tend to come good, don’t they? So, he’s had a tough series, no doubt about that, but he’s also a champion player so usually with champion players they get a bit more time to come good.”
Meanwhile, Langer believes that although there has been great improvement in the Australian team over his 16 months in charge, there should be more for the side to reach greatness.
“It’s something we’re getting better at, how we back up after a win.
“That probably comes with the maturity of the group as well. It’s ok to fight back when you are underdogs and it’s one of those Australian things – we love the underdog tag. To fight back from a tough loss is admirable and I said how proud I was with everyone for that.

“But also over the last couple of years we haven’t necessarily performed at our best after a win. Really good teams do that. We didn’t do that too well after the first Test at Lord’s. We didn’t do it after this Test. There have been some Test series over the last couple of years where the team hasn’t been able to. I think that’ll be part of the maturity of our side. If you probably think about it, the way we were in this series, we aren’t a great team yet.
“We are a good team, we are a maturing team. We have got some great players in it. But we’re aspiring to be a great cricket team. You got to work hard and get consistent results to achieve that. That comes from experience and learning how to win. That comes with players individually getting more experienced and the team working together. Those sort of things evolve I think.”

The News Minute
The Central Government has finalized the draft policy guidelines for the car-pooling service being run as a commercial venture by private car owners. This is being worked on by the Ministry of Transportation’s road transport division.  
According to an Economic Times report, the highlights of the guidelines include a KYC of users of the service to be made mandatory and fixing a maximum of four rides per day per individual. The Ministry may first place the draft guidelines for obtaining comments from the public before forwarding them to the states.
The crux of this policy will be that the venture must be run on a ‘no-profit-no-loss’ basis. The broad objective is to share the cost of using the vehicles between the users so that no one is at a loss and at the same time, there will be lesser number of cars on the roads bringing the pollution and traffic levels down a notch.
Some of the other suggestions include the stipulation that the car-pooling service must be offered through an app. Whoever is administering the app will have to be made responsible for a proper KYC of the car owner as well as the riders before they are allowed to be part of the ecosystem.
The states can add a small fee to be paid to it out of the carpooling service operations, if wanted.
The new guidelines will also ensure that the states get some revenue from carpooling. This suggestion is aimed at making the state government have a vested interest in running this facility and encouraging it. There are apps already in operation, like Quick Ride and BlaBlaCar. These will have to make suitable changes to their applications once the guidelines are approved and become law in the respective states.
If the app-based hail-a-cab operators like Ola and Uber wish to enter the carpooling business, they will have to create a separate platform and not include it in their existing arrangement as per these guidelines.  
This policy framework is part of the larger National Mission for Transformative Mobility announced by the government earlier.

The News Minute
Even as many restaurants stay logged out of Zomato, trouble has spilled to its delivery business as thousands of delivery executives in Bengaluru and Mumbai are protesting against the food aggregator over revised rate cards. Around 3000 delivery executives in Mumbai and another 3000 in Bengaluru have logged out of the app and have been protesting since Saturday.
The bone of contention is the change in their payment systems. Delivery executives are given rate cards which define how much they will be paid per delivery and lays out incentives based on orders completed and kilometres travelled.
Delivery executives claim that Zomato has reduced their per delivery earning, increased the number of orders that will earn them an incentive and has also increased the kilometres they need to travel to get additional bonus.
In Bengaluru, delivery executives earlier earned Rs 40 per delivery, which has now been reduced to Rs 30. In terms of incentives, the executives were earlier paid Rs 550 as incentive for 15 deliveries on weekends. This has been changed to Rs 500 for 18 deliveries. Zomato has also allegedly increased the distance required (from 4 kms to 5.5 kms) to make workers eligible to receive ‘bonus points’.

Zomato delivery executives protesting in HSR Layout, Bengaluru
Wasim a native of Kolkata, who joined Zomato a year ago was earning Rs 34,000 -- minus fuel cost of Rs 6000 – after working for 15-16 hours a day. "Now for the last three days, I have logged out. My wife is pregnant, my costs will further go up. It will be impossible to make a living. I have a small loan to service also. Earlier we had bonuses for every order in excess of 5km. Now this is no longer there. It is very hard to compete 20 orders in a day with the new target of 24 orders, it is impossible to get the incentive which is the most important part,” he says.
The situation is similar in Mumbai. Delivery executives, who earlier got paid Rs 35 per delivery, will now be paid only Rs 25. And while they used to get Rs 240 as an incentive on completing 11 orders, this has now changed to 14 orders.
Rakesh, a delivery executive in Mumbai says that they were promised earnings of up to Rs 20,000 for part time and Rs 40,000 for full time. “We now work for 12 hours and still barely earn Rs 20,000. Of that we need to spend for petrol and mobile recharge. Petrol prices are increasing. In any company, salary increases as time goes. So on what basis is Zomato reducing our earnings?” he asks.

Zomato delivery executives protesting in Mumbai
Prakash*, a college student who funds himself and his family says that his monthly earning will be affected by nearly Rs 5000 with the new rates.
"On Thursday, I had logged in for the whole day and I made Rs 1400 on the app. Now imagine if I had to spend almost the whole day and logged out at 11 pm to make that. In the current situation, I have to deliver more orders, which would mean an additional three hours on the app to make the same amount. Do you think this is possible? If I do the same work as now, I would only make Rs 1200,” he says.
Delivery executives also claim that the number of orders they have been receiving has significantly come down. And this is mainly because of the number of delivery executives Zomato has onboarded. This would mean that it takes longer for an executive to receive an order and takes even longer to complete the required number of orders to receive an incentive.

Zomato delivery executives protesting in Worli, Mumbai
Sivanandan, another delivery executive from Mumbai claims that the company does not even help them when they meet with accidents and get injured. “Zomato says they are running under loss. But the real loss is for us – we pay for petrol, for mobile bills and even medical bills when we meet with an accident,” he adds.
Several delivery executives in Bengaluru too, shared instances of them meeting with an accident resulting in severe injuries and Zomato taking no responsibility for the same.
Delivery executives in Bengaluru have now written to Zomato opposing the new incentive scheme and that order distance also be reduced so that it doesn’t take them too long to deliver. They will be meeting with the company later today.
Shaheed from Mumbai, however, claims that Zomato is not paying heed to their demands. Some executives were called for a meeting, but there hasn’t been any resolution.
“We have given Zomato so much of our time. Our main demand is that the old rate system and incentive system be restored,” Shaheed adds.
While Zomato did not specifically respond to TNM’s questions on how the new scheme will work, a company spokesperson said, “Different metrics such as base pay, user satisfaction, delivery touchpoints, minimum guarantee etc. help us appreciate our delivery partners in accordance with their efforts. Reduced average delivery time (less than 30 mins) and increased system efficiency have enabled our delivery partners to perform more deliveries in the same amount of time.”
“We regret the inconvenience caused to our users and are continuously working to resume our services in the affected areas,” it added.

The New Indian Express
BALANGIR: A huge quantity of fake cosmetic products, including shampoo and face wash, was seized from several shops in Kantabanji on Saturday night. 

Acting on a tip-off, a team of Kantabaji police and officials of Hindustan Unilever Ltd conducted raids on several stores in Kantabanji over allegations of adulterated beauty products being sold there.
A large number of shampoo sachets and similar products, which were found to be spurious, were seized during the raids. Police have detained two businessmen in this connection for questioning.

The raids were conducted on the basis of allegations made by residents of Kantabanji on sale of substandard products of the company in the area. Sources said fake beauty products of popular brands were being sold in several shops since long.
“We received complaints from many customers over the quality of products. Basing on the complaints, we purchased several products from various stores posing as customers. Later, we found that duplicate products were being sold under our company’s brand,” said lawyer of Hindustan Unilever Ltd Nayantara.

A formal complaint in this regard will be lodged with police soon, company officials said.

Though the value of the seized goods is yet to be ascertained, two traders have been detained. Further investigation is underway, said police.
Kantabanji had hogged headlines after a fake medicine racket was busted in 2007. The Crime Branch raided the factory engaged in manufacturing fake medicines in Kantabanji and arrested kingpin of the racket Shankar Agarwal. Apart from fake allopathic medicines, Agarwal was also manufacturing ayurvedic and homoeopathic drugs.
Similarly, rackets involved in manufacturing fake stamp paper and lubricants were also busted in Kantabanji.

The New Indian Express
Kerala government will write a letter to the centre seeking clarification on the implementation of the increased fines as per the new amendments in the Motor vehicles act.
The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Transport Minister AK Saseendran here on Monday morning.
"There is a lack of logic in the new rule. The centre should make its stand on the rule very clear and also about how we should go about imposing it," said the minister addressing the media after the meeting.
As of now, there are limitations to the deductions the state government can make in the increased fines.
There are a few categories where an upper limit for fine is mentioned where the state government can decide the fine amount like rash driving where the fine amount can be between Rs 1000 and Rs 5000.

The New Indian Express
BENGALURU: Karnataka Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K S Eshwarappa, who ahead of the LS polls made a controversial comment that Muslims won't be given tickets by BJP, on Sunday said patriotic Muslims will vote for the saffron party while those who are pro-Pakistan will hesitate.
The senior BJP leader also announced that the party-led government will ban slaughter of cows in the state.
"Everyone has a wish for Akhanda Bharat, why it is not happening is because of fear that they (section of politicians) may not get Muslim votes." Eshwarappa said.
Speaking at an event here, he said, "Before BJP government came to power I happened to meet couple of Congress MLAs who expressed desire to come to BJP, but claimed that they have over 50,000 Muslim votes in their constituencies and may face defeat if they lose that, which is kind of a 'Hijada' (eunuch) behaviour."
Eshwarappa also claimed that in his constituency in Shivamogga, there were over 50,000 Muslim voters and he has never gone to them seeking votes.
"I told them (Congress MLAs) that in my constituency, my community- Kuruba vote is about 8,000-10,000 and there is more than 50,000 Muslim votes. I have till today not gone to a single Muslim saluting him for vote. I have won by a lead of over 47,000 votes," he said.
"Why I'm saying this-Journalists write down this. A rashtra bhakta (patriot) Muslim will vote for BJP, and those who are pro Pakistan and rashtra drohis (traitors) will hesitate to vote for BJP," the Minister added.
Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in April, Eshwarappa had said the BJP would not give tickets to Muslims to contest the elections as they do not believe in the party.
On banning cow slaughter in the state, he said, "Cow slaughter is banned in a way, but it has to be done completely. When there was BJP government in the past we had done it, but Congress government came to power and removed it. I'm saying this in this meeting, in front of holy seers that this government will ban cow slaughter, let there be no doubt."
Despite resistance from the opposition, the then BJP government led by B S Yediyurappa in 2010 had got the controversial Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill passed that proposed to replace the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964.
The bill had widened the definition of 'cattle' and imposed a blanket ban on cattle slaughter, coupled with stringent penalty clauses for violation.
However, the Congress government headed by Siddaramaiah that came to power in 2013, withdrew the bill that was before the President for his assent.
Recently, Vijayapura MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal and BJP's Gau Samrakshana Prakoshta, had written to the state government to re-enact the cow slaughter prevention bill.

AttainU, a Bengaluru-based edtech startup providing live online courses as college alternative to individuals, has raised an undisclosed sum in angel funding from investors including Shailesh Rao ex-Google India Head, Nikhil Rungta ex-Intuit India Head, Anil Gelra - Founder, SnapMint and  Manish Kumar - Founder, KredX and LetsVenture. 
 
The raised funding will be used to further strengthen faculty, development of courses, counselling teams, and build a semi-automated platform to cater to the huge inbound student demand AttainU is receiving, the startup stated. 
 
Divyam Goel, CEO & Co-founder, AttainU, said, 
 
“At this point, we are receiving double-digit thousand student applications every month and are very excited about the scale of impact we will be able to deliver through our tech-first approach," he added.

AttainU Founders (L-R) - Vaibhav Bajpai, Divyam Goel
 
Founded by Divyam Goel and Vaibhav Bajpai in 2018, AttainU currently offers full-time, online seven-month-long software engineering courses for users. 
 
The startup provides career counselling as part of their student assessment process and connects graduates to industry partners for placement upon completion of the course. AttainU aims to serve students who have a college education but don’t have a job or a satisfactory job and more importantly, don't need to have prior coding experience. 
 
The company said its courses are focussed on industry-aligned practical skills and professionally required life skills and follow a deferred fee payment model conditional to employment aka Income Share Agreement (ISA). 
 
Commenting on the angel round, Nikhil Rungta, ex-Intuit India MD, said, 
 
According to AttainU, every year approximately nine million students graduate from colleges, out of which 85 percent don’t make it to well paying, white collar jobs. Data states that 50 percent of all BE/Btech graduates and 60 percent of all MBA (including PG Diploma) graduates are still considered not employable by tech first organisations.
 
“The team at AttainU has identified this huge unsolved problem and are trying to solve it in a tech-first, structured and scalable way. Divyam and Vaibhav have been able to put together a good team which not only has domain expertise but is also passionate about solving this huge problem,” added Nikhil.

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has praised the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, adding that he would introduce a similar drive in his state if the need arose.
In an interview with an English daily, Adityanath said that the NRC exercise was brave and important.
"These things are being implemented phase-wise and I feel that when Uttar Pradesh will need an NRC, we will do so. In the first phase, it has been Assam and the way it is being implemented there, it can be an example for us," the Chief Minister told the daily.
Adityanath said that the exercise was important for national security and would put an end to the suffering of the poor due to illegal immigration.
Last month, the Assam government released the final NRC list in the state, leaving out over 19 lakh people. The massive drive was carried out with an aim to drive out illegal settlers from Assam.
Earlier, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari had sought an NRC for the capital city and on Sunday, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that he was exploring legal options to carry out a similar exercise in his state.

PARIS: Former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked classified documents detailing government surveillance programs, is calling on French President Emmanuel Macron to grant him asylum.
Snowden, now living in Russia to avoid prosecution in the United States, stressed in an interview broadcast Monday on France's Inter radio that "protecting whistleblowers is not a hostile act" and that he feels entitled to get protected status in France.
Snowden unsuccessfully applied for asylum in France in 2013 under Macron's predecessor, Francois Hollande.
He has also sought asylum in several other countries.
Snowden's memoir, telling his life story in detail for the first time, will be released Tuesday in about 20 countries, including France.
The French presidency did not comment.

From Radhika Apte to Kalki Koechlin and even Vidya Balan, actors have spoken about their casting couch experiences. The latest actor to open up is Zareen Khan. In an interview to Pinkvilla, Zareen said that she had experienced casting couch on two occasions during her initial days in the industry.
She spoke about one of the horrific instances at length when a director asked her to rehearse a kissing scene.

“The director asked me to rehearse a kissing scene with him. At that point of time I was very new and the director kept telling me to let go of my inhibitions,” Zareen said. She also added that she replied, “What? I am not doing any kissing scene as a rehearsal.”
That wasn’t it. Another person also asked Zareen if she would be interested in “being more than friends.” He also said that if she said yes he would particularly look at the projects she was getting.
Recently, Zareen was trolled for putting up a pictures of her wearing a crop top through which her stretch marks could be seen. The photos were taken during a trip to Jaipiur.
Zarine responded to the negative comments she received with a note stating that “believes in being real and embraced her imperfections with pride rather than covering it up.”
She also explained that the marks were the result of losing a large amount of weight without surgical correction. “For people who are very curious to know about what's wrong with my stomach, this is the natural stomach of a person, who has lost 15 kgs of weight, this is how it looks when it is not photoshopped or surgically corrected,” Zareen said.
On film front, Zareen will be soon be seen in Hum Bhi Akele Tum Bhi Akele. Anushka meanwhile has not signed any films since Zero but is producing a project for streaming giant Netflix.

Greetings from well-wishers make him feel "74 years young", Congress leader P Chidambaram, in jail on charges of corruption, said through his family on his birthday on Monday, and added that his thoughts on the day are on the economy.
Birthday wishes for Chidambaram, who is in judicial custody in Tihar jail in connection with alleged corruption in clearances given to INX Media when he was finance minister, came from his party colleagues as well as his son Karti Chidambaram. The veteran Congress leader thanked everybody and said his spirits had been “lifted higher”.
In another tweet, he said his thoughts today are about the country's economy.
"... Just one statistic tells the story. Export growth in August was -6.05%. No country has achieved GDP growth of 8% without exports growing at 20% a year," he said.
In a letter to his father on his 74th birthday, Karti informed his father about events that had transpired since he had been put in jail, and used the opportunity to take swipes at the BJP government.
"...your birthday is not the same without you with us. We miss you, and your absence tugs at our hearts, and we wish you were back home to cut the cake with us. But of course, in today's day and age, turning 74 is nothing compared to turning 100 days old," Karti said in the letter.
The BJP government, he added, celebrates its "unpropitious second innings" and couldn't have possibly found a better time to silence his father.

Co-living and home rental platform NestAway has been in talks for a bigger round for the past 10-12 months. While the planning to close Series D round in the range of $150 million hasn’t materialised yet, the firm is picking up risk capitals in small trances from new and existing investors.
In May, Tiger Global and Chiratae ventures had participated in Series D round with $10 million investment followed by UC RNT Fund, which had put in $5 million in the Bengaluru-based startup.
Now, another existing investor Goldman Sachs has pumped close to $5 million into the startup.
According to RoC filing with MCA, NestAway has allotted 18,882 Series CCPS at Rs 25,151.87 per share to Goldman Sachs, raising a total of Rs 34.92 crore.
The latest tranche would help NestAway to expand its offerings, especially newly launched separate co-living cum co-working brand – Hello World.
Lately, the competition for NestAway has become more intense following the foray of OYO, hotel chain Lemon Tree and realty firm Embassy Group into the co-living segment.
Besides, numerous startups such as CoHo and Zolstays, StayAbode among others also compete with NestAway.
While the startups above are far behind NestAway in terms of capital raised and onboarding marquee investors, the entry of hotel chains, realty firm and billion-dollar valued OYO in this space are concerns for Amrendra Sahu-led company.
Co-living and co-working are highly unorganised market and create a massive opportunity across major cities such as Bengaluru, Pune, NCR, Hyderabad, and Chennai. According to a Prop Tiger report, the co-living spaces have the potential to become a $93 billion industry.
Recently, Nestway’s co-founder and CXO, Deepak Dhar, had decided to end his journey at the home rental portal to start his own fintech business.

The Financial Express
Even as the Supreme Court continues to hear the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title-suit case on a daily basis, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said that his party workers have been asked to prepare to lay the first brick for Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Thackeray said their hopes have increased with “all that the government was doing” under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He also said that it was “not right to keep waiting” for the construction of Ram temple anymore.
“Our Shivsainiks have been asked to prepare to lay the first brick for Ram Temple, our hopes have increased with all that the government is doing, it’s not right to keep waiting anymore,” Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. This is the second time in just weeks that Shiv Sena chief has expressed confidence that Ram Temple would be built under Prime Minister Modi.
Earlier this month, Uddhav Thackeray shared the dais with the Prime Minister at an event organised to mark the laying of the foundation stone for three metro lines in Mumbai. Addressing the gathering there, he had made a similar remark and said: “I am assuring you in the presence of Prime Minister that Ram Mandir will be built under his leadership in Ayodhya.” Shiv Sena chief further said that all those things which he had been promising to implement for so many years have now been fulfilled by PM Modi.
“I am proud that Article 370 has been abrogated. This promise has been fulfilled. I am sure that we will build the Ram temple in Ayodhya,” Thackeray said. The confidence of BJP supporters has shot up after Prime Minister Modi abrogated special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370. This was one of the key promises that BJP and Shiv Sena had been making for decades.
While the BJP was expected to act on Article 370 — it figured prominently in its election manifesto for Lok Sabha elections — that the government would remove this so soon was not anticipated. With the abolition of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and triple talaq, Modi dared to go where no politician could in the past, considering the possible political repercussions. These bold moves of Modi have sent a signal that his government can deliver on its promises. Ayodhya dispute is currently before the Supreme Court which is hearing the matter on a daily basis.
Prime Minister Modi has maintained on several occasions that the matter is before the Supreme Court and his government would wait for the court to arrive at a conclusion. Thackeray’s increased mentions of the Ram Temple comes just ahead of the Assembly polls in the state scheduled for later this year. The issue has acted as a plank for the party’s campaigns several times in the past.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday President Hassan Rouhani will not meet with  U.S. President Donald Trump at the United Nations, a day after the White House left open the possibility of talks between them. 
“Neither is such an event on our agenda, nor will it happen. Such a meeting will not take place,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in remarks carried by state TV. 
Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected a meeting and any talks with Washington while Iran is subject to sanctions, which Trump re-imposed after withdrawing last year from Tehran’s 2015 nuclear accords with world powers. 
Iran earlier condemned as “unacceptable” U.S. accusations it was behind an attack on Saudi oil plants, after the United States said it was “locked and loaded” for a potential response. The strikes were claimed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. 
“Stopping all sanctions is an indispensable precondition for constructive diplomacy. We hold meetings when we are sure that our people’s problems can be solved,” government spokesman Ali Rabiei said, according to the semi-official news agency Tasnim.  
“Sanctions must be lifted, and the United States must respect the Iranian nation,” Rabiei said. 
White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Sunday the previous day’s attacks “did not help” prospects for a meeting between the two leaders during the United Nations General Assembly this month, but she left open the possibility a meeting could take place.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi movement said on Monday that Saudi Aramco’s oil processing plants were still a target and could be attacked at “any moment”, warning foreigners to leave the area.  
The attacks on Aramco plants in Abqaiq and Khurais in the kingdom’s eastern region were carried out by drones with normal and jet engines, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a tweet.  
Sarea said Saudi Arabia should stop its “aggression and blockade on Yemen”.

Times Now
Los Angeles: Model Hailey Bieber and singer Justin Bieber are celebrating their one-year anniversary as Mr and Mrs, but they continue to deal with critics and haters who question their marriage.
On September 13, 2018, the couple shocked many when they walked down the aisle in a seemingly impromptu courthouse ceremony in New York.
The surprise move came just two months after they got engaged amid a whirlwind romance they had rekindled not long after Justin and his longtime on-again, off-again Selena Gomez parted ways, reports eonline.com.
"Nobody from the outside really knows what's going on between us. I wake up every morning with this person. I'm the only person that has direct dialogue with this person. This is my relationship. What's so tricky about mental health is that it can be easy to let people convince you of something that's not real," Hailey said in an interview with Vogue Australia.
"When I had hundreds of thousands of comments bombarding me with: 'He's never going to this', 'You're never going to that', 'You'll be divorced by then', you can't help but wonder: 'Does someone see something that I don't see?'" added the 22-year-old.
"It starts to mess with your mind. But the only two people in a relationship are the two people in it. I've been working on retraining my thought process to understand that."

Times Now
Vaani Kapoor has had a rather inconsistent career so far. After making a promising big-screen debut with Yash Raj Films’ Shuddh Desi Romance in 2013, the actress had to wait for three long years for her second Hindi release, Aditya Chopra’s Befikre (2016). The romantic comedy, co-starring Ranveer Singh, tanked at the box office, turning out to be a huge setback for Vaani. It has been three years since then and now, after another long wait, the actress is gearing up for her third Hindi release, War, wherein she will be seen alongside Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff.
During the period Vaani remained absent from the silver screen, a flurry of new actresses made their way into the Hindi film industry making competition tougher than ever before. Janhvi Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan, in particular, emerged as new choices of filmmakers. What Vaani thinks of the competition, she was recently asked in an interview with a leading daily.
She responded saying, “There will always be new entrants in the industry. They are so good and everybody is putting in a lot of effort. I don’t think about who is doing what, but give my 100 per cent to whatever is coming to me. I do my best and nurture it instead of worrying about what project did and did not come to me.”
 
 
War is written by Aditya Chopra and directed by Siddharth Anand. The story revolves around Kabir (Hrithik), an ex Indian Army soldier who has gone rogue, and his former pupil Khalid (Tiger), who has been assigned the job to chase him down.
War, one of the costliest action films to come out of India, is scheduled to hit the screens on October 2 on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti. It will also release in the high-end IMAX format.

Engadget
AI's ability to predict threats to your health could soon include deadly heart conditions.  Researchers at MIT's CSAIL have developed a machine learning system, RiskCardio, that can estimate the risk of death due to cardiovascular issues that block or reduce blood flow.  All it needs is a 15-minute ECG reading -- from there, it gauges the danger based on the sets of consecutive beats in the sample. If the data is captured within 15 minutes of an event, RiskCardio can determine whether or not someone will die within 30 days, or even up to a year later.
The approach is based on the notion that greater variability between heartbeats reflects greater risk.  Scientists trained the machine learning system using historical data for patient outcomes.  If a patient survived, their heartbeats were deemed relatively normal; if a patient died, their heart activity was considered risky.  The ultimate risk score comes by averaging the prediction from each set of consecutive heartbeats.
There's plenty of work to be done, including refining the training data to account for more ages, ethnic backgrounds and genders.  It clearly needs to be accurate when mistakes could have dangerous consequences.  If RiskCardio does enter service, though, it could prove vital to health care.  Doctors could quickly assess a patient's health and decide on an appropriate level of treatment.  CSAIL also hopes it can help understand less-than-clear scenarios by running poorly-labeled data  through the system.

CricTracker
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has accepted Dinesh Karthik’s ‘unconditional apology’ after the keeper violated a clause on his central contract. He was spotted in the Trinbago Knight Riders’ (TKR) dressing room in the team’s first match in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). The game was against the St Kitts and Nevis Patriots at the Queen’s Park Oval in Trinidad.
Karthik was seen sitting beside Brendon McCullum, who was recently appointed as TKR’s head coach. The camera constantly focussed on the Indian cricketer, who was wearing the Knight Riders’ jersey. TKR, captained by new West Indies’ skipper Pollard, won that game by 11 runs.

As far as the 34-year-old’s Karthik’s matter is concerned, an official of the world’s richest cricket board said that the issue is now a ‘closed chapter’ “The BCCI has accepted Dinesh Karthik’s apology and the matter is now a closed chapter,” the official was quoted as saying in The Hindu. Karthik’s contract bars him from being associated with any private league around the globe.
After Karthik’s attendance during the game, the BCCI sent him a show-cause notice, asking him to explain why his contract shouldn’t be cancelled. Thereafter, the Tamil Nadu cricketer made an apology, saying that he went to the TKR dressing room on the insistence of McCullum, who was also appointed as the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL).
McCullum has been a part of KKR since the first season and he retired from all forms of cricket after the 2019 Global T20 Canada. Earlier this year, Jacques Kallis bid adieu to KKR as the head coach after joining the team as a player back in 2011. Simon Katich was also a part of the Knights’ and he has now joined the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) for the upcoming season.
Coming to Karthik, he didn’t have a great campaign in the 2019 World Cup. Thereafter, he played only a solitary game in the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL). The veteran missed out on India’s tour of the West Indies and hasn’t been picked for the T20I series versus South Africa as well.

Google might be about to do pair up two mobile screen-related features, "Edit & Share screenshots" and the AI-powered "What's on my Screen," according to some APK digging by 9 to 5 Google. A new feature called "Smart Screenshots," tucked into the latest version of the Google 10.61 app, brings up an updated toolbar when you take a screenshot. As before, you get edit, share and the option to use your favorite app to send the shot, but there's a new option with the latest version: Lens.
By selecting Lens, you can perform a search, do optical character recognition (OCR) or find visually similar items. The current annotating, cropping and sharing editing tools will likely remain as they are. It's not yet clear whether the new Lens function will work for all screenshots or just those taken in Google Search. However, it seems likely that it will eventually become a replacement for screen search, in much the same way that Lens has taken over from other Google Assistant functions.

Mumbai/Bengaluru: Lee Fixel, the former Tiger Global executive responsible for the firm’s most lucrative India investments, is set to return to his favourite stomping ground as early as next month; this time with his own money, three people directly aware of the matter said.
Fixel is looking to invest around $1 billion through his new fund, Addition, as soon as a non-compete agreement with his former employer expires, the people said, requesting anonymity. He plans to actively look at startups in India and also in South-East Asia, they said.
As the head of Tiger Global’s private equity business, Fixel led the firm’s investment in Flipkart. Walmart later bought a majority stake in Flipkart, giving the US fund its biggest pay-off in India so far.
Fixel was also the architect of Tiger’s other early bets on unicorns such as Ola, Delhivery and Quikr. At Tiger, Fixel was known for his speed of decision-making, often writing a fat cheque just after a brief Skype interview with founders. His aggressive investment approach took peers by surprise, but also earned him global attention.
He has also led lucrative investments in tech giants such as Facebook, LinkedIn and music streaming service Spotify.
“He (Fixel) has set up Addition to invest in tech startups in the areas where Tiger used to invest earlier, and more, and once the non-compete expires in a month or so, he will look at deals actively," said a close associate and partner at a top venture capital firm.
Fixel is already in talks with a few Indian startups to sign cheques. He has held conversations to invest personally in a $24 million seed round at fintech startup Amica Technologies, said two people close to the development, separate from the three cited earlier. Amica has been founded by Jitendra Gupta, a former managing director at Naspers-owned PayU India. Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners are expected to invest as well, The Economic Times reported on 9 August. Gupta declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Fixel confirmed the development, but declined to comment on specific deals and plans. Tiger informed its investors in a letter in March that Fixel might invest his own money and is expected to start a fund.
On Forbes’s “The Midas Touch" list, Fixel appeared six times in the past 12 years, Mint reported in a profile published on 19 March, after he resigned from Tiger. Fixel’s confidant and head of Tiger’s India operations, Kalyan Krishnamurthy, too moved to lead Flipkart, from which Tiger realized $3 billion when Walmart bought a majority stake in Flipkart last year.
Since Fixel announced his departure in March, Tiger’s Indian investments have been headed by Scott Shleifer, under whom Tiger has returned to Indian startups after staying away from fresh bets for over two years. This year Tiger has invested over $400 million in more than 15 startups, including agri-tech startup Ninjacart, home services firm UrbanClap and bookkeeping firm OkCredit, shows a Mint analysis.
“Lee’s non-compete clause with Tiger Global also included that he will not invest in any of the Tiger’s investee companies," said one of the first three people cited earlier. “This is also part of the reason why Tiger has been so aggressive with its investments."
Addition’s possible entry comes along with that of a multitude of investors including private equity funds, pension and wealth funds that want to invest more in Indian startups.
“Investors of all sorts—HNIs (high net worth individuals), PE funds and others—are very keen to invest in Indian tech startups because they have seen exits and money being made, which is a big confidence booster," said Anand Lunia, partner at India Quotient, an early-stage investor. “The underlying parameters needed for a startup to grow, such as internet adoption, UPI and banking reforms are growing very rapidly," he added.

A video of a Pakistani man abusing elderly Indian women in England’s Birmingham, saying they are not welcome in Birmingham or in Jammu and Kashmir is being widely circulated on social media.
In the video, the man can be seen heckling the women, claiming to “fight till the last drop of blood” to move them from Birmingham.
“We will not tolerate India. We will fight till the end...till the last drop of blood. The way India moved us, we will move you from here. You will not stay here,” the man can be heard saying while moving towards them in a hostile manner.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi ended Jammu and Kashmir's special status on 5 August and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.
In retaliation, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations with India and attempted to internationalise the Kashmir issue.
Meanwhile, India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was an “internal matter” and Pakistan has no locus standi in the matter.

Reuters
WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declined to comment on a newspaper report that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had invited him to visit Pyongyang and said conditions were not ready yet for such a visit. 
“The relationship is very good but I don’t want to comment on that,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked whether Kim had invited him to North Korea. 
A South Korean newspaper on Monday cited diplomatic sources as saying Kim had invited him to visit the North Korean capital in a letter sent in August amid stalled denuclearization talks. 
Trump said he would “probably not” be inclined to visit North Korea in the short term, but did not rule out an eventual visit. 
“I would do it ... at some time in a later future, and depending on what happens I’m sure he’ll love coming to the United States also. But, no, I don’t think it’s ready for that. I think we have a ways to go yet,” Trump said. 
Kim, in the letter sent in the third week of August, spoke of his “willingness” for a third summit and extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pyongyang, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source. 
Trump on Aug. 9 said he had received a “very beautiful letter” from Kim. 
But U.S. officials have not said anything about a second letter in August. 
Trump and Kim have met three times since June last year to discuss ways to resolve a crisis over North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, but substantive progress has been scant.  
Their first two meetings were formal summits, the second of which, in Vietnam in February, broke down after they failed to narrow a gap between U.S. demands for North Korean denuclearization and a North Korean demand for relief from sanctions. 
They met for a third time on June 30 in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas and agreed to restart working-level talks but that has not happened. 
Since the June meeting, North Korea has several times tested short-range missiles. 
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. 
An unidentified director-general for U.S. affairs at North Korea’s foreign ministry said on Monday he hoped a “good meeting” with working-level U.S. officials would take place “in a few weeks”. 
But whether a meeting would lead to a “crisis or chance” was up to the United States, the official said, calling for a more flexible approach.  
“The discussion of denuclearization may be possible when threats and hurdles endangering our system security and obstructing our development are clearly removed beyond all doubt,” the official said in a statement carried by North Korea’s official KCNA news agency. 
A spokeswoman for the State Department said the United States welcomed the North Korean commitment to resume negotiations in late September, but it had no meetings to announce. 
“We are prepared to have those discussions at a time and place to be agreed,” she said. The spokeswoman did not respond when asked if the United States was willing to offer any easing of sanctions or security guarantees.  
South Korea’s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, asked about the newspaper report, said there were “detailed explanations about such a letter” but declined to elaborate.  
Kang said it could be “too much to expect” that Trump and Kim would meet before any working-level talks.  
“No agreement was reached between the two leaders in Hanoi even after working-level negotiations,” Kang told a parliamentary panel.  
“For the sake of the success of another summit, their working-level teams should meet and have primary discussions on the outcome of the summit,” Kang said.

Times Now
Washington DC: Hip-hop artist Russell Simmons might be making efforts to make a comeback post the rape accusations but a Manhattan yoga studio believes he is ruining their zen. Simmons has been accused of 12 rape and sexual misconduct cases during the #MeToo movement, reported Fox News.
Recently, Modo Yoga NYC sent an email to him asking to stop visiting their West Village fitness studio. The fashion mogul, who shifted to Bali after misconduct cases, was attending yoga classes at Modo since he was in Manhattan for the past few weeks
"The management invited me, and then said that my presence had 'triggered some members,' " Simmons told The Post from Bali.
"We do not pass judgment, gossip or comment on any of our students . . . However, when we receive complaints from students who are uncomfortable because of another student's alleged conduct outside of Modo, we are put in a difficult position," said the owners of Modo Yoga. "I'm deeply disappointed and hurt by it," Simmons said. "Guilty by accusation, I don't believe is a good way to go forward."

India.com
Actor Deepika Padukone took the opportunity to speak about mental health and start a conversation about depression. She delivered her first lecture on behalf of her foundation Live, Love Laugh in Delhi on Sunday. The actor talked about the stigma related to the conversation about mental health and how it’s high time to have more awareness about the same.
“I think the conversation has opened up (on mental health). I don’t think there’s as much stigma as there used to be four years ago. But we certainly have a long way to go in terms of creating more awareness. I think that’s where we need to keep the conversation alive,” Deepika, who looked stunning in a pristine white ensemble paired with shimmery dangling earrings and minimal make-up, said at the event.
One of the highest-paid actor of India, Deepika, who started her career with Om Shanti Om over a decade ago, has set up a foundation to create awareness on mental health named ‘The Live Love Laugh Foundation’ in 2015, which creates awareness about stress, anxiety and depression.
From opening about her struggles to now, the Piku star describes her journey as “incredible.”

“It’s been an incredible journey since we developed our foundation. .. it’s been 4 years now and today we launch our first lecture series and I think we have come a long way and in all certainty, we have a long way to go. But I think as far as the conversation around mental health is concerned I think we have come a long way,” she said.
Deepika added: “I think media has had a huge role in that in opening up the conversation in various ways whether its interviews, write-ups and articles… but we certainly have a long way to go and that’s why we have the lecture series today.”
The maiden lecture was delivered by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Padma Shree awardee Siddhartha Mukherjee. The event was graced by Deepika’s parents Prakash Padukone and Ujjala, sister Anisha Padukone, actress Sharmila Tagore, key stakeholders and decision-makers from different sectors.

Instagram is one of the most popular photo-sharing apps in the world. Facebook-owned Instagram is said to be working on a new feature which will allow users to share videos which will be similar to TikTok videos. According to reports, Instagram will call the new feature ‘Clip’. In the new feature, the users will be able to shoot short videos of themselves with music in the background. Users will also be able to adjust the timer of all the videos that they shoot which is very similar to TikTok videos. It looks like Instagram is copying a popular feature once again to make the app even more engaging. The Facebook-owned company had taken a leaf out of popular photo-sharing app Snapchat’s book when they introduced the story option on Instagram.
Instagram is making sure that they do everything to get the top spot in terms of downloads. The new feature could help them reach new heights and help them gain new users as well in the process.
TikTok was launched back in 2014 by Alex Zhu and Luyu Yang. The owners of the application were Chinese entrepreneurs who went on to acquire Musical.ly for $1 billion which was one of the main competitors for TikTok. ByteDance is the parent company of TikTok which recently crossed the 1 billion mark in downloads across the globe. It is one of the most downloaded apps in the iOS app store and Google play store at the moment.
However, TikTok has had its share of controversies as the popular application was banned in India in April by the Madras High Court. It was said that the app was not following guidelines which led to children viewing inappropriate content. Later that month the ban was lifted and TikTok was ordered to follow a strict guideline which was important for the safety of its users.

		             MUMBAI :
Early stage investor Kae Capital is in talks to raise its third venture capital fund of up to $60 million, said two people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.
This fund would be slightly bigger than its second fund of $53 million in 2017 as its seed stage cheque sizes have become larger and the fund is seeking more capital to be able to invest across multiple rounds.
Kae Capital was founded by Sasha Mirchandani, one of India’s earliest startup investors, and founder of the Mumbai Angels network of angel investors. It raised a first fund of $25 million, and invested in firms such as online pharmacy 1mg, and omnichannel shopping startup Fynd. From its second fund, its investments include logistics startup Freightwalla and Zetwerk, a business-to-business platform for custom manufacturing.
Kae Capital is working with a Mumbai-based wealth management firm to market the fund and attract limited partners (LPs), investors in a venture capital fund, said the people mentioned above. Its current LPs include Small Industries Development Bank of India, MakeMyTrip founder Deep Kalra, and Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan.
Before starting Kae Capital, Mirchandani had invested in his personal capacity in companies such as Myntra, the fashion portal sold to Flipkart in 2014, ad-tech company InMobi, and data analytics firm Fractal Analytics, which has raised $200 million in its last funding round in January this year from private equity firm Apax Partners.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: BJP MP Subramanian Swamy, who has often criticized the current government’s economic policies, believes only individuals with a solid grounding in the field of macroeconomics can pull the economy out of its current tailspin. 
Swamy believes that the government today needs a crisis management team of experienced politicians and professional but politically-savvy economists who are rooted in Indian ethos and not compliant to institutions like the IMF and the World Bank.
“Today, the economy suffers from clueless economic stewardship, cloaked in spin, and media management, while the economy is debilitated by serious multiple structural flaws that make this current slowdown unlike any other we have experienced in India since 1947,” he writes in his book titled, ‘Reset: Regaining India’s Economic Legacy’.
He also believes that many members of government subcommittees have no formal training in quantitative economic logic to be applied in a macroeconomic framework. 
Swamy also said that as of now, he believes, the Modi government does not the contingency prescriptions ready to address the tailspin being experienced by the Indian economy. 
Swamy, however, is hopeful that India will come out successful, as it has in all crises in the past 72 years.

The New Indian Express
NEW DELHI: India will soon have 1,023 new fast-track special courts for speedy trial of over 1.66 lakh pending cases of crime against women and children. The proposal has been sent by the Union government, which estimates that each of these special courts is likely to dispose of at least 165 such cases per year.
Out of the 1,023 fast-track special courts (FTSCs), 389 courts, according to a Supreme Court direction, will exclusively handle cases registered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, according to a note by the Department of Justice under Union Law Ministry.
The remaining 634 FTSCs will deal with either rape or both rape and POCSO Act cases depending upon the pendency and requirement. 
“Each fast-track special court is expected to dispose of 41-42 cases each quarter,” stated the proposal.
According to official data with the Department of Justice, a total of 1,66,882 cases of rape and those under POCSO Act are pending trial in various courts in the country.
There are 389 districts in the country where the number of pending cases under the POCSO Act exceeds 100.
Therefore, as per the apex court directives, each such district will have one exclusive POCSO court, which will try no other cases, the note said.
The process of setting up of more FTSCs is likely to begin on October 2, the Law Ministry had earlier said. 
In a letter to the Cabinet Secretariat on August 8, the Department of Justice had said after the recommendation of the expenditure finance committee on July 11 and approval of the law minister, the proposal has been forwarded to the finance minister for approval.
The latest note of the Law Ministry says that “other connected actions are being taken as setting up of fast-track special courts is planned to start from 02nd October 2019.”

The Quint
One of India's most consistent sportspersons, Pankaj Advani, on Sunday, 15 September, increased his tally of world titles to 22 by winning a fourth straight final in the 150-up format at the IBSF World Billiards Championship in Myanmar.
The 34-year-old has brought home a world trophy every year ever since returning from a professional stint in the UK in 2014.
In the short format of billiards, this is Advani's fifth title in the last six years.
"It's such a touch-and-go format and so unpredictable that winning this four years on the trot and five out of the last six is extremely special," said the champion athlete.
In a repeat of last year's final against local favourite Nay Thway Oo, Advani re-enacted the one-sided match with the same eventual outcome as well as identical scorelines of 6-2.
"This is the 150 points format in Billiards which is a shorter format and it is unpredictable because anybody can win on that particular day and to maintain consistency in this short format is an incredible feeling (after winning title) for last four years," he told PTI.
From the word go, Advani was in full flow. The gifted Indian was leading 3-0 at the halfway mark with the help of fluent breaks comprising of 145, 89 and 127, while Nay Thway Oo was yet to open his account.
After pulling one back with breaks of 63 and 62, Oo was forced to watch Advani continue to extend the lead. He executed with flair as his sheer brilliance was on display, wowing the Myanmar crowd as they couldn't help but appreciate his brilliant billiards.
Advani secured the next two frames which included a 150 unfinished break. He scored a 74 break and shortly after that closed out the match.
Oo was completely subdued by his accomplished opponent and had to settle for a silver medal for the second time in a row.
With another trophy in the bag, Advani extends his remarkable run of winning a global crown since 2003. The Bengaluru-based cueist has won more world titles in his sport than anyone else.
Advani said winning trophies early in his career did wonders for his mindset.
"I feel the opposition has been great and will be better in years to come with a lot more younger players coming, so to be able to maintain this position and repeat this feats is going to be a but then that's what excites me and that is what the sport is all about," he said.
On winning a staggering 22nd world title, Advani added, "Every time I participate in a world championship, one thing is clear - my motivation to excel has not diminished. This win a testament to the fact that my hunger and fire are both well and truly alive."
Advani have to adjust to snooker in less than 24 hours as he competes in the IBSF World Six-Red Snooker and the World Team Snooker Championships.
Pankaj Advani (India) defeated Nay Thway Oo (Myanmar) 6-2 150(145)-4, 151(89)-66, 150(127)-50(50), 7-150(63,62), 151(50)-69(50), 150(150)-0, 133(64)-150(105), 150(74)-75(63).

Cricket Country
The grace and flamboyance with which Quinton de Kock bats reminds Gautam Gambhir of the great Brian Lara and Sangakkara, the former India opener wrote in his column for the Times of India Saturday. Gambhir, who retired from international cricket last December, admitted de Kock’s style is the type which he wouldn’t have mind implementing in his own game during his playing days.
ALSO READ: Five South Africa players to watch out for
As de Kock gets ready to lead South Africa for the first time in T20Is, a lot rides on how he goes about in this series. With Faf du Plessis rested, De Kock is most likely candidate to take over the reins, one who is expected to take the lead the team to Australia next year for the T20 World Cup.
Team Director Enoch Nkwe recently said that it’s about time South Africa look beyond du Plessis. The key is to blood youngsters going into the T20 World Cup and as de Kock gears up to lead a fairly young side in India following their World Cup debacle, his stiff test starts right away. South Africa are hurting and de Kock would be keen eager to making his IPL experience count against one of the toughest teams to beat on their home turf.
“In the context of South Africa’s tour of India, the visitors may relate to this as this is their first international engagement after a forgetful World Cup campaign. I like Quinton de Kock. He is one of those gorgeous left-handers which I always aspired to be but could never be. In full flow, he reminds me of Kumara Sangakkara and Brian Lara. Hopefully, he delivers as a captain but not at the cost of curtailing fluidity of his batting,” Gambhir said.
The former India opener feels India would fancy playing against a relatively low-on-experience side on their home turf. India are yet to win an T20I against South Africa at home, their last meeting ending in the Proteas beating them 2-0 in 2015. The three-match series opener will take place on Sunday in Dharamsala, where South Africa beat India the last time after they chased down 200.
Gambhir however believes that time with the likes of promising youngsters such as Manish Pandey and Shreyas Iyer in the side, India are better equipped and that the series also gives the opportunity to these young talents an opportunity to cement their place in the team, keeping an eye of the T20 World Cup in Australia next year.
“India will be licking their lips at the idea of taking on a young, work-in-progress opposition. Dharamsala is not a very big arena. And being at the higher altitude, the science guys tell me that the ball travels faster because the air is thin. All this means there will be plenty of boundaries if the pitch is good for batting,” Gambhir reckoned.
“It is another opportunity for young Indian batsmen to cement their place in the side. Manish Pandey looks much younger than his age of 29. Shreyas Iyer explained enough in the West Indies that he is a great deal more than the ‘South Bombay’ swag. KL Rahul is a force in white-ball format. Rishabh Pant is always exciting but he has to watch his back as my favourite Sanju Samson is throwing some serious challenges at him. It is an exciting series as there are a lot of individual battles going on considering the T20 World Cup next year.”

Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States was “locked and loaded” for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities, after a senior U.S. administration official said Iran was to blame. 
Trump also authorized the use of the U.S. emergency oil stockpile to ensure stable supplies after the attack, which shut 5% of world production and sent crude prices soaring more than 19% in early trade on Monday, before moderating to show a 10% gain. 
There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!” Trump said on Twitter. 
Earlier in the day, a senior U.S. official told reporters that evidence from the attack, which hit the world’s biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it, instead of the Yemeni Houthi group that had claimed responsibility. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim rival Iran. 
“Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” Pompeo said. 
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the U.S. allegations that it was responsible was “pointless”. A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned the Islamic Republic was ready for “full-fledged” war. 
“All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometres around Iran are within the range of our missiles,” the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying. 
Tensions between Washington and Tehran were already running high because of a long-running dispute between the two nations over Iran’s nuclear program that led the United States to impose sweeping sanctions. 
Oil prices surged as much as 19% in early Asian trade on Monday on worries over global supply and soaring tensions in the Middle East.  
Brent crude posted its biggest intra-day percentage gain since the start of the Gulf War in 1991. 
State oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack on Saturday had cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day. 
The U.S. official, who asked not to be named, said on Sunday there were 19 points of impact in the attack on Saudi facilities and evidence showed the launch area was west-northwest of the targets - not south from Yemen. 
The official added that Saudi officials indicated they had seen signs that cruise missiles were used in the attack, which is inconsistent with the Iran-aligned Houthi group’s claim that it conducted the attack with 10 drones. 
“There’s no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there’s no escaping it. There’s no other candidate,” the official told reporters.      
Riyadh has accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil-pumping stations and the Shaybah oil field, charges that Tehran denies, but has not blamed anyone for Saturday’s strike. Riyadh also says Tehran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny. 
Richard Nephew, a program director at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said if Iran was responsible for the attack, it may be as retribution for U.S. sanctions.

The co-creators of Silicon Valley are developing a series on the origins of Match.com, according to Variety. John Altschuler and David Krinsky are reportedly adapting a book entitled The Players Ball: A Genius, a Con Man, and the Secret History of the Internet's Rise for the small screen. 
Written by David Kushner, the book tells the story of how Gary Kremen created what became the first online dating site using a $2,500 loan. It also tackles Kremen's decade-long battle with Stephen Michael Cohen, who stole the rights to sex.com -- a domain he purchased shortly after buying Match.com with the belief that, as the book's synopsis says, "the combination of love and sex would help propel the internet into the mainstream."
Kushner, the book's author, will serve as executive producer for the series. TBS has reportedly ordered a script from the show's pilot, but it'll likely take a while before we hear about a release date.

Eden Hazard 'p***** off' team-mate Thibaut Courtois after supposedly losing possession and failing to score on his Real Madrid debut.  
Madrid raced into a 3-0 half-time lead against Levante thanks to a Karim Benzema double and a goal from Casemiro. 
Casemiro was replaced by Hazard after an hour as the visitors threatened to cause an upset at the Bernabeu, scoring two goals in the second half.

Minutes: 30
Touches: 29 
Dribbles: 1
Shots: 2
Hazard, who only recently recovered from a thigh injury sustained in pre-season, failed to impress his former Chelsea colleague Courtois though.
Speaking after the game, Courtois told Movistar: 'He almost scored a goal with what he did (in attack). He has a lot of pace with the ball, it's what he does.
'But I got a little p***** off with him because he lost the ball twice.' 
Thibaut Courtois says he was 'p***** off' by his compatriot's first performance at the Bernabeu
The goalkeeper added: 'We were thinking of a clean sheet at half-time. Sometimes we have to continue in the same way, but we didn't do that after the break.
'It became 3-1 and then 3-2 and we knew we couldn't drop points again. In the end, I was able to make the stop to save us.
'If we kept going like in the first half, with all due respect, we would have won 5-0 or 6-0.
'We played our best 45 minutes of the year, but this is football. Levante changed their system and we lacked precision with our passing.'
The result moved Madrid up to fourth in the early La Liga standings, having won two and drawn two of their opening four matches.

In its first half-decade of existence, PopSocket has grown into one of the most popular — and imitated — smartphone accessories on the market. In 2018 alone, the company generated $90 million in profit. Not too bad for a little Colorado-based upstart. 
So, where does an utterly dominant accessory maker go from here? Beverages, naturally. Delish was the first to report the existence of the PopThirst line. You may well have missed it in the wake of this week’s iPhone news. I was on a plane with limited Wi-Fi access, I swear. Whatever the case, the weird little retractable phone holder that has captured the world’s imagination $15 at a time is now headed for the lucrative field of refreshments. 
It’s an odd evolution of the brand, to be sure. But why not strike while the iron (and coffee) is hot? I know plenty of people who swear by the phone accessory, and the pop-out gripper looks to fit pretty well on a matching koozie for hot and cold beverages, alike. Pop it on a can of La Croix to find yourself on the cutting edge of the 2016 zeitgeist. 
The cupholders feature a wide range of styles, from leopard print to camo. They’re up for pre-order on PopSocket’s page for $15 a pop. They’ll go on sale September 15.

The New Indian Express
PATNA: Former Union minister of state for HRD and national president of RLSP Upendra Kushwaha, on Thursday, said that the people of Bihar have virtually rejected Nitish Kumar because of his failure in providing good governance.
Kushwaha was once considered one of the closest political friends of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. Speaking at a media interface with the leaders of grand alliance's all other allies on Sunday, Kushwaha lambasted Kumar for its failure to maintain Bihar's law and order
"The Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance)in Bihar is united and will remain so in future," he said, adding that country is passing through a very dangerous phase of chaos under the prime ministership of Narendra Modi.
"Nitish Kumar in Bihar has failed to deliver and stand true to the expectations of people. In the state Assembly elections, which are scheduled to be held in 2020, Kumar's JDU and the BJP will be shown the exit door," he added.
He said on October 12, the grand alliance will observe a Lohia day. The presser was attended by Congress state President Madan Mohan Jha and other leaders of allies but RJD's Tejashwi Yadav and HAM's Jitan Ram Manjhi were conspicuous by their absence.

Saudi Aramco has told one Indian refinery there will be no immediate impact on oil supplies as it will deliver crude from other sources and had adequate inventory, a source with the refinery said on Sunday.
Aramco has lost half of its production capacity after attacks on its facilities on Saturday and it remains unclear how long it will take the company to fix the damage. 
State energy producer lost about 5.7 million barrels per day of output after 10 unmanned aerial vehicles on Saturday struck the world’s biggest crude-processing facility in Abqaiq and the kingdom’s second-biggest oil field in Khurais, the company said.
The attack was the biggest on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure since Iraq’s Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles into the kingdom during the first Gulf War. The damage highlights the vulnerability of the Saudi industry that supplies 10% of the world’s crude oil. The kingdom’s benchmark stock index tumbled as much as 3.1% on Sunday in Riyadh.

 Farhan Saeed, a former member of Pakistan's popular band Jal, has slammed Salim Merchant for copying his song "Roiyaan". However, the Indian singer-composer called it a "mere coincidence".

"Someone just sent me @salim_merchant song HAREYA, which is a total copy of my song ROIYAAN. I wonder they have the audacity to call themselves artists when they steal someone's work. Karna hi hai to pooch ke kuro aur ager poochna nahin hai to at least acha to kuro! #stopstealing," Farhan tweeted on September 14.

Farhan I just heard your song. It’s a mere coincidence that the chorus of Haareya is like your song. To be honest I’ve never heard it before. It happens many a times when notes have a natural progression from each other. @Sulaiman & I have a track record of never plagiarising.



@salim_merchant if you say so! Another co incidence is we have the same lyricist! Anyway good luck !



Why don’t you check with him!

Times Now
Veteran actress Shabana Azmi on Saturday took to social media and treated fans to a gem of a throwback photograph. Sharing a still from her film Mandi, the cinema veteran pointed out the similarities between the looks of her friend and colleague Soni Razdan and Alia Bhatt. 
In the still shared, we see Razdan and Smita Patil sharing the screen space with Azmi. While Azmi was in the centre, Razdan and Patil stood beside her.
Azmi captioned her photograph as, "#Alia Bhatt looks exactly like her mother #Soni Razdan . Here is proof. Still from #Mandi."
Directed by Shyam Benegal, Mandi had its theatrical release back in 1983. The satirical comedy that revolves around politics and prostitution co-starred Naseeruddin Shah, Neena Gupta, Annu Kapoor and Kulbhushan Kharbanda alongside Razdan, Azmi, and Patil. 
 
 
Soon after Azmi posted the throwback moment, fans began to comment on how similar the mother-daughter duo look. Amidst the many fans that dropped comments on Azmi's post, actress Richa Chadha, too, had something special to say.
Showering the mother-daughter with praise, Richa adorably commented, "Both are beautiful and spectacularly talented ."

Interestingly, Razdan, too, had posted a similar still from their film back in May this year. She had then captioned her photo as, "Memories of MANDI Women In Indian Cinema- #SoniRazdan, #ShabanaAzmi and #SmitaPatil in #ShyamBenegal’s Mandi (1983)."
 
 
On the film front, while Azmi has come on board for Sheer Khurma, co-starring Swara Bhasker and Divya Dutta, Razdan last graced the big screen in No Fathers In Kashmir. Meanwhile, Alia, who was last seen in Abhishek Varman's period drama Kalank has started the prep of Takht. Directed by Karan Johar, the film co-stars Ranveer Singh, Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi Pednekar, Anil Kapoor and Janhvi Kapoor in key roles.

Nobel Peace Prize winner and Pakistani education rights activist Malala Yousafzai has urged the UN to work towards peace in Kashmir and help children in the Valley to go back to school.
Taking to Twitter, Malala, 22, said she was deeply concerned about reports that Kashmiri students “have not been able to attend schools for more than 40 days”, and “about girls who are afraid to leave their homes”.
“I am asking leaders, at UNGA and beyond, to work towards peace in Kashmir, listen to Kashmiri voices and help children go safely back to school,” the youngest-ever Nobel Laureate tweeted on Saturday, 14 September.

Her remarks drew sharp criticism from Indian members of the Twitterati who questioned her silence on the plight of the girls belonging to the minority community in Pakistan.
“Pakistan doesn’t react to how it’s perceived in the world, carries forward their agenda and how Malala is helping run that agenda on Kashmir in the garb of her ‘concern’ for Kashmiri girls but am loving the meltdown Indians are having on behalf of Malala. So touching,” Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi said in a tweet.
BJP leader Shobha Karandlaje too tweeted and said that the nobel laureate should spend some time with the minorities of her own country.
Normal life has remained affected in Kashmir since August 5 when India abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution, revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Most shops and schools remain shut and public transport has gone off the roads in the Valley.

Senior journalist Barkha Dutt was also among the people who said that Malala was giving into Pakistan’s ‘cliched narrative’.
The efforts of the state government to reopen schools have not borne any fruit as parents continue to keep the kids at home due to apprehensions about their safety.
Posters have appeared in Srinagar warning people to keep their children away from schools after the Centre abrogated Jammu and Kashmir's special status last month.
"The terrorists want the public to remain illiterate so that they can control their mind," said Farooq Khan, the advisor to Governor Satya Pal Malik.
Malala, the famed human rights activist, was shot by the Taliban gunman in December 2012 for her campaign on girls' education in the Swat Valley in northeastern Pakistan.
The Taliban, who are opposed to the education of girls, have destroyed hundreds of schools in Pakistan.
At the age of 17, Malala became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, when she shared the coveted honour with India's social activist Kailash Satyarthi.

The Financial Express
Minister of State for Labour and Employment Santosh Kumar Gangwar on Saturday sparked controversy by saying that there was no dearth of jobs in the country and that people in North India were not getting jobs because they were not skilled enough. The minister later clarified on his statement after backlash from opposition leaders.
“There is no dearth of jobs in the country. The recruiters who come to north India often complain that they are unable to find the desired quality in candidates required for the position they are hiring for (Desh mein rozgaar ki kami nahi hai. Humare Uttar Bharat mein jo recruitment karne aate hain is baat ka sawaal karte hain ki jis padd ke liye hum rakh rahe hain uski quality ka vyakti humein kum milta hai),” Gangwar observed during a press conference in his constituency.
Gangwar’s statement on unemployment drawn sharp criticism from Opposition parties. Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the government of insulting the north Indians by saying that recruiters complain of the paucity of “quality people” in this part of the country for the posts they wish to fill. Gandhi also held the government responsible for the current slowdown in the economy.
“Mr Minister, it has been more than five years for your government. There is no job creation. Whatever jobs were there, they have been snatched due to the economic slowdown brought by the government. You want to escape by insulting North Indians,” said the Congress leader in a tweet.
Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh accused the BJP of hiding the shortcomings of its government at the Centre by saying that the youth is unemployed due to lack of merit. “BJP government minister Santosh Gangwar said that our youth is unemployed because they do not have merit. It is just a way to hide the shortcomings of their government. If anywhere there is a lack of merit then it is only in the BJP government,” he said.
Under attack, the minister got into the damage control mode and clarified that he meant that there was lack of skills for which government has focused on training candidates according to the job requirement through skill development programmes. “What I said had a different context that there was lack of skills and government has opened skill ministry so children can be trained as per job requirement,” the Bareilly MP said.
In May this year, the government data showed that India’s unemployment rate stood at a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent in the financial year 2017-18. The government had contended that the figure was not comparable with that of past years as it instated new metrics to arrive at the final data.

The New Indian Express
CHANDIGARH: Haryana will implement a citizens’ list along the lines of the recently published National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam to check illegal immigration, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said.
Besides this, he said, a Law Commission is also being considered for the state. “Justice Bhalla had headed the Haryana Human Rights Commission besides holding various other positions. These days, he is working on NRC. I also said that we shall implement NRC in Haryana and sought his cooperation on how to implement it. He has also suggested that Haryana should also have a Law Commission. We shall examine that too and if people get benefitted with this, we shall also constitute one in the state,” Khattar told the media after meeting with Justice (retired) HS Bhalla and former Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba.

Khattar, however, did not provide details regarding how the exercise will be done. “Justice Bhalla will visit Assam soon. I said that we will implement NRC in Haryana and have sought Bhalla ji’s support and suggestion,” he told reporters.
“The state government is working on a fast pace on family identity card and its data would also be used in the National Register of Citizens (NRC).”

While the NRC pitch comes about a month ahead of the Haryana election, Khattar’s statement is in consonance with Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s assertion of nationwide NRC for expelling out illegal immigrants from the country. 
A social audit system would also be implemented in Haryana so that the audit of development work could be done by the intellectuals people of the society, the Haryana chief minister said.   
For this purpose, a separate voluntary department would also be formed in the coming days, Khattar added.

Times Now
Kolkata: In a bizarre incident, a Kolkata-Agartala Air India flight was delayed after a swarm of bees attacked the aircraft on the runway at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata on Sunday. 
The Air India flight - AI 743 – was delayed for almost two hours after a swarm of bees was noticed in front of the cockpit window when the aircraft was taxing towards the main runway. 
136 passengers and crew members were on board the Airbus A319 which was scheduled to take off from Kolkata for Agartala at 9:40 am today. 
Mustafa Jabbar, Bangladesh’s Minister of Post and Telecommunication and Information Technology, was reportedly one of the passengers on board the flight. 
However, the pilots noticed the bees in front of the aircraft when it was being taken to the main runway for departure. The pilots immediately informed the Air Traffic Control (ATC) about the situation. 
The aircraft was brought to a standstill as further movement could have damaged the plane and even harmed the passengers if the bees would have entered the aircraft through its engines, an Air India spokesperson was quoted as saying by a news agency. 
Meanwhile, the fire department had to use water jets to remove the bees from the windowpane of the cockpit.
Upon further investigation, officials found that the bees had not entered the aircraft and that the plane had not been damaged in the incident. 
The flight eventually left for Agartala around 12:45 pm.
Incidentally, prior to the incident, the flight had been delayed due to a technical snag.

MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday praised Pakistan saying that he received a very warm welcome on his visit to the neighbouring country and added that people are happy in the Islamic nation as against the common belief in India.
He said BJP-led central government was spreading fake propaganda against Pakistan for political gains.
"People here say Pakistanis are facing injustice and are unhappy but it is not true. Such statements are being made only for political gains without understanding the actual situation in Pakistan," he said here.

The former Union Minister said that he had visited Pakistan on several occasions where he was accorded hospitality as "Pakistanis believe that even if they can't go to India to meet their relatives, they treat an Indian as their relatives".
Tensions prevail between India and Pakistan ever since the Pulwama terror attack in February in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed. India had hit back at Pakistan with an airstrike in Balakot.
It heightened following the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, with Pakistan unsuccessfully approaching the global community to seek their support on the matter. Incidents of ceasefire violations, attempted infiltration through the borders of Jammu and Kashmir have only added to the tensions.
Frustrated with the snub from the international community over the nullification of Article 370, which India described as "internal matter", Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has even threatened India with nuclear war over the situation in Kashmir.

"He should realise the limitations of exaggeration. India has existed. We call it Bharatvarsha; it is Sanatan, Anadi, Anant and a great civilisation. Let the RSS not take credit for everything," he added.

Reuters
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to the comic book character The Incredible Hulk in a newspaper interview where he stressed his determination to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31. 
The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported that Johnson said he would find a way to circumvent a recent parliament vote ordering him to delay Brexit rather than take Britain out of the EU without a transition deal. 
“The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,” Johnson was quoted as saying. “Hulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be - and that is the case for this country. We will come out on October 31.” 
Britain’s parliament has repeatedly rejected the exit deal Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May negotiated with the EU, and this month rejected leaving without a deal - angering many  Britons who voted to leave the bloc more than three years ago. 
Johnson wants to harness that anger to win a majority in an early national election, but his efforts to call one have so far been thwarted by opposition parties who want to first ensure Britain cannot leave the EU without a deal on Oct. 31. 
The Liberal Democrats party, which has 18 seats in Britain’s 650-seat parliament, on Sunday made its bid for the votes of those who want remain in the EU, toughening its anti-Brexit stance to say it would stop the exit process if it won power in an election, and would reject any Brexit deal Johnson struck. 
“If people put into government as a majority government, the ‘Stop Brexit’ party, then stopping Brexit is exactly what people will get,” party leader Jo Swinson said. 
Johnson has said he wants to negotiate a new deal that does not involve a ‘backstop’, which would potentially tie Britain against its will to EU rules after it leaves in order to avoid checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
The EU has so far insisted on the backstop, and Britain has not presented any detailed alternative. 
Nonetheless, Johnson said he was “very confident” ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday. 
“There’s a very, very good conversation going on about how to address the issues of the Northern Irish border. A huge amount of progress is being made,” Johnson told the Mail on Sunday, without giving details. 
The opposition Labour Party called for more details on what Johnson was proposing. 
Johnson drew parallels between Britain’s situation in Brexit talks and the frustrations felt by fictional scientist Bruce Banner, who when enraged turned into the super-strong Incredible Hulk, frequently leaving behind a trail of destruction. 
“Banner might be bound in manacles, but when provoked he would explode out of them,” he said. 
The Sunday Times reported that Johnson’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings had raised the idea of suspending parliament for a second time. Parliament is currently suspended until Oct. 14 - a decision which is being challenged in the courts by those who say it is an attempt to block debate on Brexit. 
On Saturday, former Conservative minister Sam Gyimah said he was switching to the pro-EU Liberal Democrat party in protest at Johnson’s Brexit policies and political style, and Swinson said she believed she could win an election. 
But, polling suggests the Liberal Democrats, who in the party’s modern form have never won more than 62 seats at an election, are unlikely to find themselves in a position to stop Brexit outright. 
Polls published late on Saturday painted a conflicting picture of the Conservative Party’s political fortunes under Johnson. 
A poll conducted by Opinium for the Observer newspaper showed Conservative support rose to 37% from 35% over the past week, while Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour held at 25% and Liberal Democrat support dropped to 16% from 17%. Support for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party remained at 13%. 
However, a separate poll by ComRes for the Sunday Express put Conservative support at just 28%, down from 30% and only a shade ahead of Labour at 27%. 
ComRes said just 12% of the more than 2,000 people it survey thought Britain’s parliament could be trusted to do the right thing for the country.

Times Now
Veteran music composer Vanraj Bhatia, who has worked on films like 36 Chowringhee Lane, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, Manthan, Junoon, Ankur and Bhumika among others, is living a tough life. At 92, the composer is reportedly living isolated and penniless in his Mumbai house. He has Sujit Kamti, his domestic help, to assist him with house chores and take care of his health. 
According to a recent report, the composer had a "severe hearing loss" and has "extended bouts of memory lapses." He also suffers from severe knee pain and needs assistance in walking from one room to another. Not being able to afford regular medical check-ups, a specific illness hasn't yet been diagnosed, house help informed Pune Mirror. 
To make ends meet, British crockery at his residence has been put up on sale. When a reporter from the publication reached his house, the composer was surprised to have a visitor. 
In the said report, the composer said, "I have no money, not one rupee left in my bank account." While his close friends are trying to raise money to help him, the composer is unaware of their efforts. 
In his illustrious career, the stalwart composer has collaborated with the likes of Shyam Benegal and Aparna Sen among others. 
Filmmaker Shyam Benegal informed the portal that the National Award-winning music composer has "unfortunately painted himself into a corner over time." Opening up about Bhatia's situation, he shared how he doesn't have friends who can match his "intelligence, sense of humour and world view". 
Things reportedly worsened after his pet cat Papsoo passed away in a car accident. The house help informed the publication that Bhatia went silent after his cat's demise. But to help with medical expenses and his upkeep, his close friends and admirers are trying to raise money.

India is our nation" and sang patriotic songs during the rally.The Kashmiri Pandits told personal stories of how they were driven out of their ancestral homeland back in 1989-1990 due to militancy."Back in 1990, one day my father-in-law came home and told us we have to leave within 15 minutes. Imagine leaving your whole life behind you and pack your belongings in a couple of suitcases within 15 minutes, never to return home. That was just the beginning of a long struggle ahead," said a Kashmiri Pandit.A similar rally was earlier held in Washington DC by Kashmiri Pandits from various parts of the United States, during which they had raised slogans in support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking the "bold and historic step".

Only three Australian batsmen are certain to start the summer Test series against Pakistan, according to former skipper Ricky Ponting, with David Warner among them. Ponting, who has been a sounding board for coach Justin Langer in recent months, unsurprisingly nominated the in-form Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne as the other two.

That leaves holes to fill and Australia’s greatest run scorer said he would like to see young prospect Will Pucovski, who has battled mental health issues, given a debut in the first Test at the Gabba on November 12.

“Warner’s going to be a lock,” Ponting told cricket.com.au, despite the opener having a miserable Ashes tour where he has struggled to get into double digits. “I don’t care if he gets another duck in the second innings of this Test match (at the Oval), he’s going to be a lock for the Australian summer. Marnus is an absolute lock. Smith’s a lock.
“(There are) still question marks around the guys in the middle, (Matthew) Wade and (Travis) Head,” he added. “(Opener Marcus) Harris has looked tested against good quality fast bowling in this series.”
Australia have chopped and changed their top and middle order against England, with Usman Khawaja and Cameron Bancroft among those dropped after failing to fire. Their lack of form could open the door to Joe Burns and Kurtis Patterson, who were controversially left out of the squad for England despite making centuries in their last home Test against Sri Lanka.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey could also get a look in, although Ponting said Tim Paine should continue as captain during the summer Tests against Pakistan and New Zealand.
“With so many gaps like that, I’d like to see somebody like Pucovski get an opportunity,” he added. “Everyone’s talked about him for a long time. A couple of years before the next Ashes series you want to try and blood someone in that No.6 role and he’d be the obvious candidate.”
The 21-year-old smashed a superb 243 for Victoria against Western Australia last season, which saw him parachuted into the national setup for two Tests against Sri Lanka. He was overlooked for the first one in Brisbane and again missed out on selection for the second in Canberra before being released to deal with mental health issues. He had suffered similar problems in the past.

If you tend to watch YouTube using the Leanback interface on a home theater PC, you might have to scrounge for an alternative. YouTube is warning visitors to the Leanback web portal that this version "will be going away soon." This won't preclude you from watching YouTube, of course, but you'll have to turn to another device f you want an interface that's easier to navigate from across the living room.
We've asked YouTube for comment.
It's not clear at this stage why YouTube might pull the web app. Android Police speculated that this could be an attempt to discourage device makers from circumventing its app through a browser. However, it could also just be a matter of shifting company resources as the web version becomes less and less necessary. Many people now have access to smart TVs, consoles and media hubs with a largely identical interface. In those cases, the web version is redundant. This could help YouTube pour more effort into native apps.
Update 9/16 1:38PM ET: YouTube declined to share more beyond confirming the shutdown, but a Variety source said the interface will shut down on October 2nd.

TechCrunch
While Apple and Microsoft strain to sell augmented reality as the next major computing platform, many of the startups aiming to beat them to the punch are crashing and burning.
Daqri, which built enterprise-grade AR headsets, has shuttered its HQ, laid off many of its employees and is selling off assets ahead of a shutdown, former employees and sources close to the company tell TechCrunch.
In an email obtained by TechCrunch, the nearly 10-year-old company told its customers that it was pursuing an asset sale and was shutting down its cloud and smart-glasses hardware platforms by the end of September.
“I think the large majority of people who worked [at Daqri] are sad to see it closing down,” a former employee told TechCrunch. “[I] wish the end result was different.”
The company’s 18,000+ square foot Los Angeles headquarters (above) is currently listed as “available” by real estate firm Newmark Knight Frank. The company’s Sunnyvale offices appear to have been shuttered sometime prior to 2019.
The company’s 18,000+ square foot Los Angeles headquarters (above) is currently listed as “available” by real estate firm Newmark Knight Frank. The company’s Sunnyvale offices appear to have been shuttered sometime prior to 2019.
Daqri’s shutdown is only the latest among heavily funded augmented reality startups seeking to court enterprise customers.
Earlier this year, Osterhout Design Group unloaded its AR glasses patents after acquisition talks with Magic Leap, Facebook and others stalled. Meta, an AR headset startup that raised $73 million from VCs, including Tencent, also sold its assets earlier this year after the company ran out of cash.
An AR glasses pioneer collapses

Daqri faced substantial challenges from competing headset makers, including Magic Leap and Microsoft, which were backed by more expansive war chests and institutional partnerships. While the headset company struggled to compete for enterprise customers, Daqri benefited from investor excitement surrounding the broader space. That is, until the investment climate for AR startups cooled.
Daqri was, at one point, speaking with a large private-equity firm about financing ahead of a potential IPO, but as the technical realities facing other AR companies came to light, the firm backed out and the deal crumbled, we are told.
As of mid-2017, a Wall Street Journal report detailed that Daqri had raised $275 million in funding. You won’t find many details on the sources of that funding, other than references to Tarsadia Investments, a private-equity firm in Los Angeles that took part in the company’s sole disclosed funding round. We’re told Tarsadia had taken controlling ownership of the firm after subsequent investments.
Augmented Reality Startup Daqri Raises $15M More, Troy Carter Joins Advisory Board

In early 2016, Daqri acquired Two Trees Photonics, a small U.K. startup that was building holographic display technologies for automotive customers. The U.K. division soon comprised a substantial portion of the entire company’s revenues, sources tell us. By early 2018, the division was spun out from Daqri as a separate company called Envisics, leaving the Daqri team to focus wholly on bringing augmented reality to enterprise customers.
The remaining head-worn AR division failed to gain momentum after prolonged setbacks in adoption of its AR smart glasses, including difficulties in training workers to use the futuristic hardware, a source told TechCrunch.
All the while, the company’s leadership put on a brave face as the startup sputtered. In an interview this year with Cornell Enterprise Magazine, Daqri CEO Roy Ashok told the publication that the startup was forecasting shipments of “tens of thousands” of pairs of its AR glasses in 2020.
Daqri, its founder and several executives did not respond to requests for comment.

PTI
   New Delhi, Sep 15 (PTI) Over 80 former MPs are yet to vacate their official bungalows in Lutyens' Delhi despite a stern warning by a Lok Sabha panel, sources said. They said the government is contemplating to take action against these ex-MPs under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act for their speedy eviction.On August 19, the Lok Sabha Housing Committee headed by C R Patil had ordered around 200 ex-MPs, who did not vacate their bungalows, to give up the facility within a week and disconnect their power, water and cooking gas connections within three days."Since the committee's order, most of the ex-MPs have vacated their official bungalows. But, 82 former MPs are, however, yet to vacate their bungalows as per a recent list," the sources told PTI.Sources in the Lok Sabha Housing Committee said this is not acceptable and that strict action will be taken against such former MPs."It was the panel's decision to ask ex-MPs to vacate their official residences. Now, if some of them have not done so, it is not acceptable. Strict action will be taken against them," the sources in the committee said.Notices are being sent to these former Members of Parliament, asking them to vacate their bungalows which had been allotted to them in 2014, another source said."If they (ex-MPs) do not give up official bungalows, action may be taken against them under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act."Once the eviction order is passed, power, water and cooking gas connections will be snapped," the source added.According to rules, former MPs have to vacate their respective bungalows within one month of dissolution of the previous Lok Sabha.President Ram Nath Kovind had on May 25 dissolved the 16th Lok Sabha with immediate effect on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet after the Modi government was formed for a second term.A few newly-elected MPs, who won in the Lok Sabha election earlier this year, have been staying at temporary accommodation as some ex-MPs have not vacated official bungalows.

The New Indian Express
AYODHYA: Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has claimed that the construction of the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya will commence by November.
He also stated that the decision of the Supreme Court, which is hearing the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, will be in favour of the Ram temple.
Swamy, who was in Ayodhya on a two-day visit, further said that the right to worship is a fundamental right and cannot be taken away by anyone. "The temple which is at the spot of Lord Ram's birth cannot be removed," he said.

The remark by the BJP leader comes just days after NDA constituent Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray called for action by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government to enable speedy construction of the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya.
The Shiv Sena chief had said that with abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the Modi government had shown that it was decisive in nature.
He added that after the Article 370 move, it was now time for construction of Ram Mandir and introduction of uniform civil code.
"We had said before the elections that the Kashmir issue would be resolved. The opposition was saying we would not let Article 370 go. I am proud of you Modiji," Thackeray had said even as he advocated the cause of Ram temple.

Cricket Australia
Play was delayed in bizarre circumstances during Australia’s T20 against the West Indies in Barbados when officials were made aware that the dimensions of the playing surface were incorrect.
After Australia spearhead Megan Schutt bowled Windies opener Britney Cooper for a duck with the fourth delivery of the match, the umpires came together and signalled for assistance from the stands.
It soon became apparent that the umpires believed the white markers that provide the boundary for the inner fielding circle were too far from the pitch, so the third official and the venue’s curator – carrying a measuring tape - were summoned onto the field.
Sure enough, the first marker they inspected at backward square leg was deemed to be too far from the pitch, and a five-minute delay followed while the remaining markers were checked and brought in, much to the bemusement of the waiting players.
The inner circle in women’s T20Is must have a radius of 23m (25.15 yards), as opposed to men’s matches where the distance is 27.43m (30 yards).
During the re-measuring process, umpire Verdayne Smith was heard to say: "He measured 30 to start, and I told him it was 25".
Speaking after the match, Australia captain Meg Lanning said allrounder Jess Jonassen first suspected that the markers were too far away from the pitch.
"The inner circle was a little too deep on one side" Lanning said.
"JJ (Jonassen) was at point and she came up to me and said she felt like she was really deep.
"So I asked the umpire and when we had a look it was a couple metres too deep, it was the men's circle but once we got that fixed it was all right."
When play resumed, a second head-scratching moment came just two balls later.
Australia believed they had Kyshona Knight run out after an ill-judged quick single, with Jess Jonassen’s accurate throw from point enabling keeper Alyssa Healy to whip the bails off with the opener visibly short of her crease.
But the Australians were then left puzzled when square leg umpire Jonathan Blades failed to react.
As the official approached the stumps to replace the bails, Australia allrounder Ashleigh Gardner asked if there had been a run out, at which point he gestured towards his ears to indicate he had not heard an appeal.
After a quick 'howzat' from the tourists, he responded by raising his finger, with Knight forced to depart for one as the Windies slumped to 2-1 after one prolonged over.
"She was out, but the umpire thought we hadn't appealed so he hadn't given her out yet," Lanning said.
"We thought we had, we thought she was so far out we didn’t need a massive appeal, we just appealed a little bit, but we definitely did and once we sorted that out we could all move on."
The umpiring was in focus again at the end of the 10th over when Sheneta Grimmond survived an attempted stumping from Healy off the bowling of Jonassen, with replays showing the batter’s foot was clearly in the air when Healy removed the bails. But with no TV umpire available for this match, Grimmond was able to continue her innings.
Australia are playing three T20Is in Barbados as they ramp up their preparations for the T20 World Cup on home soil next February and March.
Fans in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea can stream the series live and free on cricket.com.au and the CA Live App, while fans elsewhere can watch on the West Indies Cricket YouTube channel.

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd today inaugurated its Technology and Innovation Center in Arizona for which it plans to hire 1,000 locals by 2023, the company said. The IT services company also announced that it has surpassed its Spring 2017 commitment to hire 10,000 American workers as part of its ongoing efforts to accelerate the pace of innovation for US enterprises.
The Arizona Technology and Innovation Center, temporarily located at The Arizona State University (ASU) Scottsdale Innovation Center, has a special focus on autonomous technologies, Internet of Things (IOT), full-stack engineering, data science and cybersecurity.
Infosys’ investment in Arizona will amplify top local talent alongside the best global talent to shrink the IT skills gap in the state.
Hiring is currently in progress and the centre will move to its permanent location, a 60,000-square-foot facility, in the ASU Novus Innovation Corridor by 2020, accommodating up to 500 employees, Infosys said in a release.
“The inauguration of our Arizona Technology and Innovation Center is an important milestone in our efforts to help American enterprises accelerate their digital transformations," said Salil Parekh, chief executive officer Infosys. “Today’s inauguration marks our sixth Center opening in the United States, allowing Infosys to seamlessly collaborate with our clients across the country in an agile manner."
The centre includes a series of living labs, showcasing new prototypes in virtual reality, augmented reality and robotic technologies, and serves as a space to foster co-creation, training and collaboration. Through these living labs, the centre is said to allow Infosys to develop cross-functional solutions to pressing business challenges in areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, user experience and advanced digital technologies, such as big data and cloud.
As part of Infosys’ commitment to workforce development and resolving the STEM skills gap in the US, the company announced a partnership with InStride that will allow its employees to complete degree programs and continue education courses through ASU.

YourStory
The concept of ridesharing did not find many takers in India until recently. The idea started picking up, courtesy cab aggregating platforms like Ola and Uber.

It was during this time that Ashwarya Pratap Singh’s new Ford Figo met with an accident. 

Drivezy Founders

This was the lightbulb moment for Ashwarya, who was joined by his college friends Hemant Kumar Sah, Vasant Verma, and Amit Sahu to come up with a new concept: JustRide. The platform allowed people to rent cars to self-drive.

Initially, they began with leasing around 250 cars. Today, the platform, which has been re-branded as Drivezy, has expanded its services to include 4,000 cars and 16,000 two-wheelers. 

The team also launched operations in San Francisco in the US in August this year. And now, the team intends to expand its services to 10 cities in the US with a fleet of 1,000 cars by next year. 


On an average, a car on the Drivezy platform today clocks 120-130 kilometers per day, while bikes clock 85-90 kilometres every day. They claim to have a 234 percent increase in listed asset base. 

Early this month, Drivezy also entered into a strategic partnership with Gurugram-based hospitality chain OYO to park their vehicles at its properties. 

“We have already stationed more than 1,200 bikes at Oyo hotels in Bengaluru and Hyderabad,” says Ashwarya. 
While Drivezy seems to be growing at a breakneck speed, Ashwarya believes the concept of sharing in the mobility space was a problem waiting to be solved. He says cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Mumbai have a major problem of infrastructure, traffic, and parking. 


He explains that they believe the increasing penetration of internet in India, coupled with the need for cost-effective and sustainable mobility will nudge millions of urban Indians towards vehicle sharing. 

“We shall add another 70,000 bikes to our platform and take our services to 21 cities by next year. To consummate the high demand, we have also begun franchising our brand across India. Our franchise initiative has taken off a great start,” Ashwarya says. 

“We have raised an investment of $1.5 million from franchise investors and have already established 12 units in three cities. The franchises will play a significant role in our expansion plan as we look to establish 100 franchise units. We have mobilised assets worth $5 million through our franchises, and over the next quarter we shall enlist assets worth $25 million through the franchise channel,” he adds. 

This article is part of a series that highlights the turning point in a startup founder’s entrepreneurial journey.

Times Now
Hyderabad: Two veterinary doctors have been booked after one of the nine pet dogs of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao died. According to reports, a police complaint was lodged against the duo, accusing them of negligence in the treatment of the 11-month-old Siberian Husky. A post-mortem was also conducted on the Husky and the report is awaited. 
The two veterinarians - Dr Rajith and Dr Lakshmi Srinivas - run a private animal clinic in Banjara Hills road and have been booked under Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code. If proven guilty, the doctors face a jail term for up to five years. 
The nine pet dogs of the chief minister are reportedly taken care of by canine handler Asif Ali Khan. On September 10, the Siberian Husky stopped eating and Khan took him to the two doctors. The vets prescribed medicines but Husky's health deteriorated and it was taken to the animal clinic of the vets on Banjara roads where it died. 
Khan alleged negligence on part of doctors and filed a case with the police. So far the doctors have not come forward to comment on the case against them. 
Recently, Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan was booked by Rampur police for goat theft. According to reports, an FIR against Khan has been lodged on a complaint filed in October 2016 by Naseema Khatoon, alleging that Khan had broken into her house with some 25 others and had stolen her jewellery and three buffaloes, a cow, and four goats.

The News Minute
Moral policing continues unabated at Hyderabad’s St Francis College for Women, an arts and science college in the city’s Begumpet area. On Friday, multiple students were halted at the gates of the institute because their kurti was an inch above their knees, leading to an altercation with security staff.
Videos of the incident on Friday showed security staff tugging at the kurtis of students and asking them what they were wearing. A video shot from behind a gate also showed the security guard holding it open only for one person to pass through, and in another, a woman security guard can be seen scanning a group of girls and deciding who to send in —all of this, because the height of the kurti was not as prescribed.
Another video showed Principal Sister Sandra Horta questioning a group of students whose kurtas were above their knees. In the video, a few of the girls can be heard telling the Principal that they cannot keep changing wardrobe as everyone cannot afford it 
The problem overall dress codes began at St Francis at the end of July, when the college issued a bizarre circular making it mandatory for all students to wear kurtis that touch the knee or are longer, from August 1. The circular was sent on the college WhatsApp group, where the students usually receive their schedules and timetables forwarded from the management.

Students TNM spoke to allege that teachers often make them stand up in class, check the length of their kurti and only then decide to give them attendance for that particular lecture. If the length of their kurti isn’t satisfactory, the student stand to lose attendance for a lecture they attended, they alleged. One student also alleged that in cases where a student did not follow the dress code, then the girl’s parents had to apologise to the principal.

According to Ramya*, an undergraduate student at the college, female security guards were brought in to the college last week, and for three days, students were reprimanded if their kurti was not the ‘right’ length, but they were allowed to enter. However, things came to a head on Friday, when they were tugged at, pushed, and humiliated. 
“The first three days they allowed us to go in. They just shouted at us saying ‘what is this’, chased us and pulled us back, but they didn't stop us from going in. But on Friday, they started to stop because apparently they had given a warning,” she says.
Ramya says that this rule was brought in mid-year, and some students did not have the financial ability to buy a new wardrobe that conformed to the new rules. 
Furthermore, Ramya says that while some teachers support the students, students haven’t been allowed to have a constructive conversation with the management, but have been allegedly threatened about their attendance and their future. 
"People are getting angrier by the minute. We didn't want anyone to touch us. Now, the management is okay with these people behaving with us the way they are. And they believe it's okay because it's a woman and not a male security guard, so they can do that,” alleges Ramya. 
 
According to Vandana*, another student, the principal said that the guards were there for a reason, and that students had to follow what they said, and not waste her time. 
“We don't want to be a part of an institution that wants to institutionalise this kind of patriarchy. Speaking to us in such a tone, giving us subliminal messages that we are arousing males, I don't think is a very appropriate environment or a good environment for all of us to be in. I don't think it helps our intellectual development either,” Ramya alleges.
The students have decided to hold a protest on Monday against the college's dress code.
Despite repeated messages and calls, the Principal did not react.

Pakistan should stop promoting terrorism, otherwise no one will be able to prevent it from “breaking into pieces”, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday, 14 September.
Speaking at a felicitation programme in Surat for the families of 122 soldiers who lost their lives in the line of duty, Singh also warned Pakistan that if its people cross the Line of Control, the Indian Army will not allow them to return.
Khan, while speaking in Muzaffarabad on Friday, had urged the Pakistani people not to march toward the Line of Control until he asks them to.
Singh also said Pakistan was unable to digest India's decision to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and went to the United Nations to mislead it.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created such a belief and trust in India across the world that the international community is not ready to believe what Pakistan is saying, he said.
“Our neighbouring country is unable to digest India's progress. India's reputation is growing in the international arena under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and it (Pakistan) is unable to digest it. Such powers keep looking at India like vultures,” the defence minister said.
Singh asserted that if human rights are being violated anywhere, it is happening in “our neighbouring country”.
“You can go there and see what is happening with Balochis, Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains and Buddhists... A country like this is trying to defame India by talking about human rights violations,” he said, adding that the whole world is now understanding this.
India does not believe in the politics of caste, community or religion, it believes in the politics of justice and humanity, the minister said.
“By doing the politics of religion, they (British rulers) divided India into two pieces. But you must have seen that during 1971, Pakistan, which was made on the basis of religion, was broken into two pieces. And if this kind of politics goes on, no one in the world will be able to stop Pakistan from breaking into pieces,” he asserted.
Singh said no one would need to break Pakistan as it would disintegrate itself.
It broke into two pieces earlier, and the way it is treating its minorities - Balochis, Sindhis and Pashtuns - no one can say when Pakistan will break into pieces again, he said.
India's minority population has increased after independence, while rights violations keep taking place in Pakistan against Sikhs, Buddhists and others, he said. India's minorities were safe, are safe, and will remain safe, he said, adding that India does not divide people on basis of caste or religion.
The programme for the families of the fallen soldiers was organised by Maruti Vir Jawan Trust. The Maruti Vir Jawan Trust gave financial assistance of Rs 2.5 lakh to each of the 122 families.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s return to its full oil supply capacity after Saturday’s attacks on Aramco oil plants could take “weeks not days”, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Sunday.  
The attacks in Abqaiq and Khurais knocked down some 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of the kingdom’s oil production and Saudi officials have not given a timeline for restoring full supply. nL5N265033

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran rejected accusations by the United States that it was behind attacks on Saudi oil plants that risk disrupting world energy supplies and warned on Sunday that U.S. bases and aircraft carriers in the region were in range of its missiles. 
Yemen’s Houthi group claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks that knocked out more than half of Saudi oil output or more than 5% of global supply, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the assault was the work of Iran, a Houthi ally. 
The drone strikes on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, including the world’s biggest petroleum processing facility, were expected to send oil prices up $5-10 per barrel on Monday as tensions rise in the Middle East. 
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the U.S. allegation as “pointless”. A senior Revolutionary Guards commander warned that the Islamic Republic was ready for “full-fledged” war. 
“All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,” the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying. 
State oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day, at a time when Aramco is trying to ready itself for what is expected to be the world’s largest share sale. 
Aramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take “weeks, not days”. 
Another source briefed on the developments said Saudi oil exports would continue to run as normal this week thanks to large storage in the kingdom. 
But it remains unclear how long the oil production shut down will continue, because the damage to the infrastructure “was big” and could not be fixed overnight, the source added. 
Traders and analysts said crude may spike to as high as $100 if Riyadh fails to quickly bring back supply.  
The kingdom, the world’s top oil exporter, ships more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day. 
Riyadh said it would compensate for the loss by drawing on its stocks which stood at 188 million barrels in June, according to official data. The United States said it was also ready to tap emergency oil reserves if needed. 
The Saudi bourse closed down 1.1% with banking and petrochemical shares taking the biggest hit. Saudi petrochemical firms announced a significant reduction in feedstock supplies.  
“Abqaiq is the nerve center of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24-48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,” Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters. 
According to U.S. government information, 15 structures at Abqaiq suffered damage on their west-northwest facing sides. 
Pompeo said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim rival Iran. 
“Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” he said. 
Some Iraqi media outlets said the attack came from there. Baghdad denied this on Sunday and vowed to punish anyone using Iraq, where Iran-backed paramilitary groups wield increasing power, as a launchpad for attacks. 
Kuwait, which borders Iraq, said it was investigating the sighting of a drone over its territory and coordinating with Saudi Arabia and other countries. The cabinet said the prime minister ordered tighter security at vital installations. 
Riyadh accused Iran of being behind previous attacks on oil pumping stations and the Shaybah oilfield, charges Tehran denies. It has not yet blamed any party for Saturday’s strike, but linked it to a recent series of attacks on Saudi oil assets and crude tankers in Gulf waters. 
Riyadh says Iran arms the Houthis, a charge both deny. 
Regional tensions have escalated since Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Saturday’s attacks and called on all parties to exercises restraint and prevent any escalation. 
The European Union warned that the strikes posed a real threat to regional security, Britain called them a “reckless attempt” to disrupt global oil supplies and France said such actions could only worsen “risk of conflict”. Iran’s ally Turkey called for the avoidance of “provocative steps”. 
U.S.-IRAN TALKS 
The attack comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was possible at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month. Tehran ruled out talks until sanctions are lifted. 
White House adviser Kellyanne Conway did not rule out a possible meeting between the two but told “Fox News Sunday” that the strikes “did not help” that prospect.  
Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Trump that Riyadh was ready to deal with “terrorist aggression”. 
The Saudi-led coalition has responded to past Houthi attacks with air strikes on the group’s military sites in Yemen. 
The conflict has been in military stalemate for years. The alliance has air supremacy but has come under scrutiny over civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis that has left millions facing starvation. The Houthis, more adept at guerrilla warfare, have increased attacks on Saudi cities, thwarting peace efforts. 
The United Arab Emirates, Riyadh’s main partner in the alliance, has reduced its presence in Yemen due to concern over rising Iran tensions and Western criticism of the war, leaving Riyadh to try to neutralize the Houthi threat along its border.  
The Saudi-led coalition has responded to past Houthi attacks with air strikes on the group’s military sites in Yemen.

Bengaluru: Verification of the unique identification number (Aadhaar) would be compulsory for new dealers from January 2020 to curb malpractices in paying Goods and Services Tax, said GST Network's group of ministers' Chairman Sushil Kumar Modi.
"All new dealers will have to submit their Aadhaar number for authentication from January 1. Though currently optional, it has been made mandatory from the New Year (2020) to curb fake invoices that came to light after the new tax regime came into being from July 1, 2017," Modi said after a meeting of the group on Saturday.
Modi is also the Deputy Chief Minister in the Janata Dal-United (JD-U)-BJP coalition government in Bihar.
The GST Network has also decided to complete online refunding from September 24 from the central GST or the state GST.
"We have also decided to unveil the simplified new returns system from January 1," said Modi on the occasion.
The next GST Council meeting will be held at Panaji in Goa on September 20.

TechCrunch
Amazon  is testing an easier way for people to leave product feedback with the launch of one-tap ratings. The change is meant to encourage those who don’t have the time, energy or interest in writing reviews to still share their opinion about the product, which benefits the larger Amazon community of shoppers who are reliant on ratings and reviews to make better purchasing decisions.
If you have access to the new experiment, you’ll be able to just tap once to leave your star rating on any item, without having to fill out additional fields like a review title and written review, as previously required.
You’ll also be able to access these one-tap ratings from a number of places, including the “Your Orders” page on Amazon where you can tap the “Write a Review” button; by going to a product page directly; or by responding to solicitations sent to you from Amazon or those that appear on the homepage when you log in.
The process of leaving a one-tap review is extremely simple — you just select the star rating and you’ll then see a green checkmark confirming the submission.
Only those one-tap ratings from Verified Purchases will contribute to the product’s overall star rating. You’re also able to expand on your feedback later on, if you choose, by adding a review, photos or video.

The new feature could go a long way toward being able to collect feedback from a larger number of online consumers, as many don’t bother with writing reviews. It also could help balance out the ratings with feedback from real shoppers, as opposed to those who may have been incentivized or paid to leave reviews.
That’s against Amazon policy, of course, and is a practice the retailer has been cracking down on for years — including by outright banning incentivized reviews, by way of multiple lawsuits, fines and through suspensions of seller accounts. But there are still services out there offering to boost a product’s Amazon reviews through less-than-official tactics. And there are products on Amazon that continue to have suspiciously positive reviews, ranging from weight loss pills to Bluetooth headphones.
Flooding those products with legit reviews from real customers could bring about a more accurate rating, even if Amazon isn’t able to fully flush the scammers from its review community.
The new ratings test is showing both online and in the mobile app worldwide. Not everyone will see the feature at this time, as some customers will be in a control group.
Amazon confirmed the new feature is an experiment, not a public launch.
“We are testing a feature that allows customers to leave feedback easily while also helping shoppers get authentic customer ratings on products from a broader set of shoppers,” an Amazon spokesperson said.

Times Now
Kolkata: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday said that there is a state of "super emergency" in the country and called upon people to "safeguard and protect" the rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. Interestingly, Mamata's remarks have come on the occasion of the International Day of Democracy. 
"On International Day of Democracy today, let us once again pledge to safeguard the constitutional values our country was founded on. In this era of 'Super Emergency', we must do all it takes to protect the rights and freedoms that our Constitution guarantees," Mamata tweeted.
The Bengal Chief Minister has been highly critical of PM Modi government and has on several occasions accused the saffron government of imposing an "undeclared emergency" in the country. Several other opposition leaders including RJD chief Lalu Yadav, AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal have made remarks on similar lines, asserting that the NDA government was infringing upon the fundamental rights of the people. 
In May, during Lok Sabha election campaign, Banerjee said she felt "like giving one tight slap of democracy" to PM Modi. However, the saffron party was able to capture a historic vote share in the state, winning a whopping 18 of the total 42 parliamentary seats in the state. It's the first time that the BJP has touched a double-digit figure in Bengal. 
From a meager 17 per cent, the BJP's vote share has jumped over 40 per cent. Political experts believe that it was due to shifting of votes from the Left to the BJP and not because of Mamata being less popular in the state. 
Mamata has been at the forefront in criticising the government's policies. From terming India's moon mission Chandrayaan 2 "an attempt to divert attention from the economic disaster, " to calling NRC a "fiasco", Mamata Banerjee has been a strong critic of the Modi government.

Reuters
 (In SEPT 12 story, corrects name of European Union Aviation Safety Agency from European Aviation and Space Agency in paragraph 10) 
By David Shepardson 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress on Thursday asked Boeing Co’s chief executive to make several employees available for interviews as part of a congressional probe into the design, development and certification of 737 MAX aircraft involved in two crashes that killed 346 people. 
House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio and Representative Rick Larsen, who chairs the aviation subcommittee, said in a statement that while Boeing has provided substantial documents and shared senior management’s perspective, “it’s important to the committee’s investigation to hear from relevant Boeing employees.”  
The committee plans another Boeing hearing in the coming weeks and previously asked whistleblowers to come forward with any information about the plane’s development. Boeing has provided more than 300,000 pages of documents, a person briefed on the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  
Boeing said in a statement it was “deeply disappointed the committee chose to release private correspondence given our extensive cooperation to date. We will continue to be transparent and responsive to the committee.” 
The 737 MAX, Boeing’s best-selling jet, was grounded globally in March, days after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that followed a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. A total of 346 people died in the two crashes. 
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation’s inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX as well as how the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies new aircraft. 
Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights into December as a result of the MAX grounding, including American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines, while Southwest Airlines Co has canceled flights into early January.  
CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at an investor conference on Wednesday that the company is still targeting “early fourth quarter for getting the airplane back up in the air” but added that “ultimately return-to-service timing will be determined by the regulator.” 
The FAA has repeatedly said it will not certify the plane to fly again until it is safe to do so. 
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said on Tuesday it “intends to conduct its own test flights separate from, but in full coordination with, the FAA. The test flights are not scheduled yet, the date will depend on the development schedule of Boeing.” 
Muilenburg said it is possible not all regulators around the world will concurrently approve the MAX to fly again. Boeing has said it plans to conduct a certification test flight in the “September time frame” but Muilenburg did not give a specific date when asked on Wednesday. 
Some officials do not expect the 737 MAX to actually resume flights until early 2020. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 1 that a Boeing briefing in August was cut short by U.S., European and other regulators who complained the company failed to answer specific questions about modifications in the operation of MAX flight-control computers. 
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed frustration with the lack of some answers from Boeing.

Engadget
Apple's new iPhones may include a hidden feature. Citing "reliable sources," frequent Apple leaker Sonny Dickson says all three new iPhone models include the necessary hardware for bilateral charging, a feature that would allow the phones to wirelessly charge other Qi-compatible devices such as the Apple Watch. Apple, however, has reportedly disabled the feature within the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max's software. Dickson doesn't say why the company did this, which adds another wrinkle to an already interesting saga.
Reliable sources are saying iPhone 11 and 11 Pro do include the hardware for bilateral charging, but that it is software disabled. Uncertain whether this was removed prior to final production run.
Ahead of Tuesday's launch, bilateral charging was one of the things that seemed a sure addition to the iPhone's feature list. Both Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, two of the most accurate sources of pre-release Apple information, said the new iPhones would include the feature. Then, just days before the event, both reversed course.
While it's possible Apple could enable the feature in the future (if, in fact, it's there), it seems unlikely. Alongside the iPhone 11, there were rumors Apple planned to announce a Tile-like tracker called Apple Tags on Tuesday. We didn't get Apple Tags on Tuesday, but, at least in that case, there's information on the company's website that suggests they're on their way. There's nothing like that for reverse charging.
While mostly a vanity feature on Android phones like the Galaxy S10, bilateral charging has potential utility on the iPhone. Unlike USB-C, Apple's Lightning port doesn't support reverse charging, meaning you can't plug another device into the iPhone to charge it. Additionally, a lot of iPhone users own an Apple Watch and AirPods, and would likely appreciate a way to charge them in a pinch. We probably won't have to wait long to see if there's truth to the rumor. Next week, we should find out if the iPhone 11 has the hardware once groups like iFixit start taking apart the phone.

RT
Rabi Pirzada, a Pakistani pop singer and TV host, faces a fine and up to two years in jail after a clip of her cuddling a giant snake while denouncing New Delhi for revoking Kashmir's autonomy gained traction online.
In the video, which was originally posted on the singer’s YouTube channel on September 2 and later picked up by local TV, Pirzada berates Modi for “harassing Kashmiris” and says her reptile friends will be special “gifts” for him.
“See what I have prepared for you. So get ready to die in hell. Okay? And these friends of mine will feast on you,” the singer says in the clip before introducing her menacing-looking friends, including an alligator.
The video, which was allegedly filmed in the singer’s beauty salon in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan’s Punjab province, has since racked up almost 100,000 views, making headlines in both Indian and Pakistani media.
However, it was not until this week that the Punjab Wildlife Protection and Parks Department launched an inquiry into the starlet for keeping exotic animals – including pythons and an alligator – at her salon.
The Pakistani Wildlife Act prohibits keeping animals like these as pets, Wildlife Protection official Sohail Ashraf said, as quoted by Pakistan’s News International, adding that no permit exists that could be obtained to legalize their ownership. The official said that Pirzada is now looking at up to two years in jail for violating the law, adding that legal proceedings were launched after she repeatedly flaunted exotic animals on social media and her infamous clip was aired on TV.
However, the singer herself insists that it was her anti-Modi rant, not her affection for reptiles, that got her into trouble.
“For all those sick minded who r reminding me to get Lisence, where was wildlife before my threat to Modi? Can’t u see y they did this,” she tweeted on Saturday.
Pirzada, a native of the Pakistan-administrated part of disputed Kashmir and daughter of an army officer, has openly voiced her criticism of India’s decision to integrate part of Kashmir under its control, and has recently staged a ‘Save Kashmir’ rally, prompting accusations that she’s on Islamabad’s payroll. Pirzada denies taking orders from the Pakistani government, claiming she has received “zero support” from the authorities. 
There are several videos of Pirzada playing with snakes on her YouTube channel, including a two-month old clip called ‘snake charmer’. Pirzada claims that she has always been fascinated with snakes, which are “better than so many friends who are there to betray you.” The authorities are now trying to locate the animals, as the singer reportedly directed them to the wrong address. Once recovered, they will be handed over to local zoos, officials said.

Hyderabad: At a time when imposition of heavy fines for violation of traffic rules is evoking public anger in parts of the country, Rachakonda police commissionerate in Greater Hyderabad is trying an innovative method to make the motorists follow the rules.
Instead of imposing fines for violations, the traffic police is facilitating the violators to buy the helmet or obtain necessary documents so that they don't repeat the violations the next time.
Deputy Commissioner of Police (traffic) Divya Charan Rao launched the innovative drive on Saturday.
Those found without helmet were helped to buy the same on the spot while those not having documents like pollution checked or insurance were assisted to get the same from authorities concerned on the spot. For the violators found driving without helmet, the traffic police got the slots booked online with the Road Transport Authority (RTA) to obtain the license.
The initiative by Rachakonda police won appreciation from people. Netizens hailed the move, saying imposing penalties is not the only solution to deal with violations.
Telangana's minister for urban development and municipal administration K.T. Rama Rao also patted the police for the innovative move.
Rachakonda is one of the three police commissionerates in Greater Hyderabad and covers the suburbs.
Hyderabad and Cyberabad are the two other police commissionerates in the city.

Islamabad [Pakistan], Sept 15 (ANI): Pakistan could lose in a conventional war with India which could then be consequential in view that the two neighbouring countries are nuclear-armed, country's Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Saturday.In an exclusive interview to Al Jazeera, Khan said, "I am clear that when two nuclear-armed countries fight a conventional war, there is every possibility of it ending in a nuclear war. If I say Pakistan, God forbid, and in a conventional war, and we are losing, and if a country is stuck between two choices, either you surrender or fight to the death for your freedom.""I know Pakistan will fight to the death for freedom (and) when a nuclear-armed country fights to the death, there are consequences," he added.He said that it was in consideration to these consequences that Pakistan approached the United Nations and other international fora on the Kashmir issue."So that's why we have approached the United Nations, we are approaching every international forum, that they must act right now because this is a potential disaster that would go way beyond the Indian subcontinent," said Khan.Khan ruled out the possibility of dialogue with India in the aftermath of the country's decision to abrogate Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Islamabad has downgraded its diplomatic ties and suspended bilateral trade with India as a way to remonstrate. India has maintained that the move on Kashmir is its "internal matter" - a stance that has been supported by many countries - and asked Pakistan to review these decisions so that normal channels for diplomatic communications are preserved.

The Quint
Pakistan Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid on Saturday, 14 September said that the government should provide a tape recorder and a collection of songs by legendary Indian playback singer Mukesh to deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif who is serving a seven-year prison term in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.
Sharif, 69, was convicted in the Al Azizia Steel Mills case and sentenced to seven years in jail in the wake of the apex court's 28 July, 2017 verdict in the high-profile Panama Papers case. He has been serving the prison term since 24 December, 2018.
Prime Minister Imran Khan, during his US visit in July, had told a gathering of the Pakistani diaspora that he will ensure on his return to Pakistan that Sharif is not provided an air conditioner or TV in the Kot Lakhpat jail.
“I know Maryam Bibi (Sharif's daughter) will make some noise, but I say to her, return the money. It's as simple as that,” Khan had said.
According to people close to Sharif, the three-time premier, has a taste for classic Bollywood songs.
The Al-Azizia Steel Mill case was about setting up steel mills in Saudi Arabia allegedly with corruption money.
Three corruption cases - Avenfield properties case, Flagship investment case and Al-Azizia steel mills case - were launched against the Sharif family by the National Accountability Bureau in 2017 following a judgment by the Supreme Court that disqualified Sharif in the Panama Papers case in 2017.
Sharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing and allege that the corruption cases against them were politically motivated.

Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday accused Iran of leading attacks on Saudi oil plants that have cut the kingdom’s output roughly in half, as he ruled out Yemeni involvement and denounced Tehran for engaging in false diplomacy. 
Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed credit for the attacks on two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, including the world’s biggest petroleum processing facility. 
Pompeo, however, said on Twitter that there was no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. 
“Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy,” Pompeo said, referring to Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif.  
“Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” he added. The State Department declined to provide any evidence to bolster Pompeo’s claim. 
“We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran’s attacks,” Pompeo said, warning that the Trump administration would work with its allies to make sure Iran was “held accountable for its aggression.” 
The tweets signaled a more hawkish stance in Washington toward Tehran, following signs of a possible thaw in relations between the two nations after months of escalation.  
Last year, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 pact that aimed to keep a lid on Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and he has imposed a series of sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. 
But in recent weeks, Trump has said he would be open to meeting with Rouhani, perhaps on the sidelines of the United National General Assembly in New York later this month. Pompeo has said such talks could take place without any preconditions. 
Rouhani, for his part, has said that Tehran, which denies seeking nuclear weapons, would not talk to the United States until Washington lifts the sanctions. 
Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, a close Trump ally and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Saturday’s attacks showed Iran was not interested in peace and was instead pursuing nuclear weapons and regional dominance.    
“It is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,” Graham said on Twitter. 
Others cast doubt on Pompeo’s allegations. 
“This is such irresponsible simplification and it’s how we get into dumb wars,” Democratic Senator and committee member Chris Murphy tweeted. “Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it’s just not as simple as Houthis=Iran.” 
Washington’s allies overseas will want to see solid evidence of Iran’s involvement, said Suzanne Maloney, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. 
“It’s credible that the Iranians had something to do with this,” said Maloney. “We’ll have to wait and see how they’ll (the administration) marshal the evidence.” 
Saturday’s attacks follow earlier cross-border attacks on Saudi oil installations and on oil tankers in Gulf waters. 
Saudi Arabia, which leads a Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis, has blamed regional rival Shi’ite Iran for previous attacks. Tehran has denied the allegations. Riyadh also accuses Iran of arming the Houthis, a charge denied both by the group and Tehran. 
The White House said the United States was committed to keeping oil markets well-supplied in the wake of the attack and the U.S. Energy Department said the administration could release oil from strategic reserves if necessary. 
The attacks on the two facilities cut Saudi Arabia’s crude oil supply by around 5.7 million barrels per day or about 50% of its output.

Reuters
KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban on Sunday revoked their ban on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Afghanistan and gave a guarantee of security for its staff doing humanitarian work in areas under their control. 
Taliban leaders imposed a ban on the ICRC and the World Health Organization (WHO) in April saying the organizations were carrying out “suspicious” activities during vaccinations campaigns and not sticking to their declared missions. 
“The Islamic Emirate restores the former security guarantees to ICRC in Afghanistan and instructs all mujahideen to pave the way for ICRC activities and be mindful of security to this committee’s workers and equipment,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in a statement. 
The Taliban refer to themselves as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The spokesman did not refer to the WHO in his statement. 
Officials at ICRC and WHO in Kabul were not immediately available for comment.  
The WHO has been carrying out a vaccination campaign in Afghanistan, one of the last countries in the world where polio is endemic. The ICRC has been providing medical support for more than 30 years. 
Aid groups operating in Afghanistan stress that they do not take sides. 
The ICRC in particular is known for its strict neutrality in conflicts. 
It operates in Taliban-controlled areas with a guarantee of safety and helps to repatriate bodies from both sides after fighting between the militants and the Afghan army. 
The Taliban control or contest more than half of Afghanistan’s 410 Afghan districts.

Times Now
She has raised her voice against Nepotism and the ill-treatment that Bollywood often reserves for outsiders, and her approach towards addressing those issues has given her a controversial image. Actress Kangana Ranaut says as long as her intention is right, she does not regret anything she said so far.

"I always keep a check on my intention when I raise a voice against anything critical. Because I took names while starting the conversation on nepotism, sexual abuse, pay disparity or ill-treatment that budding actors face, things always went against my career. One cannot however ignore the importance of these topics. Criticism never made me feel bitter or hostile," Kangana told IANS.

In 2017, Kangana got into a controversy when she called the celebrated filmmaker Karan Johar, a "flag bearer of nepotism" on his television chat show.

"Today, people openly talk about nepotism. They have a clear opinion with a perspective. But did anyone talk about it earlier? For me, what matters is the larger goal. People rethink certain issues now that ignored for years," she said.

While she was highly criticised by a section of media for her ugly spat with a journalist during a promotional event of her last release, Judgementall Hai Kya, Kangana points out that the media has also encouraged her a lot for her work. She added that she never holds any criticism about her acting against anyone.

"As an actress, I am okay with constructive criticism from film critics because it is a part of my job. I have nothing against anyone. But there are many works I do volunteer for society -- like creating awareness to protect nature, planting trees, talking about rivers, and saying no to plastic. If someone makes fun of these efforts, I will not tolerate it," said the actress, who recently donated a certain amount of her income for the Cauvery Calling campaign to the Isha Foundation. The campaign is a 12-year-old effort to plant one lakh trees on the Cauvery basin.

NEW DELHI:  Going against convention, the BJP has puts its party MPs in charge of most parliamentary panels that scrutinise key ministries, with only the chairmanship of the standing committee on home given to Anand Sharma, deputy leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha. The panels on finance and external affairs will now be chaired by BJP MPs Jayant Sinha and P P Choudhary, respectively. In the previous Lok Sabha, Veerappa Moily and Shashi Tharoor of the Congress used to head them.

While Moily lost in the 2019 elections, Tharoor has now been made the head of the standing committee on information technology. “Govt has decided to end the tradition of the leading Opposition party chairing the external affairs committee. Apparently a BJP MP will now hold the BJP Govt accountable instead,” Tharoor tweeted.
Lawmakers from the BJP would be heading 13 of the 24 parliamentary panels, while Congress has bagged the chairmanship of three standing committees, down from four earlier. BJP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Bhupender Yadav, SP leader in Rajya Sabha Ram Gopal Yadav, TRS leader Keshava Rao, YSRCP leader Vijayasai Reddy and Kanimozhi, DMK MP and daughter of former Tamil Nadu CM Karunanidhi, will head some of the other panels.

The New Indian Express
NAGPUR: Amid the slowdown in the economy, Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday exhorted the industries not to lose heart, saying this phase will pass.
The Union Minister for Road Transport and MSMEs was speaking at a function to mark 65th foundation day of the Vidarbha Industries Association here.
"I know the industries are going through a tough time now. We want to increase the growth rate."
"Recently, I met automobile manufacturers at all India convention of the automobile industry and all of them were little worried," Gadkari said.
"I told them, Kabhi Khushi Hoti Hain Kabhi Gam Hota Hain (there are times of joy and times of sorrow), sometimes you succeed, sometimes you fail. Life is a cycle."
"So in your life too, because of the global economy, demand and supply, business cycles you face little problems sometimes. Even the (rest of the) world is facing this problem. So don't get disappointed, this time will pass," Gadkari said.
"And I certainly feel that in coming days we are going to be the fastest growing economy," he said.

India.com
New Delhi: A security guard at a toll plaza in Haryana was critically injured after a man smashed a broken tin drum on his head following an argument allegedly over toll amount on Saturday morning. The incident took place at the toll booth on National Highway 9 near Bahadurgarh.
The CCTV footage of the toll plaza showed the security personnel in an argument with a man in a white shirt, who pushed him. The attacker then picked up a broken tin drum and smashed it on the security guard’s head after which he fainted instantly on the road.
People at the toll plaza rushed towards the attackers, who were seen justifying thrashing the guard.
A couple of months ago, a woman toll booth operator was allegedly assaulted by a commuter after she stopped him from passing the barrier without paying the toll tax. The incident had taken place at the Kherki Daula toll plaza on June 21 and was also captured on CCTV camera.
In the CCTV footage of the incident, the woman staffer could be seen sitting, when at around 9 AM a black Scorpio approached the toll gate. Refusing to pay the tax, the driver broke the barrier and slapped the woman before escaping.
Earlier this year, a toll plaza booth employee in Gurugram was beaten up when he asked a car to stop and pay the toll tax at the booth. Following his (toll employee) intervention, four men sitting in a Toyota Innova tried to run over him. The man was put on the car’s bonnet and dragged for nearly 6 km by the four men.

Times Now
Shahjahanpur: Spelling fresh trouble for former Union Minister and BJP leader Chinmayanand, a girl victim has handed over 43 video clips to the SIT and said he (the accused) is a 'blackmailer'.
The girl in her new statement said that Chinmayanand is a 'blackmailer', he first filmed me while I was bathing with the help of his trustworthy aide and then started sexually exploiting me on the basis of that video.
According to IANS sources, the Special Investigation Team has handed over the videos and other items to the forensic team, so that when it appears before the monitoring bench of the High Court on September 23, it would be able to explain and prove everything.
Meanwhile, earlier the victim and her family who were showing full faith in the SIT probe have now changed their stance. Talking to the local media, they said that most of the evidence they handed over to the SIT against Chinmayanand has been tampered with or destroyed.
However, the victim and her family did not have any satisfactory answer about where they got this information.
A question also arises why the SIT is disclosing its progress in the case to the victim's family before turning up in front of the HC bench.
According to sources, the victim has handed over several videos of her's including the one in which she is taking a bath that allegedly was later used by the accused to exploit her.
However, from Director General of Uttar Pradesh Police Om Prakash Singh to state police spokesperson, and Inspector General of Police Naveen Arora, who is also leading the SIT, no one is ready to verify the claims made by the victim.
IANS also tried to contact the DGP but it did not get any reply to Whatsapp messages sent to the officer. Both the senior officers have kept mum and the SIT is shying away from answering any query by saying that the Allahabad High Court's bench is monitoring the matter.

The News Minute
The Greater Chennai Corporation has announced formation of a special patrol to check illegal hoardings and flex banners across the city. The move comes two days after a 23-year-old techie lost her life after an illegal flex banner fell on her bike and made her lose control of the vehicle. She came under the wheels of a tanker lorry and died a painful death on Thursday.
The Corporation has started removing unauthorized flex boards, banners and digital hoardings from across the city. The drive which began on Friday afternoon has seen around 3,400 illegal banners taken down from various places in the city.
Speaking to TNM about the move, Commissioner of Greater Chennai Corporation G Prakash said that stringent action will be taken against the printing press owners who make such digital banners and hoardings.
“Printers cannot print the banners unless there is a permission granted for the purpose,” he said. When asked why action cannot be initiated against those who put up the banners, he said that steps are being taken to pass orders making them also criminally liable.
The Corporation has also launched three special phone lines for the citizens to register their complaints related to illegal flex boards and hoardings. People living in Tiruvottriyur, Manali, Madhavaram, Royapuram and Tondiarpet can call to 9445190205 to lodge their complaints. People residing in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Ambattur, Teynampet, Anna Nagar and Kodambakkam can call to 9445190698 to lodge complaints. Residents of Valasaravakkam, Alandur, Adyar, Perungudi and Sholinganallur can call 9445194802 and report illegal hoardings in their locality.
The death of a young woman due to an illegal banner hoisted for the family event of an AIADMK functionary sparked massive outrage with citizens demanding that those responsible for the death be held responsible. While the police have arrested the driver of the tanker lorry and sealed the printing shop that made the flex board, local authorities who allowed the hoardings despite a court-ordered ban and the AIADMK functionary for whose family function the banner was erected remain at large.

The WikiLeaks founder was due to be released on September 22 after serving his sentence for breaching bail conditions when he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Assange spent almost seven years inside the embassy. 
On Friday the Westminster Magistrates’ Court claimed there were “substantial grounds” for believing he would flee if released from prison. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said Assange’s lawyer had not made an application for bail on his behalf, adding “perhaps not surprisingly in light of your history of absconding in these proceedings.”
WikiLeaks and Assange’s mother Christine criticized the court proceedings, saying the judge had refused bail before the defense team had a chance to even request it.
This morning’s hearing was not a bail hearing, it was a technical hearing. Despite this, The magistrate preemptively refused bail before the defence requested it.

Reuters
RIYADH/DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group said it attacked two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry on Saturday, knocking out more than half the Kingdom’s output, in a move expected to send oil prices soaring and increase tensions in the Middle East. 
The attacks will cut the kingdom’s output by 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd), according to a statement from state-run oil company Saudi Aramco, or more than 5% of global oil supply.  
The pre-dawn strikes follow earlier cross-border attacks on Saudi oil installations and on oil tankers in Gulf waters, but these were the most brazen yet, temporarily crippling much of the nation’s production capacity. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter, shipping more than 7 million barrels of oil to global destinations every day, and for years has served as the supplier of last resort to markets.  
While the Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack,  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put the blame squarely on Iran, writing on Twitter that there was “no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.”  
“Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” Pompeo said. 
Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told U.S. President Donald Trump by telephone that Riyadh had the will and capability “to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,” according to Saudi state news agency SPA. 
The United States condemned the attacks and Trump told the crown prince that Washington was ready to work with the kingdom to guarantee its security, according to the White House. The U.S. Department of Energy also said it was ready to release oil from its strategic petroleum reserve if necessary. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also said his department would work with the International Energy Agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialized nations, if global action is needed.  
Saudi Arabia, leading a Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis, has blamed regional rival Shi’ite Iran for previous attacks, which Tehran denies. Riyadh accuses Iran of arming the Houthis, a charge denied by the group and Tehran. 
Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said an investigation had been launched into who planned and executed the strikes. He said the Western-backed alliance would counter threats to global energy security and economic stability. 
Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said there were no casualties from the attacks.  
Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said Aramco would have more information within 48 hours, and it will draw down oil in storage to compensate for the loss. Aramco is in the process of planning what is expected to be the world’s largest initial public offering. 
“Abqaiq is perhaps the most critical facility in the world for oil supply,” said Jason Bordoff, who runs the Center On Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and served on the U.S. National Security Council during Barack Obama’s presidency. “The risk of tit-for-tat regional escalation that pushes oil prices even higher has just gone up significantly.”  
Abqaiq is 60 km (37 miles) southwest of Aramco’s Dhahran headquarters. The oil processing plant handles crude from the world’s largest conventional oilfield, the supergiant Ghawar, and for export to terminals Ras Tanura - the world’s biggest offshore oil loading facility - and Juaymah. It also pumps westwards across the kingdom to Red Sea export terminals. 
Two of the sources said Ghawar was flaring gas after the strikes disrupted gas processing facilities. Khurais, 190 km (118 miles) further southwest, contains the country’s second largest oilfield.  
“These attacks against critical infrastructure endanger civilians, are unacceptable, and sooner or later will result in innocent lives being lost,” the embassy quoted Ambassador John Abizaid as saying in a Twitter post. 
Andrew Murrison, a British foreign affairs minister, called on the Houthis to stop threatening civilian areas and Saudi commercial infrastructure. 
It was the latest in a series of Houthi missile and drone strikes on Saudi cities that had largely been intercepted, but have recently hit targets, including Shaybah oilfield last month and oil pumping stations in May. Both those attacks caused fires but did not disrupt production. 
“This is a relatively new situation for the Saudis. For the longest time they have never had any real fears that their oil facilities would be struck from the air,” Kamran Bokhari, founding director of the Washington-based Center for Global Policy, told Reuters. 
Aramco’s CEO said in a statement that the situation had been brought under control. A Reuters witness said the fire in Abqaiq appeared to have been extinguished by early evening.  
Regional tensions have escalated after Washington quit an international nuclear deal and extended sanctions on Iran. 
The violence is complicating U.N.-led peace efforts to end the Yemen war which has killed tens of thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine. The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
The coalition intervened in Yemen after the internationally recognized government was ousted from power in Sanaa by the Houthis, who say they are fighting a corrupt system. 
The coalition launched air strikes on Yemen’s northern Saada province, a Houthi stronghold, on Saturday, a Reuters witness said. Houthi-run al Masirah TV said a military camp was struck. 
The Houthis’ military spokesman, without providing evidence, said drones hit refineries at both Saudi sites, which are more than 1,000 km (621 miles) from the Yemeni capital Sanaa, and pledged a widening of assaults against Saudi Arabia.

Mumbai: The Trump Organization, which controls the Trump brand of luxury properties across the globe, will look at new branding and licencing deals in India—possibly even hotels—once US President Donald Trump demits office, his son has said.
“India is a market that we would be very interested post politics," Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of the President, told Mint.
“We have voluntarily given up the ability to do new deals internationally while my father is in office. After politics, we would certainly look at India and other markets. But that (India) would be a big focus of mine. Frankly, it would be easier for me to get going in India because of the relationships we have built up in the last decade," Trump Jr, who has been at the helm of Trump Organization since his father took office in 2017, said in a telephone interview.
This week, Trump Organization’s Indian partners Tribeca, and Gurugram-based M3M India Ltd flew around 100 Indian homebuyers to New York.

The Financial Express
Former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Saturday questioned Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s claim that rise of Ola and Uber affected the automobile sector, asking why the sales of trucks should also decline. Those in power were making “weird” statements, the former finance minister said, talking to reporters here. “People in the government are making weird statements. These statements will not lead to betterment of economy. But they will definitely affect the government’s image,” he said. On Sitharaman’s statement about decline in the automobile sector, where she spoke about people using app-based cab services instead of buying car as one of the causes, Sinha asked, “If companies like Ola and Uber caused a drop in passenger vehicle sales, then why there is a slowdown in sales of two-wheelers and trucks?” “Bihar’s finance minister (Sushil Modi) said there is recession due to Sawan-Bhado (the rainy season).
A Union minister (Piyush Goyal) is talking about Einstein’s law of gravity,” the former BJP leader said. Sinha also raised a question about Sitharaman’s announcement to organize a mega-shopping festival in India on the lines of Dubai Shopping Festival to boost exports. “The economies of UAE (United Arab Emirates) and India are different. India’s economy will progress only when farmers in areas like Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh progress,” he said. “We should have grown at a rate of at least eight percent.
But in the first quarter of the financial year, the GDP growth has come down to five percent,” he said. The missing three percent growth meant loss of Rs 6 lakh crore in just one quarter, he claimed. Asked about the government’s plan to merge certain public sector banks, he said, “I am not opposed to merger. But it will not reduce their non performing assets automatically.” The process may in fact harm the banks as their officials will get tied up in completing merger formalities instead of focusing on actual banking, Sinha said.

Times Now
Outgoing champions the United States won their final match on Saturday at the Basketball World Cup -- but it was still their worst finishing place in the tournament's history. Team USA defeated Poland 87-74 in a low-key "classification" game in Beijing to take seventh overall, their lowest position since the competition began in 1950.
Gregg Popovich's team at least managed to avoid a third defeat in a row, but it was an anti-climactic denouement to their title defence. Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz had a double-double of 16 points and 10 assists. This US roster is missing the NBA's elite names, but the Americans were still fancied to at least reach Sunday's final in China.
However, they were dumped out in the quarter-finals by France, then lost their subsequent classification match to Serbia, in what was billed as the title game that never was. The US have at least qualified to defend their Olympic title in Tokyo next summer. Sunday's World Cup final is between Argentina and Spain.

LIVERPOOL, England, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Liverpool came from behind to earn a 3-1 home win over Newcastle United thanks to Sadio Mane’s first-half double and a late goal from Mo Salah on Saturday, maintaining their 100% start to the season and winning their 14 consecutive Premier League match. 
Anfield was stunned into silence in glorious sunshine on Merseyside as Newcastle’s Jetro Willems sent a thunderous strike into the top corner — the Dutchman’s first goal in English football — to give the visitors a shock seventh-minute lead. 
The crowd were getting anxious as league leaders Liveprool were wasteful in possession, but the pressure never relented as Andrew Robertson set up Mane, who brilliantly equalised in the 28th minute. 
Liverpool had won each of their previous four home leagues games in which they conceded first and 12 minutes later they had turned another match on its head as Roberto Firmino’s trickery set up Mane to give the hosts the lead at the second attempt. 
Mane’s second strike meant Liverpool had scored two or more goals in 14 consecutive league games — equalling the Premier League record set by Manchester City in 2011 — with Egyptian forward Salah adding a third in the second half. 
There was no coming back for Newcastle as Liverpool strolled to their fifth straight win this term to move five points clear of second-placed Manchester City, who visit promoted Norwich City later on Saturday. (Reporting by Peter Hall; Editing by Ken Ferris)

Real Madrid returned to winning ways in Spanish league La Liga by eclipsing fourth-placed Levante 3-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. Goals from Karim Benzema and Casemiro helped Zinedine Zidane's men in seizing a late comeback from the visitors who staged an impressive fightback with two second-half goals. With Real's marquee UEFA Champions League clash against Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-German (PSG) lurking around the corner, it was expected from Zidane to give less scree-time to starman Eden Hazard on his competitive Madrid debut.

Former Chelsea stalwart had joined Madrid in the summer transfer and was handed a resounding welcome by the Real Madrid supporters at the monumental Bernabeu stadium. Captain Sergio Ramos, premier defenders Raphael Varane, Marcelo and Daniel Carvajal received starts from Zidane as the Madrid manager named a strong lineup.

Columbian midfielder James Rodriguez also received a surprise start along with German midfielder Toni Kroos in the midfield. The attack was led by Madrid's numero uno Karim Benzema who was cashed in on the support of Lucas Vazquez and Vinicius Junior on flanks to penetrate the Levante defence in the first half. Madrid enjoyed a goal fest of the first half with Benzema bagging a brace prior to Casemiro's goal which looked like a sucker punch for the visitors. However, Borja Mayoral and Gonzalo Melero turned things around for Levante with two second half goals. 
In the end, it was Benzema's sublime brace that turned out to be a difference-maker for the Blancos who managed to prevent Levante from ending the tie level pegging in Madrid's backyard. With the win, Zidane's side has climbed to the second spot with two wins in four games.    
"The second half was more complicated, especially at the beginning," Zidane said. "When an opponent scores at the beginning it's difficult. But we feel good - the first half was phenomenal. We had goals, good play and creativity. We have to try to keep that up for 90 minutes," he added.   
Table-toppers Atletico Madrid are eyeing their fourth La Liga win as they are lined up against Real Sociedad. Holders Barcelona will also play Valencia at home later during midnight. Valencia have sacked coach Marcelino Garcia Toral who has been replaced by former Real Madrid assistant coach Albert Celades.

Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel on Friday demanded internal emails, detailed financial information and other company records from top executives of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, and Alphabet Inc’s Google, widening the antitrust probe of Big Tech. 
The letters seek by Oct. 14 internal emails over the last decade from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, among others, about acquisitions. 
Apple shares fell about 1.8% after the market opened. While Apple had been mentioned as a potential target, the House letter offered the first concrete evidence of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation. 
Apple has faced criticism that its App Store’s policies and algorithms support its own products and stifle third-party applications. 
On Monday, the Texas attorney general led a group of 50 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories in a probe of whether Google abuses its market power in advertising.  
“There is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications,” said House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, who signed the letters along with Ranking Republican Representative Doug Collins and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee and ranking Republican Jim Sensenbrenner. 
“This information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,” Collins said in a statement. 
The lawmakers seek emails from senior executives on topics including acquisitions like Amazon’s purchase of AbeBooks, PillPack, Eero, Ring, Zappos and Whole Foods; and Google’s acquisition of AdMob, YouTube, Android and DoubleClick. 
They also seek information on various policies including Google’s decision to automatically sign into Chrome any user to logs into any Google service. 
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google referred to a blog post this week that said its services “create choice for consumers.”  
The committee requested information from the companies’ executives on market share, competitors, their largest customers for specific products and documents from other investigations.   
It asked Apple for information on App Store concerns such as the decision to remove some parental control apps and its policy regarding whether iPhone users can set non-Apple apps as defaults.  
 The committee seeks communications on Facebook’s purchase of Instagram, WhatsApp and Onavo and its decisions to integrate Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and to cut off apps from its social graph. 
The U.S. Justice Department said in July it is investigating “whether and how” large tech companies in “search, social media, and some retail services online” are engaging in anticompetitive behavior. Google said it received a formal request for documents from the Justice Department in late August.

Reuters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Friday announced sanctions on three North Korean hacking groups it said were involved in the “WannaCry” ransomware attacks and hacking of international banks and customer accounts. 
It named the groups as Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel and said they were controlled by the RGB, North Korea’s primary intelligence bureau, which is already subject to U.S. and United Nations sanctions. 
The action blocks any U.S.-related assets of the groups and prohibits dealings with them. The Treasury statement said any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitated significant transactions or services for them could also be subject to sanctions. 
“Treasury is taking action against North Korean hacking groups that have been perpetrating cyber attacks to support illicit weapon and missile programs,” said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.  
“We will continue to enforce existing U.S. and U.N. sanctions against North Korea and work with the international community to improve cybersecurity of financial networks.” 
The United States has been attempting to restart talks with North Korea, aimed at pressing the country to give up its nuclear weapons. The talks have been stalled over North Korean demands for concessions, including sanctions relief. 
Earlier this month, North Korea denied U.N. allegations it had obtained $2 billion through cyberattacks on banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, and accused the United States of spreading rumors.  
The Treasury statement said Lazarus Group was involved in the WannaCry ransomware attack that the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom publicly attributed to North Korea in December 2017. 
It said WannaCry affected at least 150 countries and shut down about 300,000 computers, including many in Britain’s National Health Service (NHS). The NHS attack led to the cancellation of more than 19,000 appointments and ultimately cost the service over $112 million, the biggest known ransomware attack in history.  
The Treasury said Lazarus Group was also directly responsible for 2014 cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures Entertainment. 
The statement cited industry and press reporting as saying that by 2018, Bluenoroff had attempted to steal over $1.1 billion from financial institutions and successfully carried out operations against banks in Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Chile, and Vietnam.  
It said Bluenoroff worked with the Lazarus Group to steal approximately $80 million from the Central Bank of Bangladesh’s New York Federal Reserve account. 
Andariel, meanwhile, was observed by cyber security firms attempting to steal bank card information by hacking into ATMs to withdraw cash or steal customer information to later sell on the black market, the statement said.  
Andariel was also responsible for developing and creating unique malware to hack into online poker and gambling sites and, according to industry and press reporting, targeted the South Korea government military in an effort to gather intelligence, it said.

The Financial Express
In his first remarks after being appointed as the Rajasthan BJP chief on Saturday, Satish Poonia, who has an RSS background, said there would have been no Hindustan if not for the Sangh. He also hit out at the ruling Congress in the state, alleging it has betrayed the farmers and the youths, and law and order situation has deteriorated under the Ashok Gehlot government. “The BJP will play a sharp, strong and effective role as opposition — both inside and outside of the house. We will try to make Rajasthan free from the Congress,” the 55-year-old MLA told reporters at the party headquarters here after being appointed as the state president. A large number of party workers and leaders congratulated him and garlanded him in the headquarters for his elevation.
BJP national vice president and former chief minister Vasundhara Raje congratulated him over phone. Poonia, a Jat leader, said that taking all castes and communities along will be his priority. When asked about his RSS background, he said, “If there was no RSS, there would have been no Hindustan. Because RSS is such a big force, ‘Bhagwa’ (saffron) is respected all over.” Poonia was currently a Rajasthan BJP spokesperson and was also looking after the party’s membership drive in the state. “The mandate in Lok Sabha elections has made it clear that people are with the BJP. But we will make the party stronger at booth level,” the MLA from Jaipur’s Amber constituency said. The post of Rajasthan BJP president was lying vacant since the demise of Madan Lal Saini in June. Poonia’s appointment comes just before local body elections in the state.
He said his elevation was dedicated to all the party workers. “I come from a small village and have worked for 40 years in villages, among farmers, tribal youths and will continue doing so. The title has changed but the working style will remain the same. The party workers are feeling happy because they feel that one of their own has been made the state president,” he said. “Local body elections and bypolls on two assembly seats are coming and we will work to make the party stronger at the ground level for our victory,” he said. Poonia, who belongs to Rajgarh town of Churu district, has been with the RSS since his childhood.
He began his student politics in 1982 and conducted a programme — ‘Dr Hedgewar olympics’ — to mark the birth centenary year of RSS founder KB Hedgewar in the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, in 1988. This was the first direct programme of the RSS in the university. Poonia served as RSS’ state general secretary for four terms between 2004-14. He was also the state coordinator for veteran BJP leader L K Advani’s ‘Jan Chetna Yatra’ in 2011.

Reuters
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Music publishers have asked a federal judge to let them double their lawsuit against Peloton Interactive Inc to $300 million, saying the maker of stationary bicycles has streamed more than 2,000 workout videos used without permission. 
The National Music Publishers’ Association, a trade group, said on Friday that since suing Peloton in March for copyright infringement, publishers have found a trove of additional songs that the New York-based company knowingly and recklessly offered to customers without first getting required licenses. 
These allegedly included songs from Adele, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, John Legend, Maroon 5, Meek Mill and Taylor Swift, as well as classics such as The Beatles’ “I Saw Her Standing There,” Ray Charles’ “Georgia On My Mind” and The Who’s “I Can See For Miles.” Publishers want to add 1,324 songs to their lawsuit, the trade group said. 
“Peloton fully understood what the copyright law required, having entered licenses with certain other copyright holders, while trampling the rights of plaintiffs by using their musical works for free and without permission,” the publishers said in a proposed amended complaint filed late on Thursday. 
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan must grant approval before publishers can pursue their expanded case. 
The proposed complaint was filed two days after Peloton said it planned to raise up to $1.33 billion in an initial public offering, by offering 46 million shares priced between $26 and $29 each. 
Peloton said its platform could have been developed only through “close collaboration” with major labels and music publishers, among others. 
“We will continue to defend ourselves against claims made in this matter and look forward to pursuing our counterclaims,” the company said in an emailed statement. 
In a Friday court filing, Peloton’s lawyers asked Cote to schedule a conference to address the publishers’ and NMPA’s alleged failure to turn over documents relevant to its case, saying the parties had reached an “impasse.” 
Founded in 2012, Peloton sells stationary bicycles starting at $2,245, in packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home. Unlimited access costs $39 a month. 
The case is Downtown Music Publishing LLC et al v Peloton Interactive Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-02426.

Times Now
Villeneuve: President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday unveiled the bust of Mahatma Gandhi, marking the 150th anniversary of the Father of the Nation and hoped that his legacy will inspire the mankind to tackle climate change and conserve ecology.
Kovind, in a special event organised here, thanked the commune of Villeneuve for celebrating Gandhi's legacy and naming a Square after him.
"He built his first hermitage in India on the banks of River Sabarmati. Today, we have brought him to the banks of Lake Geneva. You have given him a special place, close to nature and close to your hearts. It is a fitting tribute to a man who loved nature and cared so much for it," he said.
Noting that his teachings remain relevant even today, Kovind said, "his legacy shall inspire us as we work together to tackle climate change and to conserve our ecology."
The president highlighted the "special connection" Gandhi had with Villeneuve as he visited the town in 1931 at the invitation of Noble laureate Romain Rolland.



"In Villeneuve, Romain Rolland played Beethoven for him. They had long conversations on the Great War that had ravaged Europe and how peace could be secured for future generations," he said.
"As two democracies with deep respect for diversity, Mahatma Gandhi shall continue to guide us in our shared journey to bring peace and joy for one and all," he said.
Drawing a parallel between the commune system in Switzerland and the Indian village republics, Kovind said, "Gandhian thought has yet another connection with you. The communes have a distinct social and political role in Swiss democratic polity. It is very much similar to the way Mahatma Gandhi laid down his concept of Gram Swaraj or Village Republics."
Kovind said that Gandhi believed in the oneness of humanity.
"He embraced all cultures and all peoples. He listened to Hindu religious songs and western classical music with equal ease and understanding," he said.
The president recalled that the two countries last year celebrated the 70th Anniversary of the India-Switzerland Treaty of Friendship signed in 1948.
"This was the first Treaty of Friendship that India signed as an independent nation. The seed of amity that we sowed then, has today grown into a luxuriant tree of mutual trust, cooperation and understanding," he said.
Kovind, who reached Switzerland on Thursday, is on the second leg of his nine-day three-nation tour to Iceland, Switzerland and Slovenia.

Kathua (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], Sept 14 (ANI): Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Saturday said that scores of hospitals across the country were willing to invest in the "medi-city" for which the Central government has finalised land in both Jammu and Srinagar."We have decided to have a 'medi-city' in both Jammu and Srinagar. We have finalised the land. A lot of best hospitals across the country are willing to invest in them. We will bring them here and operate the medi-city," said Malik at a public meeting here.The governor said that Jammu and Kashmir is now directly connected to the national capital. "This is a golden opportunity. The situation is such that you can ask whatever from the central government. They have kept their hands open," he said.Malik was speaking at the inaugural function of a government hospital in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district.The Governor also said that he had done more work than any ruling government in Jammu and Kashmir."In the eyes of the country, Governor is a person who plays golf and does nothing for public, he or she just rests during their governorship. But the amount of work that we've done in last one year, I don't think even an elected government does that much work."On August 5, the Centre nullified provisions of Article 370, which gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir making it a Union Territory with legislature.

“Hamza Bin Laden, the high-ranking Al-Qaeda member and son of Osama Bin Laden, was killed in a United States counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region,” said a statement from Trump's office sent to journalists on Saturday.
The death of Hamza has deprived Al-Qaeda of his “important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father.” Within Al-Qaeda, Bin Laden’s son was “responsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups,” it added.
Hamza Bin Laden's death in an airstrike was first reported late in July. Back then, Trump said that the man was “very threatening” to the US, but declined to provide any further details. With the official confirmation of Hamza’s death, however, it still remains unclear when – and where – the US operation took place exactly.
