3719,Queen approves UK govt request to suspend Parliament before Brexit,UK's Queen Elizabeth II has approved the government's request to suspend the Parliament from mid-September till October 14. The suspension of the Parliament comes before Brexit which is scheduled for October 31. UK Opposition leaders have written to the Queen to express their concern over the government's move to suspend the Parliament.,Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson will suspend Britain’s parliament for more than a month before Brexit, enraging opponents and raising the stakes in the country’s most serious political crisis in decades.  Cheered on by U.S President Donald Trump, Johnson launched his boldest move yet to take the country out of the European Union by Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal, by setting a new date for a state opening of parliament. Known as the Queen’s Speech, the formal event will be held on Oct. 14 and be preceded by a suspension of the House of Commons, meaning parliament will not sit between mid-September and mid-October. The move, which had to be approved by Queen Elizabeth, limits the time opponents have to derail a disorderly Brexit, but also increases the chance that Johnson could face a vote of no-confidence in his government, and possibly an election.   It also risks dragging the 93-year-old, politically neutral queen into the dispute. So incensed were leaders of the opposition parties by Johnson’s plan that several have written to the monarch asking for a meeting to express their concern.  The queen acts on the advice of her prime minister. Her office declined to comment. Her speech at the opening of parliament is written by the government, outlining its plans for legislation.  “There will be ample time in parliament for MPs (members of parliament) to debate the EU, to debate Brexit and all the other issues, ample time,” Johnson told reporters.  Asked if he was trying to block MPs from delaying Britain’s EU departure, he replied: “That is completely untrue.” While suspending parliament ahead of a Queen’s Speech is the historical norm in Britain, the decision to limit parliamentary scrutiny weeks before the country’s most contentious policy decision in decades prompted an immediate outcry.    “Make no mistake, this is a very British coup,” John McDonnell, the second most powerful man in the opposition Labour Party, said. More than half a million people signed an online petition to object and the pound fell sharply. Cries of “Shame on You” and “Stop the Coup” could be heard from inside the walls of the parliamentary estate, as a couple of hundred protesters gathered near the bank of the River Thames to wave EU flags and show their disgust. “Democracy is so important. It’s taught from such a young age as such a vital thing about being a British person and today just completely ruins that, tramples it and throws it out,” said 17-year-old student Dylan Butlin, one of the protesters.  In a sign that Johnson’s move had marked a significant escalation in the long-running dispute, a group of cross-party lawmakers sought a legal injunction and the speaker of parliament said the nation’s democratic process was at risk.  The Church of England said a chaotic Brexit would hurt the poor and further damage a fractured nation.  But Johnson’s gamble was welcomed by Brexiteers, including Trump, an early backer of Britain’s departure from the EU, who said “Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for, & will prove to be ‘a great one!’ Love U.K.” A spokeswoman for the European Commission, when asked about the British suspension of parliament, said it was a matter for Britain to answer. More than three years after the United Kingdom voted 52% to 48% to quit the European Union, it is still unclear on what terms the bloc’s second largest economy will leave the club it joined in 1973. With just 65 days until exit day, parliamentarians are battling to prevent the prime minister from steering the country out of the EU without a transition deal, pitching one of Europe’s most stable countries into uncharted territory.  On Tuesday, the leaders of Britain’s opposition parties had agreed to seek to use parliamentary procedure to force Johnson to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit beyond Oct. 31. They may now try to bring him down.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would call a no-confidence vote when the time was right.  With Johnson holding a working majority of just one seat in the 650-seat parliament, members of his party who oppose a no-deal Brexit will have to decide where their loyalties lie.  The pro-EU Conservative Party lawmaker Dominic Grieve said he would find it difficult to “keep confidence in the government” in the circumstances while Philip Hammond, a former finance minister, said pro-EU politicians needed to act now.  In a sign of the pressure building across the political system, media reports said Ruth Davidson, who led a resurgence for the Conservatives in Scotland, had decided to quit.  The BBC said her resignation, expected to be announced on Thursday, was not sparked by the suspension but had been coming for several months due to family pressures and disagreements with Johnson’s approach. She sits in the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh and not Westminster.       Sterling fell sharply, losing around a cent against the U.S. dollar and the euro, as investors took the news as a sign that a no-deal Brexit, was more likely.   Johnson argued, however, that the move was designed to allow his government to press on with its domestic agenda.  He says he wants to agree a divorce deal with Brussels but needs the bloc to change its stance on a key sticking point around neighbour Ireland first. A leading campaigner in the 2016 Brexit referendum, he has also said Britain must leave the EU to maintain the nation’s faith in politics. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, said their base case remained that a no-deal Brexit would not occur on Oct. 31 and that an election would follow.  “It forces the hand (of Johnson’s opponents), compelling them to act sooner and more decisively if they wish to do so,” he said.   Parliament returns from its summer break on Sept. 3 before typically breaking up two weeks later to allow political parties to hold their annual conferences. Returning again on Oct. 14 would leave just over two weeks until Britain is due to quit the EU on Oct. 31.  Those lawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit will likely have to make their move next week if they are to avoid running out of time.

The funders said in a statement that Facebook had granted the 83 scholars selected for the project access to “only a portion of what they were told they could expect,” which made it impossible for some to carry out their research. They have given Facebook until Sept. 30 to provide the data. Their concerns focus on the absence of data that would show which web pages were shared on Facebook as far back as January 2017. The company had yet to say when the data would be made available, the funders added. Facebook said in a statement that it remained committed to the project and would “continue to provide access to data and tooling to all grant recipients - current and future.” The announcement comes only a few months after Facebook launched the research program, which opened the company’s proprietary data to independent scholars for the first time. Data access was meant to be heavily controlled, with special precautions to protect user privacy. The funding consortium includes both the conservative Charles Koch Foundation and Silicon Valley’s Omidyar Network. “We hope Facebook (not to mention other platform companies) will find a way to provide deeply robust privacy-protected data,” they said, as “independent scholarly analysis of social media platforms is essential” to understanding elections and democracy around the world.

3733,Near agreement on US withdrawal from Afghanistan: Taliban,The Taliban said on Wednesday it was close to an agreement with US officials on a deal that would see US forces withdraw from Afghanistan. In exchange for US withdrawal the Taliban will reportedly promise that the country would not become a haven for international militants. Taliban and the US are negotiating in Qatar to end the war in Afghanistan.,Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban said on Wednesday it was close to an agreement with U.S. officials on a deal that would see U.S. forces withdraw from Afghanistan in exchange for a Taliban promise that the country would not become a haven for international militants. Negotiations over how to end the 18-year war in Afghanistan have been held in Doha, capital of Qatar, since late last year. The ninth round of talks began last week. “We hope to have good news soon for our Muslim, independence-seeking nation,” said Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban’s political office in Doha. U.S. officials engaged in talks with the Taliban in Doha were not immediately available for comment. Two sources with knowledge of the negotiations said the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been leading the talks, is scheduled to be in Kabul to brief President Ashraf Ghani about the agreement. A senior security official in Kabul said the Taliban and U.S. officials had agreed on a timeline of about 14 to 24 months for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces. Details would be shared with the Afghan government before they were made public, the official said. Ghani, who is seeking a second term in September, has repeatedly offered to hold direct talks with the Taliban, but the group demanded a complete withdrawal of foreign forces as a precondition to start negotiations. The Taliban now controls more territory than it has since 2001, when the United States invaded following the 9/11 attacks, and the war has ground to a stalemate, with casualties rising among civilians as well as combatants. Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Ghani, said the government did not want U.S. forces to stay in Afghanistan over the long term, but added that their “conditions-based” presence was needed at this stage. “We want to end the bloodshed. We cannot accept the orders of the Taliban. They must accept our demands and we demand peace,” said Sediqqi.

3741,SpaceX Mars rocket prototype makes highest and final test flight,"Elon Musk-led aerospace startup SpaceX's prototype rocket for its Mars mission, Starhopper, successfully completed its final, low-altitude test flight. The prototype achieved its highest altitude ever at about 500 feet in the test, which lasted around 50 seconds. The prototype had first flown on July 25 for around 20 seconds and had achieved a height of around 65 feet.",TechCrunch,"SpaceX  has completed a second low-altitude test flight of its “Starhopper” demonstration prototype, which is being used to test technologies that will be used to build the full-scale next-generation SpaceX “Starship” spacecraft. This test involved “hopping” the Starhopper (hence the name, get it?) to a height of around 150 meters (or a little less than 500 feet), the highest it’s flown so far, at a SpaceX test facility in Texas. After the hop, which lasted around 50 seconds (the GIF above is sped up 2X), it successfully navigated itself to a target landing pad a short distance away.This is the second untethered test trip for the Starhopper, and is intended to be its last, as SpaceX moves forward with construction of its Starship Mk I and Mk II prototypes, which is taking place currently and simultaneously at sites in Florida and Texas. Today’s attempt was the second try after a planned test yesterday was aborted at the last second, with SpaceX resetting and ensuring everything was in place for this longer hop, which lasted just less than a minute.In July, SpaceX ran its first untethered hop, which is designed to test the operation of the Raptor engine SpaceX is developing for Starship, along with other subsystems for use in the production Starship. That flew only for around 22 seconds, and attained a height of just 20 meters (a little over 65 feet).Construction is currently in progress at both SpaceX’s Texas and Florida facilities on its full-scale Starship prototypes, which SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is ambitious will begin their own flight testing later this year, in perhaps as little as a few months. The larger prototypes, which should be closer to what will actually launch, will test more Raptor engines working together and aim to fly to higher altitudes, another key step as the company works toward a true first orbital test flight.Ultimately, SpaceX is hoping to replace both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy entirely with different configurations of Starship, which will help the company in terms of cost efficiency thanks to its fully reusable nature and streamlining all of its rocket construction efforts around one type of vehicle.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/spacex-starhopper-hops-to-around-500-feet-and-flies-for-just-under-a-minute-in-new-test-flight/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
3743,"People assume we're a fintech firm, we're a lifestyle one: CRED CEO","Bengaluru-based startup CRED's Founder and CEO Kunal Shah, at a recent interview, said that people assume the credit card bill payment startup is a fintech company. ""No. We are a lifestyle company,"" he said, adding, ""We are creating a network of high-trust people and eventually we want the members to do interesting things."" Shah had announced CRED in 2018.",YourStory,"Cred Founder Kunal Shah and YourStory Founder & CEO Shradha SharmaKunal Shah is an entrepreneur who is constantly raising the bar of doing business.Last night, his nine-month-old second startup Cred was in the news again for having raised close to $120 million (approx. Rs 861.39 crores) as a part of its Series B round led by fintech fund Ribbit Capital, Gemini Investments, as well as existing investor Sequoia Capital (through its fund, SCI Investments V).Cred is a members-only app, which incentivises customers and gives exclusive rewards for paying credit card bills in a timely manner.Other investors participating in this round included Russian tech fund RTP Global (earlier Ru-Net), Asia based investment management firm HillHouse, New-York based investment fund Tiger Global, San-Francisco Greenoaks Capital, DF International, and US-based General Catalyst and Dragoneer.However, Kunal says Cred is more than just a fintech company, as most seem to assume. ""People assume that we are a fintech company. No. We are a lifestyle company. We are creating a network of high-trust people and eventually we want the members to do interesting things. Tomorrow, classified could be a potential business for us, or apartment listing.”One thing you have to grant Kunal Shah is that there’s never a dull moment with him. Whether it is talking about the Indian startup ecosystem or the country’s socialism mindset versus a capitalistic one, he comes up with interesting argument points.Watch the full interview here.A seasoned entrepreneur who has witnessed the unfolding of the Indian startup ecosystem from its early days, Kunal is on to his second startup that made news even before he launched it.As he himself notes on his observation of the Indian startup ecosystem, “We are now witnessing a wave of second-time and third-time entrepreneurs and that is going to be powerful.”A maverick entrepreneur, Kunal had a successful exit with his first startup Freecharge that he started in 2010 along with Sandeep Tandon.In 2015, Snapdeal acquired Freecharge for $400 million (at that time it was billed as the biggest venture capital exit in the Indian startup ecosystem). In 2017, Axis Bank acquired Freecharge for $60 million.Kunal, however, did not rest on his laurels, but occupied himself gainfully understanding the manoeuvrings from the two sides of the investment table -- both from the investor side as well as the founder side.A heavy dose of paranoia and curiosity is what has worked for him, he tells me.I asked him about his days at Sequoia and YCombinator, and travelling across the world, especially China, and then finally settling to become a founder again. “I enjoyed my stint at Sequoia and learned so many things. Just sitting in the board meetings and seeing so many things unfold itself was a huge learning,” he says.But it wasn’t the time when he wanted to be on the other side. He says,However, at a time when businesses are going after India’s next 500 million population, isn’t Cred going in a different direction by looking at targeting the 30/40 million urban population? Perhaps one of the few non-engineer founders, Kunal’s response is a validation of the benefits of a liberal arts education.“India’s per capita income does not support any kind of internet business model which offer convenience to the consumer. But global companies love to come to India so that they can build their MAU (monthly active users) and DAU (daily active users) farms. They can add to their global numbers and look good in the public market,” he says.He supports this argument with a Bollywood example. “If you look at the top three Khans, 80 percent of their box office revenues comes from only 2000 to 3000 screens that are multiplexes. So the data about whether the market is ready for internet business models is definitely skewed towards the 20/30 million. Market future and market readiness are very different. Often we confuse the data.”The idea for Cred rose from months of research and talking to hundreds of people. As Kunal says, he does not believe in the fail fast, pivot concept. “As entrepreneurs, the only currency we have less of is time. So it is best to go prepared.”And prepared he was. The idea of Cred is to be like a gated community of high-trust individuals and then eventually figure out a way for them to connect and create interesting business models on top of it.Kunal ShahKunal emphasises that we as a nation by design are mistrusting, hence building a platform of high-trust makes good business sense. “In whichever nation there is mistrust, there is a concentration of trust. For example, 80 to 90 percent of all Bollywood revenue comes from 20/30 people. Similarly for the market cap. A Tata can do salt to car to furniture,” he adds.For someone who has built himself a credible social profile by not only sharing his diverse views but also keenly observing, Kunal has an interesting take on the Indian startup ecosystem.According to Kunal, over here, we have a zero-sum mind. “Sab kuch chupa, chupa ke... We feel we have to score the highest. Wealth is not zero sum, wealth is expanding,” he says. Indeed, for entrepreneurs playing the capitalism gave, it is important to know what capitalism is.The game in the Indian startup ecosystem is surely changing. As Kunal says second-time founders have better ability to raise capital, build better products, and get better partnerships with merchants and banks. “This will make the game even harder, because the quality of people you need to play this game will be superior now.”",https://yourstory.com/2019/08/kunal-shah-cred-funding-interview-sequoia?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Currently, 100% FDI is allowed for coal and lignite mining for captive consumption by power projects as wells as by iron and steel, and cement units. State-owned Coal India currently accounts for over 80% of India's domestic coal output.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s cabinet on Wednesday approved further liberalizing of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules in four sectors, in an effort to get economic growth back on track. The government approved foreign investment in digital media up to stakes of 26%, allowed 100% foreign investment for coal mining, associated infrastructure and sales of fuel. Till now, foreign investment was only allowed in coal mines allotted for captive use, meaning for use by the companies themselves. The new mining investment policy will to open up investment avenues for companies like PeaBody, Glencore and BHP Group Ltd. New Delhi also allowed 100% foreign direct investment in contract manufacturing and eased sourcing norms for single-brand retailers. The government said single-brand retail firms would be permitted to open online stores before setting up bricks-and-mortar stores, making it easier for firms like Apple Inc, which do not operate retail stores in the country, to start selling their products online.    Lack of investment was partly responsible for the country’s relatively sluggish economic growth of 5.8% in the January-March quarter. Analysts predict a slower growth rate for April-June, data on which is expected to be released on Friday. Last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a series of measures to help the economy and financial markets, and earlier this week the central bank said it would transfer nearly $21 billion in dividends, 64% more than expected, which could be used to further stimulate the economy. “Liberalising foreign direct investment will help in increasing economic growth” Piyush Goyal, trade and railways minister, told reporters in New Delhi.     Presenting the annual budget for 2019/20 in July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the government would hold discussions with stakeholders to relax FDI rules in the aviation, media, animation and insurance sectors, and ease rules for single-brand retailers. “The FDI relaxations fulfils long standing reforms sought by many companies that wanted to set up shop in India. Particularly, easing local sourcing norms and contract manufacturing will help us compete with manufacturing hubs in South and south east Asia,” said Vaibhav Kakkar, partner at a law firm L&L Partners.

Uganda Airlines, founded by the country's former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, was liquidated in 2001. The airline received its first two CRJ900 planes from Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier in April.",Reuters,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda on Tuesday relaunched its national carrier, Uganda Airlines, hoping to take a slice of the East African aviation business that is dominated by Ethiopian Airlines ETHA.UL The country is banking on its emerging oil industry and the traditional tourism sector to generate international traffic to sustain the airline.  Though air traffic in Africa is forecast to grow 6% a year, twice as quickly as mature markets, over the next two decades, most state-owned flag carriers on the continent are losing money. The notable exception is Ethiopian Airlines, which analysts say has avoided the mistakes of other regional carriers and not fallen prey to political interference. “We undertake to be a world class airline that will exceed customer expectations through high quality service,” Ugandan Airlines CEO Ephraim Bagenda said at a ceremony at Entebbe, the country’s sole international airport, south of the capital Kampala.   The airline will initially fly to seven regional destinations in Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, South Sudan, and Burundi, the CEO said ahead of the inaugural flight to Kenya’s capital Nairobi. In November, the airline would launch flights to destinations in south and central Africa, he said. But Uganda Airlines will face stiff competition not only from Ethiopian Airlines, but also from Rwanda and Tanzania which have also poured cash into their flag carriers in the past few years, though with far less success than Ethiopia.    Another rival regional carrier Kenya Airways (KQNA.NR) has also faced challenges in its efforts to expand. It became loss-making in 2014 after buying a number of aircraft which coincided with a slump in tourist and business travel to Kenya blamed on a spate of attacks by Somalia-based Islamist militants.      The airline has not recovered and was renationalized in July in what analysts said was a last-ditch effort to save it. Uganda Airlines, founded by the country’s former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, was liquidated in 2001 during a push to privatize state firms. Its revival will “reduce the cost of air transport and ease connectivity to and from Uganda,” Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda said at the ceremony. Ugandans spend about $450 million annually on foreign travel and the state-owned airline would help keep some of this cash within the national economy, Rugunda said. Citizens would also benefit from direct flights from their capital over expensive, indirect routes on rival airlines, the prime minister said. The airline received its first two CRJ900 planes from Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier (BBDb.TO) in April. Two more of those planes are expected next month, according to the airline.  It expects to receive an Airbus (AIR.PA) A330 Neo in late 2020, then a second in early 2021, the CEO told Reuters in July, adding that the two wide-body planes will enable the airline to expand to destinations in the Gulf and China.  Each Bombardier cost around $27 million while the carrier will pay about $110 million for each of the Airbus aircrafts.  The airline is wholly publicly funded and forecasts that it will be self-financing after two years, the CEO told Reuters in July.

Under the terms of the all-stock merger being discussed, Altria shareholders would receive no premium and own between 41% to 42% of the combined company, with Philip Morris shareholders owning the remainder, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the details publicly. The board of the combined company would be split evenly between Philip Morris and Altria directors, the source said. If the deal negotiations prove successful, an agreement could be reached by the end of September, the source added. The two U.S.-headquartered companies separated 11 years ago to focus on different geographic markets, at a time when tobacco stocks generated steady yields. Since then, the industry has been disrupted by a move away from traditional smoking into e-cigarettes and vaping.  The two have responded with new offerings. Philip Morris, which operates outside the United States, has developed a heated tobacco product called iQOS. Altria, which operates in the United States and still sells Marlboro in the country, acquired a 35% stake in vaping company Juul Labs Inc last year for $12.8 billion. Some analysts and investors fretted that the lack of geographic overlap between the two companies could limit the value of operational synergies. Philip Morris and Altria shares ended trading on Tuesday down 7.8% and 4%, respectively, giving the companies market capitalizations of $112 billion and $84.5 billion. “There currently is no overlap in operations of both companies other than the IQOS licensing agreement in the U.S. As such there would be little in the way of cost synergies other than corporate overheads and better leafbuying power,” Jefferies analysts said in a research note.  Philip Morris and Altria see scope in consolidating their manufacturing operations to generate annual synergies of more than $800 million, according to the source. Industry-wide cigarette sales volumes tumbled 4.5% on an adjusted basis in 2018, according to analysts at Cowen. Global sales of cigarettes were estimated at $714 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International. GRAPHIC: Market Shares of Tobacco Companies Worldwide - here In contrast, the e-cigarette market was worth about $11 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at more than 8% annually over the next five years, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence. In April, Philip Morris won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell iQOS in the United States.  “With disruption facing the world of tobacco, we can see some merit in a re-merger,” Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott said in a note. “The combined entity - Philip Morris 2.0 - could present a united front” on next-generation products such as iQOS, and “go about a coordinated global brand-building exercise the same way Philip Morris originally built Marlboro.”  Unlike combustible cigarettes, iQOS devices heat tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper, generating an aerosol that contains nicotine. They are different from e-cigarettes such as the popular Juul device, which vaporizes a nicotine-filled liquid. Altria already can market iQOS in the United States under a licensing agreement, which includes royalty payments to Philip Morris. A merger between the two companies would simplify that agreement. The source close to the deal talks said the merger negotiations started as an extension of this partnership. At the same time, Altria could tap into Philip Morris’ global sales force to aid in Juul’s international expansion.  In a note to clients on Tuesday, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said a deal would create the leading global nicotine company by improving cash flow and accelerating the worldwide rollout of Juul and iQOS. Philip Morris has annual revenue of nearly $30 billion, while Altria generated about $20 billion last year. Both companies said there could be no assurance a deal would be reached.  Any deal would need to be approved by the companies’ respective boards and shareholders.

This will be among the first studies after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asked the CCI to initiate more cases on its own to investigate antitrust practices and conduct market studies.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s antitrust watchdog plans to conduct an assessment of the country’s media and broadcasting sector to ensure that any competition concerns are identified and resolved swiftly, a government document seen by Reuters showed. The study will be among the first after India’s finance minister last week asked the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to initiate more cases on its own to investigate antitrust practices and conduct market studies. The study, which a source with direct knowledge of the matter said is not linked to any ongoing investigation, will examine the competition landscape in a sector that includes the likes of Walt Disney’s Star India and India’s Reliance Industries. India’s vibrant media sector is also crowded with hundreds of television news channels, newspapers and online news websites, which deliver content in various languages. “This (study) would ensure that new practices and technologies in this dynamic sector, which may be affecting competition adversely, are identified quickly and remedial measures ... are adopted fast,” the CCI said in the document. The CCI did not respond to a request for comment. The watchdog is in the process of choosing an independent agency to conduct the study on its behalf, the source said. It has already initiated a similar review of India’s booming e-commerce sector, in which foreign players such as Amazon.com and Walmart’s Flipkart operate.  Reuters has previously reported that Amazon and Flipkart are unlikely to participate fully in that study for fear of revealing trade secrets. Nisha Kaur Uberoi, head of competition law at Indian law firm Trilegal, said such studies will make the CCI better equipped to address competition concerns and speed the approval process in regulatory reviews of mergers and acquisitions. The assessment of the media and broadcasting sector will seek to assess the regulatory frameworks, ownership patterns and market trends in terms of viewers and advertisers, the 19-page CCI document said. The study will cover print, electronic and online media, broadcasting companies, content providers and industry bodies, it said, citing the effects of rapid technological change on the sector’s competition landscape.

3764,UK government asks Queen to suspend Parliament ahead of Brexit,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson-led UK government has asked the Queen to suspend the Parliament from mid-September until October 13. This will effectively reduce the time for MPs to pass laws to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Johnson said he would set October 14 for the Queen's speech, the formal opening of a new parliament session.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson will suspend Britain’s parliament for more than a month before Brexit, enraging opponents and raising the stakes in the country’s most serious political crisis in decades.  Cheered on by U.S President Donald Trump, Johnson launched his boldest move yet to take the country out of the European Union by Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal, by setting a new date for a state opening of parliament. Known as the Queen’s Speech, the formal event will be held on Oct. 14 and be preceded by a suspension of the House of Commons, meaning parliament will not sit between mid-September and mid-October. The move, which had to be approved by Queen Elizabeth, limits the time opponents have to derail a disorderly Brexit, but also increases the chance that Johnson could face a vote of no-confidence in his government, and possibly an election.   It also risks dragging the 93-year-old, politically neutral queen into the dispute. So incensed were leaders of the opposition parties by Johnson’s plan that several have written to the monarch asking for a meeting to express their concern.  The queen acts on the advice of her prime minister. Her office declined to comment. Her speech at the opening of parliament is written by the government, outlining its plans for legislation.  “There will be ample time in parliament for MPs (members of parliament) to debate the EU, to debate Brexit and all the other issues, ample time,” Johnson told reporters.  Asked if he was trying to block MPs from delaying Britain’s EU departure, he replied: “That is completely untrue.” While suspending parliament ahead of a Queen’s Speech is the historical norm in Britain, the decision to limit parliamentary scrutiny weeks before the country’s most contentious policy decision in decades prompted an immediate outcry.    “Make no mistake, this is a very British coup,” John McDonnell, the second most powerful man in the opposition Labour Party, said. More than half a million people signed an online petition to object and the pound fell sharply. Cries of “Shame on You” and “Stop the Coup” could be heard from inside the walls of the parliamentary estate, as a couple of hundred protesters gathered near the bank of the River Thames to wave EU flags and show their disgust. “Democracy is so important. It’s taught from such a young age as such a vital thing about being a British person and today just completely ruins that, tramples it and throws it out,” said 17-year-old student Dylan Butlin, one of the protesters.  In a sign that Johnson’s move had marked a significant escalation in the long-running dispute, a group of cross-party lawmakers sought a legal injunction and the speaker of parliament said the nation’s democratic process was at risk.  The Church of England said a chaotic Brexit would hurt the poor and further damage a fractured nation.  But Johnson’s gamble was welcomed by Brexiteers, including Trump, an early backer of Britain’s departure from the EU, who said “Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for, & will prove to be ‘a great one!’ Love U.K.” A spokeswoman for the European Commission, when asked about the British suspension of parliament, said it was a matter for Britain to answer. More than three years after the United Kingdom voted 52% to 48% to quit the European Union, it is still unclear on what terms the bloc’s second largest economy will leave the club it joined in 1973. With just 65 days until exit day, parliamentarians are battling to prevent the prime minister from steering the country out of the EU without a transition deal, pitching one of Europe’s most stable countries into uncharted territory.  On Tuesday, the leaders of Britain’s opposition parties had agreed to seek to use parliamentary procedure to force Johnson to ask Brussels for a delay to Brexit beyond Oct. 31. They may now try to bring him down.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would call a no-confidence vote when the time was right.  With Johnson holding a working majority of just one seat in the 650-seat parliament, members of his party who oppose a no-deal Brexit will have to decide where their loyalties lie.  The pro-EU Conservative Party lawmaker Dominic Grieve said he would find it difficult to “keep confidence in the government” in the circumstances while Philip Hammond, a former finance minister, said pro-EU politicians needed to act now.  In a sign of the pressure building across the political system, media reports said Ruth Davidson, who led a resurgence for the Conservatives in Scotland, had decided to quit.  The BBC said her resignation, expected to be announced on Thursday, was not sparked by the suspension but had been coming for several months due to family pressures and disagreements with Johnson’s approach. She sits in the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh and not Westminster.       Sterling fell sharply, losing around a cent against the U.S. dollar and the euro, as investors took the news as a sign that a no-deal Brexit, was more likely.   Johnson argued, however, that the move was designed to allow his government to press on with its domestic agenda.  He says he wants to agree a divorce deal with Brussels but needs the bloc to change its stance on a key sticking point around neighbour Ireland first. A leading campaigner in the 2016 Brexit referendum, he has also said Britain must leave the EU to maintain the nation’s faith in politics. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, said their base case remained that a no-deal Brexit would not occur on Oct. 31 and that an election would follow.  “It forces the hand (of Johnson’s opponents), compelling them to act sooner and more decisively if they wish to do so,” he said.   Parliament returns from its summer break on Sept. 3 before typically breaking up two weeks later to allow political parties to hold their annual conferences. Returning again on Oct. 14 would leave just over two weeks until Britain is due to quit the EU on Oct. 31.  Those lawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit will likely have to make their move next week if they are to avoid running out of time.

He was recently in the news for his heroics in the recently concluded ICC World Cup 2019 and will be seen in the upcoming T20I series against Sri Lanka.Neesham is regular in interacting with his fans on social media and somehow wins hearts with his responses and tweets. He got a lot of support from the fans, especially Indians after he urged the kids to not take up the sport following New Zealand heart-aching loss in the World Cup final to England.AdvertisementJimmy Neesham chooses teammate Ish Sodhi as his favorite Indian player Recently, Jimmy Neesham, who is in Sri Lanka for the three T20I matches series, took to Instagram for a session of Q&A on the social media platform. A fan from India asked the ever-witty all-rounder, to name his all-time favourite Indian cricketer. Neesham, who shares a good rapport with the Indian fans, went against the expectations of the person who asked the question, given he might have expected him to say, Kohli or Tendulkar.However, hilariously the Kiwi chose his teammate Ish Sodhi, the leg spinner as his favourite Indian cricketer ever. For those who don’t know, Ish Sodhi’s full name is Inderbir Singh Sodhi and he was born in Ludhiana, Punjab on October 31, 1992. His family moved to New Zealand when he was four years old and made his debut for the Black Caps in 2013 in a Test against Bangladesh.Technically, Jimmy Neesham is right in naming Sodhi as his favourite Indian player, given that Sodhi is Indian by birth. This is his unique way of trolling his fans on social media and keeping them in good spirits.However, Neesham has also been at the receiving end recently when he had made a joke regarding Virat Kohli saying that Rory Burns has more Ashes hundreds than the Indian captain has in his Ashes career.

3772,Hackers break fixed Tesla car bug that let them get in without key,"Security hackers from Belgian university KU Leuven revealed that a vulnerability found by them last year, which was fixed by Tesla, could still be exploited. They had broken the 40-bit encryption of a Tesla Model S key fob to get inside the car without using the original key. They now broke the updated 80-bit encryption by cracking two 40-bit keys.",Engadget,"Last year, researchers discovered a vulnerability in the Tesla Model S key fob that would've allowed thieves to clone it in just a couple of seconds. The automaker and the key fob's manufacturer, Pektron, created a new version that upgrades its 40-bit encryption to an 80-bit one to make it harder to crack. But now Lennert Wouters of Belgian university KU Leuven has revealed (as reported by Wired) that it's still possible to wirelessly crack the new key fob's encryption. Apparently, the vulnerability allows hackers to break the 80-bit encryption by cracking two 40-bit keys instead. The new attack has a shorter range than the first, and it takes a bit longer than a couple of seconds, but it's still doable. Model S owners don't have to worry about bad actors using the flaw to break into their cars, though -- all they have to do is upgrade their fobs. Tesla has already fixed the issue, and unlike last year, it doesn't require new hardware. The automaker has started rolling out an over-the-air software update for existing key fobs. In fact, it already implemented the change for all newly manufactured Model S vehicles last month, so new owners don't even have to upgrade. Wouters was impressed by the way Tesla handled the problem, but he warns that plenty of other cars' key fobs are vulnerable to similar encryption-cracking techniques. Especially since most automakers get their key fobs from third-party manufacturers, and some of them aren't capable of pushing over-the-air updates like Tesla is.As for Tesla, the automaker seems to be confident that its vehicles are secure enough. A spokesperson pointed out in a statement to Wired that the company introduced a PIN to Drive feature last year that gave owners a way to prevent anybody from driving their vehicles if they can't key in the right PIN.The spokesperson said:""While nothing can prevent against all vehicle thefts, Tesla has deployed several security enhancements, such as PIN to Drive, that makes them much less likely to occur. We've begun to release an over-the-air software update (part of 2019.32) that addresses this researcher's findings and allows certain Model S owners to update their key fobs inside their car in less than two minutes. We believe that neither of these options would be possible for any other automaker to release to existing owners, given our unique ability to roll out over-the-air updates that improve the functionality and security of our cars and key fobs.""",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/28/tesla-model-s-key-fob-clone/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Japan's biggest automaker will acquire 4.94% of Suzuki shares for about $907 million, while Suzuki will get a 0.2% stake valued at about $454 million in Toyota.",Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T) will take small equity stakes in each other, the Japanese car makers said on Wednesday, as they seek to develop newer technologies  and meet sweeping changes upending the global auto industry. The tie-up is the latest example of automakers chasing scale to manage costs and boost development. Car makers - especially smaller ones like Suzuki - are struggling to meet the breakneck growth of an industry transformed by the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), ride-hailing and autonomous driving. Toyota will pay around 96 billion yen ($910 million) for a 4.94% stake in Suzuki, while Suzuki will acquire in the market around 48 billion yen worth of shares in Toyota. That is equivalent to 0.2% of Toyota’s shares as of Wednesday’s closing price, before the announcement.  The companies said in a joint statement they intended to overcome challenges facing the industry by “building and deepening cooperative relationships in new fields while continuing to be competitors”. They said they would strengthen technologies and products in which each of them specialize in. The firms had said in 2016 they were exploring a partnership, citing technological challenges and the need to keep up with industry consolidation. Earlier this year they said they would produce EVs and compact cars for each other. Automakers around the globe have been joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology. Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles. Shares of Toyota and Suzuki closed little changed before the announcement. The deal brings Suzuki firmly into Toyota’ orbit, alongside Daihatsu Motor Co, Hino Motors Ltd (7205.T), Subaru Corp (7270.T), Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) and Yamaha Motor Co (7272.T). Rival Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) has an alliance with France’s Renault (RENA.PA), although that has been shaken following the ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, and with Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T). Honda Motor Co (7267.T) has a tie-up with General Motors Co (GM.N). Toyota has been looking to expand scale in next-generation technology and said this year it would offer free access to patents for EV motors and power control units. It believes that move would help it cut by as much as half the outlays for expanded electric and hybrid vehicle components in the United States, China and Japan.  Supplying rivals would greatly expand the scale of production for hardware. Suzuki, which specializes in affordable compact cars, had been struggling to keep pace with the huge costs of investing in research and development for automated driving functions. Toyota said in June it aims to get half of its global sales from electrified vehicles by 2025, five years ahead of schedule, and will tap Chinese battery makers to meet the accelerated shift to electricity-powered cars.

3780,China denies US warship request to visit Qingdao port,"China has denied a request for an American warship to visit the Chinese port city of Qingdao, the US Navy said. Earlier this month, China had also denied permission to two American warships to dock in Hong Kong. This comes amid the latest tensions between China and the US over the trade war and the protests in Hong Kong.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has denied a request for a U.S. Navy warship to visit the Chinese port city of Qingdao in recent days, a U.S. defence official told Reuters on Tuesday, at a time of tense ties between the world’s two largest economies. This marks at least the second time China has denied a request by the United States this month, having earlier rejected a request for two U.S. Navy ships to visit Hong Kong, as the political crisis in the former British colony deepened. The defence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the destroyer was supposed to visit on Sunday but China denied the request prior to that.  U.S. military warships have occasionally made visits to China, most recently in 2017, the defence official said. The last U.S. Navy ship to visit Qingdao was the destroyer Benfold in 2016. Asked why the U.S. request was denied, the U.S. defence official said the question should be directed to Beijing. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, said he had no understanding of the situation, and referred questions to the military. China’s Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment. A trade war between the world’s two largest economies has damaged global growth and raised market fears that the world economy could tip into recession.  But, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday raised hopes for a deal that could de-escalate the tariff war. Earlier this month, China denied a request by the U.S. Navy transport dock ship Green Bay and guided-missile cruiser Lake Erie to visit Hong Kong. The proposed visit would have taken place at a time when anti-government protests in Hong Kong are posing the biggest challenge China’s Communist Party rulers  since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012. Authorities in Beijing have sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible to subdue the violence. China’s 2019 defence spending will rise 7.5 percent from 2018, according to a budget report issued earlier this year, and its military build-up has raised concerns among neighbours and Western allies, particularly as Beijing has become more  assertive in territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas and over Taiwan, a self-ruled territory Beijing claims as its own. Last year, the U.S. military put countering China, along with Russia, at the centre of a new national defence strategy, shifting priorities after more than a decade and a half of focusing on the fight against Islamist militants.

People's Bank of China (PBOC) plans to issue the cryptocurrency, referred to as DC/EP (Digital Currency/Electronic Payment), reportedly through multiple Chinese banks. PBOC aims to cut the costs of circulating paper money and boost policymakers' control of money supply.",Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to issue its own cryptocurrency as early as Nov. 11, the country’s busiest shopping day for online sales, U.S. financial magazine Forbes said, citing two sources familiar with the matter. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been exploring the possibility of launching its own digital currency since 2014 to cut the costs of circulating traditional paper money and boost policymakers’ control of money supply. Some analysts say China appears to have accelerated the push to digital money after U.S. social media giant Facebook announced plans in June to launch digital coin Libra - the most high-profile proposed digital currency so far - within a year, a move that has shocked global policymakers and raised regulatory concerns. The PBOC plans to distribute its cryptocurrency through at least seven institutions in the initial stage, including Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent, China’s largest payments card issuer China UnionPay, and four Chinese state-owned banks, the report said, citing a source involved in the development of the cryptocurrency and a former employee of one of the institutions who is now an independent researcher. Paul Schulte, who worked as global head of financial strategy for China Construction Bank until 2012, was reported  saying the banks include China’s biggest lender the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China. The PBOC did not immediately reply to Reuters’ faxed request for comment. Alibaba declined to comment, while the other six institutions did not immediately provide any comment. Earlier this month, Mu Changchun, deputy director of PBOC’s payments department, told a forum the PBOC is “almost ready” to launch China’s own sovereign digital currency. The report added that the PBOC hopes its cryptocurrency will eventually be made available to spenders in the United States and elsewhere through relationships with correspondent banks in the West.

3806,Indian engineers built Ram Setu: HRD Minister at IIT Kharagpur,"Addressing the students of IIT Kharagpur during their convocation ceremony held recently, Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal claimed that Ram Setu was built by Indian engineers. ""It was built by our engineers and it amazes the world even today,"" he added. He went on to ask the students, ""Is it right? Please tell me, why are you silent?""",Times Now,"New Delhi: Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Monday claimed that the Ram Setu was an engineering marvel that was built by Indian engineers in ancient times and that “it amazes the world even today.”Pokhriyal revealed his theory on the “construction” of Ram Setu while addressing graduating students during the 65th convocation of IIT Kharagpur.“When we talk about Ram Setu, was it built by engineers from US, Britain & Germany? It was built by our engineers and it amazes the world even today,” Pokhriyal said during his address.   When his statement was met with silence from the audience, the Union minister reportedly asked them, “Is it right? Is it right? Please tell me, why are you silent?”He further added, “Our upcoming engineers must delve into its study. They must conduct fresh researches to find out the hidden truth about it.”
The Ram Setu Bridge, also known as Adam’s Bridge, is a chain of limestone shoals, submerged in the water, and is situated between Pamban Island - off the coast of Tamil Nadi - and Mannar Island, which of off the coast of Sri Lanka. The bridge separates the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Straight. As per Hindu mythological text 'Ramayana', the bridge or setu, was built by Lord Rama for his 'Vanara Sena' to cross the sea to reach Sri Lanka in order to rescue his wife Sita, who had been abducted by Lanka's evil king Ravana.In 2007, the Congress-led UPA had filed an affidavit with the Supreme Court in which it claimed that the structure was not man-made but “comprised 103 small patch reefs lying in a linear pattern with reef crest, sand cays and intermittent deep channels.”However, the government was later forced to withdraw the affidavit after it faced backlash from the Opposition who alleged that the Congress-led government had hurt Hindu sentiments.Notably, this is not the first time when Pokhriyal has made a questionable claim in his speeches. Recently, at a program at IIT Bombay, the HRD minister had claimed that Charaka, one of the key contributors to Ayurveda, was the first one to formulate a theory on the concept of the atom.Western history, on the other hand, states that it was Democritus who was responsible for the philosophy of the atom. Democritus was born more than a century before Charaka.

Levandowski was a founding member of the group that worked on Google's self-driving car project Waymo.",TechCrunch,"Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer and serial entrepreneur who was at the center of a trade secrets lawsuit between Uber  and Waymo, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on theft of trade secrets.The indictment, which is posted below, charges Levandowski with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets while working at Google, where he was an engineer and one of the founding members of the group that worked on Google’s self-driving car project. He is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael M. Cousins.If convicted, Levandowski faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution, for each violation, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office.Levandowski’s attorneys issued a statement on his behalf stating he is innocent of the charges.“He didn’t steal anything, from anyone,” the statement reads. “This case rehashes claims already discredited in a civil case that settled more than a year and a half ago. The downloads at issue occurred while Anthony was still working at Google—when he and his team were authorized to use the information. None of these supposedly secret files ever went to Uber or to any other company.”As a result of the charges, Levandowski has stepped down as CEO of his latest startup called Pronto AI, which is developing an advanced driver assistance system product for trucks called Copilot. Pronto AI was originally called Kache.ai, according to paperwork discovered at the time by TechCrunch, and was registered as a corporation with the California Secretary of State.Robbie Miller, Pronto’s chief safety officer, will take over as CEO, the company told TechCrunch.“The criminal charges filed against Anthony relate exclusively to lidar and do not in any way involve Pronto’s ground-breaking technology,” the company said in a statement. “Of course, we are fully supportive of Anthony and his family during this period.”The charges stem from Levandowski’s time at Google’s self-driving project, where he led its light detecting and ranging (lidar) engineering team, according to the indictment. The indictment alleges that in the months before his departure, Levandowski downloaded from secure Google repositories numerous engineering, manufacturing and business files related to Google’s custom lidar and self-driving car technology. Levandowski worked on the project from 2009 until he resigned from Google without notice on January 27, 2016.Levandowski left Google and started Otto, a self-driving trucking company that was then bought by Uber. Waymo later sued Uber for trade secret theft.Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber. The case went to trial, but was settled in February 2018. Under the settlement, Uber has agreed to not incorporate Waymo’s confidential information into their hardware and software. Uber also agreed to pay a financial settlement that included 0.34% of Uber equity, per its Series G-1 round $72 billion valuation. That calculated at the time to about $244.8 million in Uber equity.“We have always believed competition should be fueled by innovation, and we appreciate the work of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI on this case,” a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.An Uber spokesperson said the company has cooperated with the government throughout their investigation and will continue to do so.The prosecution is being handled by the Office of the U.S. Attorney, Northern District of California’s new Corporate Fraud Strike Force and is the result of an investigation by the FBI.“All of us have the right to change jobs,” said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson, “none of us has the right to fill our pockets on the way out the door.

At one stage, he took 538 wickets in five seasons at a very impressive average of 27.But eventually, even Cecil Wright has accepted that the time has come to pull up stumps on his career. “I wish I knew the reason for my longevity, but I couldn’t tell you what it is,” he told The Daily Mirror, who estimated that he had played in over two million games.‘Cec’ attributed the fact that his love for the traditional Lancashire food such as hot pot and him not drinking much alcohol barring an odd beer or two allowed him to remain fit and actively play the sport for this long. “And I keep fit, although these days I use my age as an excuse to miss training. I find keeping active helps to ease aches and pains. I don’t like to sit still and watch TV, I would rather have a walk or potter about in the garage,” said Wright.This once in a lifetime kind of cricketer will end his playing career on September 7, 2019, when he will represent Uppermill near Oldham against Pennine league side Springhead. His longevity is a very good example for the modern crop of professional cricketers.They can learn how to remain fit and active despite playing so many games. The demands of the modern-day cricket make it impossible for them to have extremely long careers but this story of Wright will certainly be an eye-opener and hopefully an inspiration for all playing the game.",https://www.crictracker.com/west-indies-veteran-cecil-wright-to-retire-from-cricket-at-the-age-of-85/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
3826,"ICC mocks Sachin Tendulkar with Stokes' comparison again, criticised","The ICC has been criticised for sharing its old tweet wherein it called Ben Stokes 'the greatest cricketer of all time' in a picture with Sachin Tendulkar. ""Told you so,"" the ICC wrote alongside the post. Reacting to it, a user wrote, ""It's a shame that ICC is tweeting such stuff."" ""Pathetic from ICC,"" wrote another.",CricTracker,"Time and again, the Twitter handle of the International Cricket Council faces the wrath from the fans for its controversial and cheeky tweets. During this year’s World Cup, the ICC faced the heat from the fans across the globe after it posted a photo of ‘King Kohli’, showing the India skipper sitting on a throne while dressed up like a king. The fans were not at all impressed with ICC’s special message for Kohli.Towards the end of the tournament, the handle once again made the fans lose their minds by calling Ben Stokes the greatest cricketer of all time while posting a photo of the England allrounder along with legendary Sachin Tendulkar. And on Wednesday, the ICC was at the receiving end once again for justifying their old caption which stated Stokes is the greatest of all time. The tweet came in the wake of Stokes’ heroic knock against Australia in the third Ashes Test.AdvertisementStokes singlehandedly won the game for his side by scoring an unbeaten century. England were reeling at 286 for 9 while chasing 359 and were looking set to end up on the losing side. But Stokes took the onus on himself to play one of the greatest innings of all time to power England to a series-leveling win. He launched a stunning counter-assault to leave the Aussies shell-shocked.The star all-rounder hit off-spinner Nathan Lyon for three sixes and followed that up by hitting Josh Hazlewood for four, six and six in three consecutive balls, during which point he passed his century. He eventually sealed the game by dispatching Pat Cummins for a four through the covers.Ben Stokes has been receiving praise from all around for his unbelievable knock. The ICC also decided to congratulate the all-rounder but did that in a cheeky manner. The ICC shared their old tweet where they called Stokes the greatest cricketer of all time with a fresh caption ‘told you so’.Unsurprisingly, the fans did not take long to hit back at the ICC as they reminded them of Tendulkar’s incredible record in the game.Here are some of the reactions:@BCCI plz take strict actions and suspend @ICC for his worthless tweets ????— A sarcaster (@a_sarcaster) August 27, 2019Courtesy : That Silly Carribean Umpire.— Mehran Mani????????

The world’s last male northern white rhinoceros, a 45-year-old named Sudan, died last year in Kenya, leaving only the two surviving female members of the species.  Najin and Fatu are Sudan’s daughter and grand-daughter and the three animals lived together at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, about 250km (155 miles) north of Nairobi, where Sudan died.  The scientists said in a statement they had harvested 10 eggs from Najin and Fatu and that seven of those had been successfully matured and artificially inseminated on Sunday. The team of scientists is led by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin.  The sperm used in the process had been harvested from two bulls of the same species and kept frozen.  “This is the next critical step in hopefully creating viable embryos that can be frozen and then later on transferred to southern white rhino surrogate mothers,” the scientists said.  “We were surprised by the high rate of maturation achieved as we do not get such a high rate...with southern white rhino females in European zoos.”  Kenya had 20,000 rhinos in the 1970s, but years of rampant poaching reduced the number to an estimated 650 now, almost all of which are black rhinos.

They (food aggregators) have more riding on it than us.

The robot has been sent to space on a 10-day mission to test new skills to assist astronauts.",TechCrunch,"A Russian Soyuz spacecraft docked with the International Space Station successfully late on Tuesday evening, after an initial attempt to do so didn’t end up working as planned on Saturday night. This second attempt went off without a hitch, however, and the capsule is now parked at a port on the Russian Zvezda module of the ISS. In the captain’s seat of the capsule, which is designed to carry human passengers, sat Skybot F-850, a humanoid robot built by Russia’s Roscosmos space agency.The robot didn’t actually pilot the craft — it was on an automated trip with no humans aboard to take over manual control. This trip saw the Soyuz launched atop a new version of Russia’s Soyuz rocket, which it has used so far only to transfer cargo with uncrewed spacecraft. This mission was designed to test the updated rocket with a Soyuz without humans on board, in preparation of using the same model with crew on board starting next year.The Skybot F-850 has a number of built-in sensors on board, and can measure things like G-forces exerted on passengers, as well as vibrations, temperature readings and more, to provide an accurate idea of what a human would experience were they the ones sitting in the vehicle’s passenger seats instead of the robot.This is the first use of a robot in this capacity by Roscosmos, and Skybot will remain at the ISS for around two weeks before it heads back to Earth. In addition to sensing conditions during launch, Skybot has some functions similar to your average Alexa speaker — it can answer questions, have short conversations and tell a few jokes. The plan, however, is to develop Skybot and its successors into more capable functional companions that can do activities in environments that are inhospitable to humans — including perhaps in the vacuum of outer space.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/russian-humanoid-robot-makes-its-way-to-the-international-space-station/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3854,Pak policy changed from taking Srinagar to saving Muzaffarabad: Bilawal,"Pakistani Opposition leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari criticised Pakistan PM Imran Khan over the handling of the Kashmir issue. ""Earlier, Pakistan's policy on Kashmir was on how we'll take Srinagar. Now after Khan's failure, our position has changed to focus on how we'll save [PoK's capital] Muzaffarabad,"" Bhutto said. Pakistani public can see Khan has failed in all aspects, he added.",The Financial Express,"Pakistan Opposition leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has slammed Prime Minister Imran Khan for his “complete failure” on handling the Kashmir issue, asserting that earlier Pakistan’s policy was how to take Srinagar from India, but now the concern is how to save Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK. Addressing media persons in Rawalpindi on Monday, Bilawal, the son of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, said Pakistan “lost Kashmir” due to the incompetency of the Khan government. “Earlier, Pakistan’s policy used to be how to take Srinagar from India. However, now due to the failure of Imran Khan government, the position is how we can save Muzafarabad,” the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman said.Bilawal said Prime Minister Khan knew that scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was in BJP’s election manifesto, but he did not take any action on this earlier. “This is a strategic blunder. The government does not have any excuse,” he told reporters outside the Adiala Jail, where his father and former president Asif Ali Zardari is lodged in connection with a corruption case. “When it comes to Opposition, Khan projects himself as lion, but in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi he is timid and becomes scaredy-cat,” he added.He said no other Pakistani government has failed so badly as the Khan government has. Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories, evoking strong reactions from Pakistan. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was an internal matter and also advised Pakistan to accept the reality.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

3863,"Roberts, Curtly feel Bumrah could've been a Windies pacer","Former West Indies pacers Andy Roberts and Curtly Ambrose stated that they feel Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah could have been a part of the bowling attack the West Indies team had during their time. ""[W]e never thought they could produce someone as lethal as Bumrah. He's the best Indian fast bowler I have seen,"" Roberts said.",Cricket Country,"Jasprit Bumrah‘s success against West Indies in the first Test at North Sound, which India won by a record 318 runs, has prompted two Caribbean fast-bowling greats to muse that the 25-year-old could have fit right into that iconic pace quartet of the 1980s.Andy Roberts, who claimed 202 wickets in 47 Tests, and alongside Michael Holding, Colin Croft and Joel Garner formed the most feared pace ensemble of all time, watched Bumrah stun West Indies with five wickets for seven runs on day four of the first Test and termed him “best Indian fast bowler I have seen”.And Curtly Ambrose, who took a total of 630 international wickets while striking fear in many opposing batsmen, felt that Bumrah “could have been one of us”.INDIA vs WEST INDIES FULL SCORECARD |  LATEST NEWS“India had Kapil Dev and some others, but we never thought they could produce someone as lethal as Bumrah. He’s the best Indian fast bowler I have seen,” Roberts told the Indian Express.“With Bumrah, the batsmen have little time to get into their mental rhythm. Look at everything else he does, he’s classical. He moves two balls into the batsmen, and the other one goes away. Then two away from him, and then one into him.”(READ: Jasprit Bumrah third-fastest Indian bowler to 50 Test wickets)That skill, according to Roberts, is what makes Bumrah – ranked No 1 in ODI cricket – a seriously special fast bowler.“This is how we did, this is how fast bowlers have operated over the years,” he said. “But the best one knows how, where and when to bowl. And Bumrah seems to have this awareness, which usually takes a lot of time to develop, a lot of experience. But how old is he? How many Tests has he played? He’s a quick learner, isn’t he?“To me, it has been the most striking feature of him. Some call it maturity. I call it game sense. There seems to be clarity in his thinking, and that automatically shows in his bowling. Some bowlers, very skillful ones, don’t develop it even 10 years after they had played the game. That’s the biggest thing for a fast bowler, to learn how to use your head.”(READ: In Jasprit Bumrah, India have a diamond in their armoury: Viv Richards)Ambrose felt that Bumrah had shades of his former new-ball partner and West Indies’ all-time leading wicket-taker, Courtney Walsh.“He’s good at varying his lengths, depending on the surfaces and batsmen,” he also told the Indian Express. “I saw that in the World Cup, how he adjusted his lengths according to the conditions and batsmen. That makes life difficult for batsmen … he reminds me a bit of Courtney (Walsh) a bit. He was wonderful in sizing up the length and bowling accordingly.”Amazed by Bumrah’s quirky action, Roberts felt he could have paired up with himself, Holding, Garner and Croft thirty years ago.“It’s the strangest action that I have seen on a cricket field,” he said. “I need to study that for a longer time to understand the mechanics of his action. But if he were born here back in our days, we would have had him. A freak was the only element missing in our bowling line-up. In fact, Bumrah is the only variety of bowler we had never produced. Then I don’t think even India would produce one like him again.”Ambrose, who took 405 wickets from 98 Tests, felt that Bumrah could have fit into any era.“At times, he rekindles memories of our prime,” he said. “The pace, aggression, the hostility, the craft. The way he outclasses the batsmen, the way he out-thinks them. He could have been one of us, he’s so complete a bowler that he could have played in any era.”India lead the two-match series 1-0.

Joint work is the new way of doing things.” On China:  “I think they want to make a deal very badly. I think that was elevated last night.” “China has taken a very large hit in the last few months. Three million jobs. It will soon be much more than 3 million jobs. Their chain is breaking up like no one has seen before. Once that happens it is very hard to put it back together. I think they very much want to make a deal.” “The longer they wait the harder it will be to put it back, if it can be put back at all.” On Iran: “They have to be good players, if you understand what I mean. They can’t do what they were saying they were going to do, because if they do that, they will be met with really very violent force. So I think they are going to be good.” On an Iran credit line:     “No we are not paying, we don’t pay,” Trump said. “But they may need some money to get them over a very rough patch and if they do need money, and it would be secured by oil ..., so we are really talking about a letter of credit.

3866,Iranian Prez rules out talks with US until sanctions relief,Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that he will not talk to the US until all sanctions imposed on Iran are lifted. US President Donald Trump on Monday said he was willing to meet his Iranian counterpart under the right circumstances. Tensions between Iran and the US rose after Washington pulled out from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal last year.,Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will not talk to the United States until all sanctions imposed on Tehran are lifted, President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump said he would meet his Iranian counterpart to try to end a nuclear standoff. Trump said on Monday he would meet Iran’s president under the right circumstances to end a confrontation that began when Washington pulled out of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. Trump also said talks were under way to see how countries could open credit lines to keep Iran’s economy afloat. Rouhani said Iran was always ready to hold talks. “But first the U.S. should act by lifting all illegal, unjust and unfair sanctions imposed on Iran,” he said in a speech broadcast live on state TV. Speaking at a G7 summit in the French resort of Biarritz, Trump ruled out lifting economic sanctions to compensate for losses suffered by Iran. “Washington has the key for positive change ... So take the first step ... Without this step, this lock will not be unlocked,” Rouhani said.   European parties to the deal have struggled to calm the deepening confrontation between Iran and the United States since Trump pulled Washington out last year.  French President Emmanuel Macron has led efforts to defuse tensions and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif flew in to the Biarritz G7 meeting unexpectedly on Sunday for side talks with French officials. Since ditching the deal last year, Trump has pursued a policy of “maximum pressure” to try to force Iran into broader talks to restrict its ballistic missile program and end its support for proxy forces around the Middle East. “Iran does not seek tension with the world. We want security in the Middle East. We want better and friendly ties with other countries,” said Rouhani.  Iran, which has slowly been breaching the nuclear deal in retaliation for U.S. sanctions, has threatened further violations in early September unless it receives sanctions relief. “We will continue to scale back our commitments under the 2015 deal if our interests are not guaranteed,” said Rouhani. The 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers, reached under former U.S. President Barack Obama, aimed to curb Iran’s disputed uranium enrichment program in exchange for the lifting of many international sanctions on Tehran. Iran has ruled out talks with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly its ballistic missile program that it says is defensive. It denies the missiles are capable of being tipped with nuclear warheads and says its nuclear program is peaceful. Rouhani said seeking nuclear bomb weapons was banned under a fatwa issued by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, referring to a religious decree issued in the early 2000s by Iran’s top authority that bans the development or use of nuclear weapons. “We have never wanted nuclear weapons because of our supreme leader’s fatwa,” said Rouhani.  Trump and Rouhani are both due to attend the United Nations General Assembly in September. However, any meeting between  Trump and Rouhani would have to be approved by Iran’s utmost authority Khamenei, who has the last say on all state matters.

3876,Sumit Nagal is going to have a very solid career: Roger Federer,"World number three Roger Federer said that 22-year-old Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal is going to have a very solid career. Federer's remark came after he defeated Nagal in four sets in the US Open first round. ""[It's] never easy to come out and play your best...on the big stage...I think he did that very well,"" Federer added.",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Roger Federer gave India’s Sumit Nagal a harsh introduction to Grand Slam tennis as the five-time champion weathered an early storm for a 4-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 win on Monday to reach the second round of the U.S. Open. When the match began it was Federer who surprisingly looked intimidated under the Arthur Ashe Stadium lights as he sprayed errors all around the court but the Swiss great woke from his slumber in time to turn the match resoundingly in his favor. “I thought I played like my beard today, I was rusty,” Federer, who was sporting a few days worth of stubble, said in his on-court interview.  “I’m going to clean it up for my next match.” World number 190 Nagal, who has never earned a tour-level victory and only qualified for the year’s final Grand Slam last week, came out swinging and even put a rare look of incredulity on the faces of those inside third seed Federer’s box. The 22-year-old Indian used impressive court coverage and sent heavily-spinning shots over the net during his dream start but his legs started to look more wobbly as the match wore and Federer righted the ship. Still, the start to the match for former world number one Federer, who is chasing his first New York title since 2008, could hardly have been worse as he made 19 unforced errors in the first set. Federer, playing in his first Grand Slam since he failed to convert two championship points on his own serve against Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon, was down 0-40 while serving for the match but won six of the next seven points to hold for the win. The 38-year-old Swiss only played two hardcourt matches in his leadup to the U.S. Open and admitted that he may have been a little rusty adjusting to the hardcourt but chose to focus on the positives. “Maybe it’s not a bad thing to go through a match like this. It was very similar at Wimbledon when I dropped the first set there, as well, in the first round,” said Federer. “At the end you look at the last three sets, and they were good. That’s encouraging.” After the match Federer heaped praise on his opponent for the performance he managed to deliver on one of the sport’s biggest stages. “Never easy to come out and play your best. Even though it’s kind of what you live for, you dream about, playing on the big stage. So I think he did that very well,” said Federer. “He knows what he can bring. That’s why I think he’s going to have a very solid career. “Up next for Federer, who is seeking a record-extending 21st career Grand Slam title, will be Bosnia’s Damir Dzumhur, who beat Frenchman Elliot Benchetrit earlier on Monday. Federer owns a 2-0 record in career meetings with Dzumhur, having beaten him in the third round at the 2015 French Open and in the first round at Wimbledon the same year.

After the scored were tied at the end of 50 overs and then again after the Super Over – during which Neesham batted – with nothing to separate the two teams, England were announced winners of the basis of a better boundary count.READ: – ‘Kids, don’t take up sport’: NeeshamShortly after the result, while some of the New Zealand players were able to get over it, Neesham expressed his disappointment and had tweeted, “Kids, don’t take up sport. Take up baking or something.

He has to be given equal opportunity. What’s the point of keeping him in the side, if you do not give him chance,” Kirmani questioned.ALSO READ: Rishabh Pant should play ahead of Wriddhiman Saha: Sourav Ganguly“We have to judge on pure performance. Saha came to Indian side following his consistency at domestic level.

There will be a time when he will retire, but we must stop talking about his retirement now.”Kirmani however wants Dhoni to groom the youngsters in the side before calling it quits.On the issue of Conflict of interest, Kirmani seemed to be on the same page with Justice Lodha panel’s verdict that there can’t be multiple sources of earning for any player.ALSO READ: Conflict of Interest rule has to be practical, Rathour’s case ridiculous: Ganguly“If anyone violates this clause, you’re liable to be questioned as it is conflict of interest.

""Players should know how to handle that freedom,"" Karunaratne further added.",Cricket Country,"Captain Dimuth Karunaratne was not happy with his batsmen’s lack of application against New Zealand in the second innings of the Colombo Test which Sri Lanka lost by an innings and 65 runs as the series ended 1-1.FULL SCORECARD: SRI LANKA vs NEW ZEALAND 2nd TESTNiroshan Dickwella had stated during the second Test how Karunaratne gives everyone the freedom to go out and express themselves and reflecting on that remark, the Sri Lanka skipper also went on to explain the importance of patience while batting.READ: He allows players to express themselves 100 percent – Dickwella on skipper Karunaratne“When I say players should be free, I don’t mean that you just hit every ball that you see,” Karunaratne said following the defeat. “It’s about keeping your mind free. If you at any time feel like you should play the reverse-sweep but you stop yourself, you’re restricting yourself. There are times when you can get runs from that shot, and when it’s a safe option. It’s about being relaxed.READ: Watling credits New Zealand success in subcontinent to self-belief“Freedom doesn’t mean swinging at every ball. It’s about playing with confidence. At times I felt our players really lacked patience. A Test is a very valuable thing, and batsmen should know how to play according to the situation. They should know how to handle that freedom.”New Zealand became just the fifth non-Asian side to inflict an innings defeat on Sri Lanka at home. Having won the first Test comfortably, Sri Lanka could have sealed the series 2-0 but a batting collapse in the second innings, which saw them lose the first five wickets for 32 runs, threw the game away. To make matters worse, with New Zealand spinners getting enough purchase, some of the shots played by the batsmen were questionable.“It was a pretty good wicket in the first innings, and we didn’t execute our shots very well,” Karunaratne said. “The batsmen probably thought it was going to be a good, flat wicket and so the application wasn’t there. Even me, after getting 60 [65], I played a rash shot [in the first innings]. It was a good wicket and you have to put up a good score on it. The Kiwis batted really well. They put up huge totals and put us under pressure.”But giving credit where it’s due, Karunaratne praised New Zealand for bouncing back after Sri Lanka had them 84/3. Colin de Grandhomme’s 83 and centuries from Tom Latham and BJ Watling lifted New Zealand to 431 for 6 before the declaration came.“We got the wickets of the first three batsmen quickly, and I think we thought the other wickets would also come easily,” he observed. “But they batted really well, and the pitch also dried out a bit, and the moisture that was there disappeared. It stopped seaming around. Despite that, I think we could have bowled better, and bowled tighter.“But on the second day New Zealand bowled really well, drying up the runs by bowling on one side of the pitch. Apart from Suranga Lakmal and Dilruwan Perera our bowlers don’t have much experience, but I think they’ve played enough first-class cricket to stack one side of the field and bowl to that.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/sri-lanka-vs-new-zealand-2nd-test-freedom-doesnt-mean-swinging-at-every-ball-dimuth-karunaratne-884986?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Baidu reportedly grew 3,700% by reaching a shipment of 45 lakh speakers in the quarter. The first place was retained by Amazon, which reportedly shipped 66 lakh units.",TechCrunch,"The global smart speaker market grew 55.4% in the second quarter to reach 26.1 million shipments, according to a new report from Canalys. Amazon continued to lead the race, accounting for 6.6 million units shipped in the quarter. Google, however, fell to the third spot as China’s Baidu surged ahead. Baidu  in Q2 grew a sizable 3,700% to reach 4.5 million units, overtaking Google’s  4.3 million units shipped.China’s market overall doubled its quarterly shipments to 12.6 million units, or more than twice the U.S.’s 6.1 million total. The latter represents a slight (2.4%) decline since the prior quarter.Baidu’s growth in the quarter was attributed to aggressive marketing and go-to-market campaigns. It was particularly successful in terms of smart displays, which accounted for 45% of the products it shipped.“Local network operators’ interests on the [smart display] device category soared recently. This bodes well for Baidu as it faces little competition in the smart display category, allowing the company to dominate in the operator channel,” noted Canalys Research Analyst Cynthia Chen.Meanwhile, Google was challenged by the Nest rebranding in Q2, the analyst firm said.The report also suggested that Google should introduce a revamped smart speaker portfolio to rekindle consumer interest. The Google Home device hasn’t been updated since launch — still sporting the air freshener-style looks it had back in 2016.

However, as a responsible industry body, we want to actively engage with these delivery aggregators to find a solution,” said Anurag Katriar, NRAI Mumbai chapter head.There is a lack of transparency, he added.The NRAI also pointed out that food ordering platforms do not share customer data with restaurants.Aggregators use the knowledge and power of the data to divert traffic under the guise of advertisement for their commercial benefit; it added in the letter.Katriar urging to resolve the issue further said that the body is not against the technology platforms, but its concerns are largely around these aggregators misusing their dominant position to indulge in predatory behaviour; commercially and informing the terms of engagement.The development follows days after the NRAI led the logout movement by restaurants across India from dining-membership driven apps such as Zomato Gold, Dineout and EazyDiner.NRAI, which represents 500,000 restaurants in the country, had jointly participated in the logout movement and threatened to do the same in other cities including Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru and Mumbai.",https://entrackr.com/2019/08/nrai-writes-to-food-delivery-firms/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

While YouTube  says the panels, which began rolling out in Western markets last year and is now live in 10 regions, is intended to provide more context about publishers, it is being criticized for not drawing a clear distinction between media that receives government funding, but are editorially independent, and ones that serve as government mouthpieces, like Xinhua News Agency or the China Global Television Network.Organizations like BBC, DW and NPR are completely independent from the government despite being state-funded.

It is not a comment by YouTube on the publisher’s or video’s editorial direction, or on a government’s editorial influence.”The panels will not be displayed in YouTube search results or affect the video’s features or eligibility for monetization.Last week, Google disabled 210 YouTube accounts that it said were used to spread misinformation about the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. Facebook and Twitter took action against accounts that they said were part of a propaganda campaign.Twitter also banned state-run media outlets from buying advertising on its platform after users spotted Xinhua News Agency using sponsored tweets to portray the demonstrations in Hong Kong, which have been mostly peaceful, as violent.

3935,10 get double life imprisonment in Kevin Joseph murder case,"The ten people who kidnapped and murdered Kevin Joseph in May 2018 have been sentenced to double life imprisonment by a court in Kerala. Kevin, a Dalit Christian man, was abducted by his wife Neenu's brother a day after the couple had registered their marriage. Neenu had told the court that her brother and father were against the marriage.",The News Minute,"Shanu Chacko and nine others who kidnapped and murdered young Kevin Joseph in May 2018 have been sentenced to double life imprisonment by Principal Sessions Court of Kottayam Judge C Jayachandran.All the accused - Shanu, Niyas Mon (Chinnu), Ishan Ismail, Riyas Ibrahimkutty, Manu Muraleedhara, Shifin Sijad, N Nishad, Tittu Jerome, Fasil Sherif and Shanu Shajahan - will have to serve two life terms on two charges: IPC section 364 A (kidnap and threat to kill) and Section 302 (murder).Kevin, a Dalit Christian man, was abducted on May 26, 2018 by Shanu Chacko, the brother of his wife Neenu. Kevin was found dead two days later on May 28. Neenu's father Chacko John (a Latin Catholic) and her brother had objected to the relationship. Shanu was enraged that Neenu had decided to marry Kevin and had abducted him along with his cousin Aneesh, from the latter’s home in Mannanam, just a few kilometres from Kevin’s house. All the accused have been asked to pay a fine of Rs 40,000 each. The judge said that out of the total amount collected, Rs 1 lakh would be given to Kevin’s cousin Aneesh, the prime witness in the case. Aneesh’s house was vandalised by the convicts while they kidnapped the duo. The rest of the money will be given equally to Neenu and Kevin’s father, Joseph.On August 22, the judge had declared that 10 out of the 14 fourteen accused were guilty and had acquitted four accused including Kevin’s partner Neenu’s father Chacko John.The judge had said that this was a case of honour killing and Neenu’s statement that her brother and father were against her relationship with Kevin as he was a Dalit had proved the same.The defence had appealed to take into consideration the age of all those convicted and the fact that none of them have a criminal background. This could perhaps be the reason for the court not delivering a death sentence despite calling it a rarest of rare case. According to a 2011 Supreme Court judgement by Justices Markandeya Katju and Gyan Sudha, ‘honour’ killing can be considered as ‘rarest of rare’ cases and deserving of death sentence.Background23-year-old Kevin was murdered a day after he and Neenu registered their marriage on May 25, 2018. On May 26, Kevin and his cousin Aneesh Sebastian were abducted from the former’s house in Mannanam. On May 28, two days later, Kevin was found drowned in the Chaliyakkara canal near Thenmala in Kollam. Kevin was a mechanic by profession. He was working in the Middle East and had come back to Kerala only a few months before his death.There were 113 witnesses in the case, including Neenu, Kevin’s cousin Aneesh (the prime witness), Aneesh’s elder brother Jossan J (Second witness) and Lijo, a neighbour of Neenu’s family (26th witness). Later, however, five witnesses turned hostile.Lijo, who is also a friend of Shanu Chacko, had allegedly been aware of the plot prior to the murder. His statement that Shanu had called him to say that Kevin had been killed proved crucial as it countered Shanu’s statement. Shanu had claimed that he did not kill Kevin as the victim had escaped from their custody and might have accidentally fallen into the water.Neenu had told the court that her father Chacko and her brother Shanu would not let her marry a Dalit.Read: Why the Kevin murder trial is a landmark in the battle against casteism in Kerala",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/justice-kevin-ten-convicts-sentenced-double-life-imprisonment-kerala-court-107892?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
3936,Chidambaram's lawyer denies non-cooperation charge in INX Media case,"Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram's lawyer and his Congress colleague Abhishek Singhvi on Tuesday denied that his client was not cooperating with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the INX Media case before the Supreme Court. Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who is also representing Chidambaram, accused the ED of ""leaking"" crucial documents in the case to the media.",Times Now,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard former finance minister P Chidambaram's petition challenging the Delhi HC's August 20 order that denied him anticipatory bail in the INX Media money laundering case that has been lodged by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Chidambaram's counsel and Congress colleague Kapil Sibal levelled a sensational charge against the ED, claiming that the probe agency kept the former FM ""in dark"". Sibal also asked the probe agency to ""produce the transcript of his interrogation"" of the last three days, and also accused the ED of ""leaking"" crucial documents in the case to the media. ""Statements made are admissible against the accused. Documents cannot be made part of the case diaries behind the back of the accused,"" Sibal said while concluding his argument. Questioning the alleged secrecy over interrogation by ED, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi - who is also representing the former FM in the court - also sought the transcripts of interrogation from the agency. Singhvi said, ""Let SC decide on the basis of answers.""Singhvi also denied the ""non-cooperation""  charge levelled against Chidambaram by the probe agencies. He also rejected the ED's charge that Chidambaram was a 'flight-risk'  and said that the court can 'keep his passport'.  A day after former finance minister P Chidambaram faced setbacks in court, the Supreme Court on Tuesday heard the Congress leader's plea challenging the trial court's August 22 order remanding him to CBI's custody till August 26 in the INX Media corruption case.  A bench of Justices R Banumathi and AS Bopanna heard the plea.  The former finance minister was confronted with former  NITI Aayog CEO Sindhushree Khullar in connection with the INX Media money laundering case in the Supreme Court for a second time in two days on Tuesday. During his interrogation in the court on Monday, the CBI had confronted P Chidambaram with  Khullar, who is a key witness in the FIPB approvals case. Khullar is supposed to have played a role in getting the approvals for the INX media case files. Reports suggested that the probe agency planned to confront the senior Congress leader with ex-NITI Aayog chief again on Tuesday. Former finance minister P Chidambaram's counsel and his Congress colleague Kapil Sibal said that the Delhi High Court - which had denied him bail in the case filed by the ED on August 20 - had simply ""copy-pasted"" the Enforcement Directorate's note in connection with the case and denied him anticipatory bail.Sibal reportedly said, ""Paragraphs in the High Court judgment were a verbatim copy of the CBI/ Enforcement Directorate note, comma by comma, full stop by full stop, word by word, sentence by sentence, the chart. Their notes become findings of the court. Where is the application of mind by the judge?On Monday, the trial court in Delhi extended Chidambaram's CBI custody by four days till August 30. The CBI had sought an extension of five days. During the hearing, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, appearing for CBI told the court, ""Chidambaram needs to be confronted with other co-accused. He was confronted with one co-accused during his custody, it is going on.. it will continue.""Meanwhile, the Supreme Court said that Chidambaram's plea challenging the Delhi HC's order denying him anticipatory bail in the CBI case was ""infructuous"" as he had already been arrested by the CBI. The case related to the alleged irregularities in the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crores in 2007 that occurred at a time when P Chidambaram was the finance minister. A corruption case was filed by the CBI in connection with the matter in 2017, while the Enforcement Directorate filed a money laundering case related to the matter in 2018. P Chidambaram is accused of facilitating the FIPB approvals for INX Media group when he was the Finance Minister, in lieu of favour for his son Karti Chidambaram’s businesses. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/p-chidambarams-bail-plea-hearing-today-news-updates-in-supreme-court-inx-media-case/476738?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

3941,N Korea developing warheads to penetrate missile defences: Japan,"North Korea appears to be developing warheads to penetrate ballistic missile shields defending Japan, the country's Defence Minister Takeshi Iwaya has said. Iwaya cited irregular trajectories of the latest missiles launched by North Korea. Notably, ballistic missile shields deployed by Japan are designed to counter projectiles on regular and predictable trajectories.",Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Pyongyang appears to be developing warheads to penetrate a ballistic missile shield defending Japan, the country’s defense chief said on Tuesday, pointing to the irregular trajectories of the latest missiles launched by North Korea. Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told a news conference Japan believes the rockets were a new short-range ballistic missile, according to a ministry spokesman who confirmed his comments carried by domestic media. Recent short-range missile tests by Pyongyang have stoked alarm in neighboring Japan even as U.S. President Donald Trump has dismissed the launches as unimportant. The United Nations Security Council discussed North Korea’s actions behind closed-doors on Tuesday at the request of Germany, France and Britain. The three countries condemned Pyongyang’s “repeated provocative launches” as violations of Security Council resolutions.  “International sanctions must remain in place and be fully and strictly enforced until North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs are dismantled. It is vital that the Security Council shows unity in upholding its resolutions,” Germany, Britain and France said in a joint statement after the meeting. Saturday’s test firings came a day after Seoul said it was ending a military intelligence-sharing pact with Tokyo, amid a worsening spat over wartime forced labor. Iwaya and other Japanese officials called Seoul’s decision “irrational” as the threat posed by North Korea grows.   Japan and the United States have Aegis destroyers deployed in the Sea of Japan armed with interceptor missiles designed to destroy warheads in space. Japan also plans to build two land-based Aegis batteries to bolster its ballistic missile shield. Those defense systems, however, are designed to counter projectiles on regular and therefore, predictable, trajectories, and any variation in flight path would make interception trickier.     Detailed analysis of the latest North Korean launches was underway with the United States, an official of South Korea’s defense ministry said on Tuesday.

""I think she'd agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential,"" he said. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham later clarified that Melania has never met Kim.",Reuters,"BIARRITZ, France (Reuters) - Melania Trump has never met Kim Jong Un, or even spoken to him, but U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that his wife has “gotten to know” the North Korean leader and, like him, believes in the reclusive country’s potential. Trump, who has met Kim three times since last year as he tries to persuade him to give up the North Korean nuclear weapons program, told a news conference at the G7 summit in France that he had come to know Kim “extremely well,” and suggested that his wife had too. “The first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un and I think she’d agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential,” Trump said, as Melania watched impassively from the audience. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham later clarified that Melania had never met Kim. “President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim – and while the First Lady hasn’t met him, the President feels like she’s gotten to know him too,” she told reporters. Melania did not accompany Trump to any of his three meetings with Kim, which took place in June last year in Singapore, in Hanoi in February, and on the border between North and South Korea in June. While Trump has developed a cordial relationship with Kim, and often speaks highly of him, there has been scant progress in the U.S. aim of getting North Korea to denuclearize.  Trump has said he and Kim agreed at their last meeting to resume working-level talks, but these have yet to happen and North Korea has conducted multiple missile tests since while accusing Washington of breaking a pledge to stop joint military exercises with South Korea.

India received 60 points for their victory against West Indies in first Test as the series has two matches, with each win worth 60 points. England got 24 points for their 1-wicket win over Australia as Ashes consists of five matches, with each victory worth 24 points.",CricTracker,"The international Test itinerary which kicked off post the ICC World Cup 2019 is an interesting one. Although teams are playing opponents in various corners of the globe, their series are all integrated since a specific point system is being followed in these games. It is because the ICC World Test Championship is underway and will continue till June 2021 when the final will be held in England to decide the formal champions in the longest format for the first time in its century-plus history.Teams like India, England, Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka have already bagged wins under the championship and picked up points. Virat Kohli’s side is at the top of the points table with the best ‘runs per wicket ratio’ of 2.338, thanks to their dominating 318-run victory over the West Indies in the first of the two-match series in Antigua.AdvertisementThe visitors had some early problems during batting in the first innings but man of the match Ajinkya Rahane’s solid batting performances in both essays and some terrific pace bowling saw India winning easily at the end. The win also made Kohli the joint most-successful Indian captain in Tests along with his immediate predecessor Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Chasing 419 to win the game, the hosts had no answer for India’s bowling firepower and were skittled out for 100.England also beat Australia by 1 wicket in the third Test of the ongoing Ashes series around the same time but while India got 60 points for their victory, England got only 24. While a section of the fans was confused as to what made the difference despite the two teams winning a Test match, it was all because of the championship’s format.Each series of the Test championship will have 120 points to fight for and they will be equally divided among the number of matches. Thus, India got 60 points because they are playing in a two-game series versus the Caribbeans while England and Australia have locked horns over a five-match series. England have 32 points in all at the moment since their second Test against Australia (who also have 32 owing to a win and draw) was drawn and the teams got eight points each. In India’s series, a draw will fetch 20 points.New Zealand and Sri Lanka also have 60 points each at the moment after their two-game series ended 1-1.

Jaitley became President of Delhi University Students Union in 1974.",The Wire,"New Delhi: Former Union Minister Arun Jaitley, who passed away on Saturday, was mentioned in the Delhi high court which observed on Monday that the country gets great leaders from students leaders and the university authorities should not be too harsh on them for their activities during students union elections.It stated this in its oral observations soon after dictating its order directing authorities to initiate civil and criminal action against candidates of Delhi University Students Union polls responsible for defacement of property.The court, which was dealing with a matter relating to defacement of public property during DUSU polls in 2017, said such things happen in polls.“Don’t be too harsh on them. Don’t put ban on everything. From student leaders, we sometime get great leaders for the country. You know the examples, you must have seen it yesterday,” a bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar said, in an apparent reference to Jaitley.Jaitley was an Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) student activist at Delhi University in the 1970s and became president of the University Students Union in 1974.The BJP stalwart died on August 24 at the All India Medical Institute of Sciences (AIIMS) where he was undergoing treatment following multiple ailments. His mortal remains were cremated on Sunday with thousands of admirers, BJP workers and leaders from across the political spectrum paying tributes.The court passed certain directions and disposed of a PIL by lawyer Prashant Manchanda, seeking a complete ban on defacement of public properties by the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) poll candidates.While dictating its order, asked the authorities to inform student leaders and union about the guidelines framed for regulating election campaigning for the student body polls to prevent defacement in future.The bench said the students should be warned about the orders passed by the court and thereafter, civil and criminal action should be initiated against those involved in damaging public or private properties, as per law.The petitioner had earlier placed before the court a ‘status report’ giving names of 15 persons who were involved in destruction of public and private property through use of spray paints and other means of defacement during the process of DUSU election in 2017.The court asked the Centre, the university and the police to keep in mind the last year’s direction to ensure there was no defacement of public property during the DUSU elections and wide publicity be given to penal consequences of such actions.The high court had earlier said prevention of defacement of property during student body polls in the DU was more important than taking action against candidates after they indulge in such activity.The court had suggested putting in place deterrents like disqualification of candidates to prevent defacement of property during the student body polls.It had also issued directions to the municipal corporations to be “vigilant” and remove any temporary hoarding or banner put up illegally without due caution and also take penal action, as such structures could result in harm to someone’s life.",https://thewire.in/politics/dusu-polls-hc-refers-to-jaitley-asks-varsity-not-to-be-harsh-with-student-leaders?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

We are ensuring that not even a single life is lost. Every Kashmiri life is precious for us. For us, the priority is to ensure that there should be no casualty, people can wait for ten days for restored telephone facilities. The region has seen strikes that went on for four months,"" he told ANI.The governor claimed that within 15 days there would be a visible improvement in the region. And to restore normalcy, the government will ensure absolute protection to people's lives, land and jobs.It may be noted that mobile network and landlines connections were snapped ahead of abrogation of Article 370 and 35A in the valley and the landline network is being restored in phases. However, following communication blackout, the administration has set telephone booths to facilitate communication.Malik also withdrew the invitation he extended to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to visit Kashmir and advised the latter to seek proper permission before scheduling any visit in the near future.""I want to put the matter pertaining to my invitation to rest.

He added, ""I love @englandcricket #ashes...Jack Leach is a legend."" England chased down the target of 359 to record their highest successful chase in Ashes cricket history.",CricTracker,"Did Ben Stokes have the magic wand in his hand? No, it was his bat. Wow! What an innings that was England’s superman Ben Stokes! He is having a magical 2019. After winning England a World Cup at Lord’s, the all-rounder was in the middle with the onus only on him to keep his team alive in the Ashes and yet again, he duly obliged. He scrapped early on for every run and at one stage had only scored 2 runs after facing 60 deliveries.However, it was the calm before the storm. At lunch, England were 238/4 with Jonny Bairstow playing a decent knock and even then, Stokes was just looking to survive not scoring many. But as the second innings started, Australia stormed back in the match and soon were in a winning position having reduced the hosts to 386/9. Jack Leach, the number 11, joined Stokes in the middle and this is where it all started.AdvertisementBen Stokes shifted the gears amazingly farming more strike and at times, not even going for a single until the last ball of the over.The southpaw connected a couple of strokes and suddenly the 20,000 spectators at the stadium and the whole of England started to believe. Some outrageous shots including a switch-hit six followed which brought the target within touching distance. It was all about nerves as the required runs came down to single figures (2 runs to be precise) and Jack Leach, having survived 10 deliveries bravely, misjudged a single.The Ashes was gone for England then. But there was drama in the middle. Nathan Lyon, Australia’s one of the best fielder, failed to collect the ball cleanly in order to run Leach out. Off the very next delivery, Ben Stokes went for the sweep and missed only for the ball to hit his back leg. The vociferous appeal followed and the batsman was plumb. But it was Stokes’ day. Joel Wilson didn’t raise his finger for some weird reasons and Australia had no reviews left.The very next ball, he smacked a backfoot drive through covers to seal a record run-chase for England and the crowd went berserk. After the victory, Ben Stokes himself was in disbelief finding difficult to come to the terms with what he had just done. Also, the same amount of credit should go to Jack Leack for scoring a greatest ever unbeaten 1-run knock.After soaking it all in, late on Sunday night, Ben Stokes took to his official Twitter to react for the first time after his heroics at Headingley. He duly credited Jack Leach for hanging out there with him during the record unbeaten 76-run stand and called him legend. “I fuc****(don’t care if I get fined) love Test Match Cricket and I love englandcricket #ashes @jackleach1991 is a legend,” Stokes wrote in his tweet.You were fucking fantastic.

Stokes, who was born in New Zealand's Christchurch, had helped England win the 2019 World Cup last month.",CricTracker,"A New Zealand-born cricketer Ben Stokes is having a crazy 2019. He first won England a World Cup from a hopeless position against his own country and then batted in absolute God mode to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat to keep his team alive in the Ashes at Headingley. Stokes has been in the middle for England at crunch situations and he has literally pulled them out of impossible positions to win single-handedly.If the World Cup final knock was the best of his career, the most supreme one was yet to come and the 28-year-old had saved his once in a life-time innings for the Ashes. England were down and out several times on the fourth day of the third Test and the urn was clearly in Australia’s dressing room when the ninth wicket fell. Rather he should’ve been out with two runs still needing to win.AdvertisementBut the umpire Joel Wilson thought differently and with Australia wasting the review only an over before that meant Ben Stokes was on the cusp of creating something special. Actually, the result wouldn’t have mattered in the end the way he’d played but it would’ve been a bitter ending to what was probably the best Test innings on par with Kusal Perera’s 153* in Durban Test earlier this year.The scenes at Headingley were superb after Stokes smacked a boundary through the covers to win England the Test match in a record chase. The crowd went berserk and so did Twitter as more than 1 lakh tweets flooded in for the all-rounder.While the world was is still coming to terms with Ben Stokes’ special innings in Leeds, Jimmy Neesham woke up to be shocked with yet another of the New Zealander’s heroics. The same man had crushed the Kiwis’ hopes of winning the World Cup for the first time at Lord’s with a brilliant knock. Stokes was even nominated for the New Zealander of the Year award which he duly rejected and also said that Kane Williamson deserves it the most and won some more hearts.Neesham has his own way of expressing himself on Twitter and he was once again at his best this time after knowing about Ben Stokes’ crazy outing at Headingley. Neesham wrote that it’s been a great month for a New Zealand-born all-rounder which is not him taking a dig at probably himself.Clearly, the World Cup loss is still hurting maybe as the left-hander was at the helm and only one shot away in the super over from winning the final for his team. But one has to tip his hat off for Neesham’s humour as every time he manages to bring a smile to his followers’ faces.",https://www.crictracker.com/its-been-a-hell-of-month-to-be-a-kiwi-born-all-rounder-jimmy-neeshams-hilarious-comment-after-ben-stokes-heroics/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4015,New pic by Chandrayaan-2 shows Moon crater named after Indian scientist,"ISRO on Monday shared a lunar surface image taken by the Terrain Mapping Camera-2 (TMC-2) of Chandrayaan-2 on August 23. The image showed craters such as Jackson, Mach, Korolev and Mitra. Notably, the Mitra crater on Moon is named after Padma Bhushan awardee late Indian Professor Sisir Kumar Mitra, known for his work in the field of radiophysics among others.",Times Now,"ISRO's second moon mission is now one step closer to the moon. In the latest series of images, the lunar surface has been imaged by the Terrain Mapping Camera-2 (TMC-2). The images were shot on August 23 from an altitude of 4,375 kms and are showing craters such as Jackson, Mach, Korolev, and Mitra (named after the name of Prof. Sisir Kumar Mitra).Jackson is an impact crater located in the northern hemisphere of the far side of the Moon. It is a 71 km dia crater at 22.4 degreed North and 163.1 degrees West. The interesting feature at the western outer rim of Mach crater is another impact crater, Mitra (92 km dia). It is named after Prof. Sisir Kumar Mitra, who was an Indian physicist and Padma Bhushan recipient known for his pioneering work in the field of ionosphere and Radiophysics. The Korolev crater seen in the image is a 437 km crater which has several small craters of varying sizes.Sommerfeld is a large impact crater located in the farside northern latitudes of the Moon. It is a 169km dia crater at 65.2 degrees North and 162.4 degrees West. It has a relatively flat interior surrounded by a ring mountain and a number of smaller craters lie along the rim edge. The crater is named after Dr Arnold Sommerfeld who is a German physicist pioneered in the field of atomic and quantum physics. Northeast to this crater lies the Kirkwood crater named after the American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood, another well-formed impact crater which is approximately 68 km diameter.  The Chandrayaan 2 was initially planned for July 15 launch which was cancelled at the last minute because of pressure issues in the helium tanks onboard the Geo Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV MK III). The launch then took place on July 22 and the spacecraft reached Earth's parking orbit soon after. The crucial process of taking up the soft landing of the lander 'Vikram' onboard the Chandrayaan 2 spacecraft that is currently in the lunar orbit will be taken up in the early hours of September 7, ISRO Chairman K Sivan said on Thursday. Scientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation in Bengaluru would be engaged in this process which is expected to be completed by 1.55 am, he told reporters at the airport here. ""It is expected to make a soft landing (on the surface of the moon) at around 1.40 am and completed by 1.55 am. At the global level, this is an important mission. It is being keenly watched by everyone,"" he said. Elaborating about the complexity involved, he said the speed of the spacecraft needs to be brought down to 'zero.'In a major milestone for India's second Moon mission, the Chandrayaan 2 spacecraft successfully entered the lunar orbit recently by performing Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) manoeuvre. The second Lunar bound orbit manoeuvre for the spacecraft was successfully performed on Wednesday. There will be three more orbit manoeuvres to make the spacecraft enter into its final orbit passing over the lunar poles at a distance of about 100 km from the Moon's surface.ISRO has said subsequently the Vikram lander will separate from the Orbiter (on September 2) and enter into a 100 km X30 km orbit around the Moon. Then it will perform a series of complex braking manoeuvres to soft-land in the South polar region of the Moon. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/chandrayaan-2-beams-new-moon-images-shows-jackson-mach-korolev-mitra-and-more-craters/476357?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Siddaramaiah went on to say that the Janata Dal Secular (JDS) leader considered him an enemy which ultimately led into the downfall of Congress-JDS government in the state.Pinning the blame on Kumaraswamy for the recent collapse of the Congress-led coalition government in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah said, ""That is what happens when people are unable to run the government"". The Congress leader also said that it was Kumaraswamy's ""vengeance"" against him that his government couldn't function properly.The former Karnataka Chief Minister also aimed guns at the recently formed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state accusing it of coming to power through the back door by adopting immoral means such as horse-trading.

They are threatening them and then there are many disgruntled within BJP too. Hence portfolio allotment is not happening,"" added Siddaramaiah.It should be noted that it has been six days since the Yediyurappa-led Cabinet was expanded, however, portfolios are yet to be allotted to the leaders.Earlier on Sunday, HD Kumaraswamy had clarified that he never called Siddaramaiah his first enemy.

4045,Our bowlers are ensuring our line-up's formidability: Sehwag,"Praising Team India's fast bowling unit which took 18 wickets in the first Test match against West Indies, ex-India cricketer Virender Sehwag said ""these bowlers"" are ensuring that India is a formidable line-up. ""It's good to see the way these bowlers are bowling,"" the 40-year-old added. India registered a 318-run win over West Indies on Sunday.",Cricket Country,"The Indian bowling attack led by Jasprit Bumrah has had world cricket sit up and take note and another example was dished out by the pacer and gang at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Sunday when they decimated West Indies for 100 in their second innings after plundering 343/7 declared, to set the hosts a target of 419. It was once again the clinical show of the bowlers that stood out on a wicket that didn’t really have any demons in it.Speaking to IANS, former India opener Virender Sehwag said that it is the consistent show of the bowlers in recent times that has made the Indian outfit world beaters and the No.1 ranked Test team.“It is not that we didn’t have quality bowlers before. In my time we had the likes of Javagal Srinath, Ashish (Nehra) and Zaheer Khan and its great to see the way Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and the likes of Umesh (Yadav) — he has been around for a long time — have performed. It is good to see the way these bowlers are bowling — and ensures we are a formidable line-up,” he said.Interestingly, while India decimated West Indies in Antigua on Sunday, Ben Stokes played a blinder in Leeds to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the Ashes for England. While he was one of the most destructive openers of his time, Sehwag has always had a special place in his heart for Test cricket and he believes that such performances are definitely brilliant advertisements for Test cricket and the World Test Championship that started with the 2019 Ashes.Also Read: Kohli stresses on pacers’ workload management and best team combination“The championship has come at the right time is what I feel. When there are such exciting matches (Ashes) it will be great to have the Test Championships. This will be great for the playing nations and for the format… more exciting and more competitive,” he pointed.At a time when the injury to Steve Smith has had the world talking about protection and how the ICC might wish to look at ways to ensure the safety of players, Sehwag feels that the bowlers also deserve to get some leeway as the rules have already handed batsmen quite an advantage as pacers can bowl only two bouncers in an over in the long format.“I never used the chest pad in my life… So I don’t think I need to use neck pads. Batsmen have the bat in hand, helmet on head, what more do you need? Let’s give something to the bowlers,” he said.The batsman, who was once in the news for his alleged differences with regular skipper M.S. Dhoni, feels that the current stories around Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are figment of imagination of the media.“I think these are all media created. They bat together and chit chat when they are at the crease; they also talk to each other when they are fielding in the slips… so I don’t see any enmity or fight there. Its all created by you guys,” he signed off.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/present-indian-bowlers-ensure-that-we-are-a-formidable-line-up-virender-sehwag-884612?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4048,Class is permanent and form is temporary: Amre on Rahane,"Former Indian cricketer Pravin Amre lauded India's Test vice-captain and centurion in Antigua, Ajinkya Rahane, saying, ""We all know that class is permanent and form is temporary and he has shown that once again."" ""As a player he has been contributing on and off, even if he didn't score a hundred,"" Amre added about Rahane.",Cricket Country,"West Indies folding up for 100 in the second innings in Antigua on Sunday was as much about India‘s brilliant bowling as it was about failing to grind it out on a surface that wasn’t most conducive to batting. And that is what made Ajinkya Rahane‘s century even more special in the third innings of the game. And personal coach Pravin Amre hopes that this will finally silence the critics.Speaking to IANS, Amre said that Rahane keeping calm and not going for an exaggerated celebration after reaching his century showed a mature side as also the confidence that the Test deputy has in his own game.“He has handled himself really well. While everyone speaks about his knock in the Johannesburg Test match that won India the game, not many realise that the vice-captain had been dropped at the start of the series. He isn’t frustrated and that shows the confidence he has in his game. That also showed when he got to his hundred. He spoke to himself and there was no exaggerated celebration. Any other batsman would have jumped in the air and done quite a few things.“For me, his first innings score of 81 was more important because India were in a spot of bother at 25/3 and when two big batsmen like Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara are back in the hut, there can be immense pressure. You needed someone to bat and hold fort and that is just what he did. I don’t think nobody can handle the situation better than him on days when Kohli and Pujara are out cheaply. He has the technique and the temperament to adapt to situations,” Amre pointed.While it is no secret that bowlers like Ishant Sharma have improved by leaps and bounds by playing County cricket, Amre feels his ward has also benefitted by playing in tough conditions against the Dukes ball.Also Read: Playing county games for Hampshire helped: Ajinkya Rahane“I must say the last two years weren’t very easy for him and the way he got the Man of the Match on Sunday was very important. But if you see the last six months, his hardwork was there for all to see. He went to England, played County cricket and did his best against the Dukes ball which isn’t easy and then he went to Bengaluru (National Cricket Academy) for a week and trained there as well. I think it is a reward for the hardwork that he put in,” he smiled.The coach feels that Rahane has once again proved to the world that form is temporary and it is all about having the class to stand the test of time at the international level.“We all know that class is permanent and form is temporary and he has shown that once again. This was a very crucial knock and God has been kind. But when I as his coach analyse it, I feel that he played some quality knocks last year as well, be it in South Africa or England and he has as much contribution in India becoming the No.1 Test team. As a player he has been contributing on and off, even if he didn’t score a hundred.“Milestone isn’t always important and contributing to the team’s success as this is a team game. Not for once did he doubt his ability and that was the reason why he managed to stand tall and score 183 runs in the Test match. He was dropped even during the Indian Premier League and he came back and made a statement with the bat,” he said.In fact, Amre believes that Rahane should have been there in the team during the 2019 World Cup as well.“Even during the World Cup, if he was there at No.4, things would have been different because I honestly believe that he has a role in the team when they are playing in conditions like those in England,” he signed off.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/pravin-amre-lauds-centurion-ajinkya-rahane-says-last-two-years-werent-easy-for-him-884663?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He added that Tata will continue investing in its luxury car unit Jaguar Land Rover, the sales of which recently saw a decline amid the automobile sales' slump in India. ""We need to wait for the market to recover,"" he further said.",The Financial Express,"Natarajan Chandrasekaran refuses to be hobbled by the slowdown. The chairman of Tata Sons believes that while looking for ways to combat the downturn, one must also keep an eye out for opportunities and work to cash in on them. Chandrasekaran says the Tata Group will not hesitate to invest, whether it is in the existing businesses or in focus areas such as digital, consumer and retail. Excerpts from an interview with Shobhana Subramanian:What is the group’s strategy for the next five years in the context of the current slowdown in the economy?As I have been saying, we need to take the slowdown in our stride, we cannot afford to be bogged down by it. We are guided by the long-term opportunity, whether at home or overseas, and must work towards that. Right now, we need to see how best we can operate in the current environment. We will certainly grow and we will most certainly continue to invest wherever we feel there is a need to do so. In a nutshell, we need to become more efficient. And as we go along, we will also explore new business opportunities.In particular, what will be the approach to the automobile business?The commercial vehicles business is sound and we need to wait for the market to recover. In the passenger vehicles space, we will start looking at a range of electric vehicles (EVs). That is not so say we will phase out IC cars, both will co-exist. If we want to be a meaningful EV player with market share, it can’t be done with one or two models, we will need to roll out several. We will continue to invest in JLR and grow the business. The auto industry globally is facing a number of headwinds like China, Dieselgate, Brexit, etc. We need to tackle these external challenges by focusing on what we can do.Could you give us a sense of the areas where the group believes there is potential?We can’t give away too much at this point because we have just started the work. What I can tell you is that we are very excited about the digital space and have created a new company to explore this opportunity — Tata Digital. This should not be a very capital-intensive business and we will leverage our in-house strengths. We are working on several platforms in both the B2C and B2B spaces.How much is the group looking to invest in the next few years?It’s hard to put a number at this point, we will invest whatever is necessary. As a keen follower of technology, how are you reading the evolution of fintech?So, the payments segment is moving quickly while the lending side is not as fast. That is understandable since this is a new area and lenders need to be comfortable with the process. Also, there needs to be a strong connect between the physical and digital infrastructure.

Not many would have given England a chance of winning the Test after they were reduced to 286 for 9 while chasing 359.With 73 runs needed and Australian bowlers in fine rhythm, it looked nothing less than mission impossible for England. But Stokes took the onus on himself to play one of the greatest innings of all time to power England to a series-levelling win. He launched a stunning counter-assault to leave the Aussies shell-shocked.AdvertisementHe hit off-spinner Nathan Lyon for three sixes and followed that up by hitting Josh Hazlewood for four, six and six in three consecutive balls, during which point he passed his century. With 17 needed to win, Stokes was dropped by a diving Marcus Harris.

As soon as Stokes hit the winning runs, the cricketing world went crazy and rightly so. And while Stokes was getting all the attention, Leach was rightly lauded for his brave knock too.Soon after the win, the official sponsors of the series, Specsavers took to Twitter too to put a cheeky message about Leach. “Does anybody know Jack Leach’s agent?

Facebook (FB.O) is trying to get Washington on its side after the social media company shocked regulators and lawmakers with its announcement in June that it was hoping to launch a new digital coin called Libra in 2020.

Existing investors Sequoia Capital, Beenext venture capital fund and Insight Partners also participated in the round. The new round valued the startup at $225 million, Ashneer Grover, Co-founder and CEO of BharatPe, told TechCrunch.",TechCrunch,"BharatPe,  a New Delhi-based firm that is enabling hundreds of thousands of merchants to start accepting digital payments for the first time, and is also giving them access to working capital, has raised $50 million as it looks to scale its business in the nation.The Series B round for the one-year-old startup was led by San Francisco-headquartered VC firm Ribbit Capital  and London-based Steadview Capital, both of which have previously invested in a number of financial services in India.Existing investors Sequoia Capital, Beenext Capital and Insight Partners also participated in the round, pushing BharatPe’s all-time raise to $65 million. The new round valued the startup at $225 million, Ashneer Grover, co-founder and CEO of BharatPe, told TechCrunch in an interview.Google and Amazon, both of which offer payment services in India, were also in advanced stages of talks to fund BharatPe’s Series B financing round, but the startup’s founding team was not keen on diluting their stakes, especially in the wake of BharatPe’s recent growth, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.BharatPe operates an eponymous service to help offline merchants accept digital payments. Even as India has already emerged as the second largest internet market, with more than 500 million users, much of the country remains offline. Among those outside of the reach of the internet are merchants running small businesses, such as roadside tea stalls.To make these merchants comfortable in accepting digital payments, BharatPe relies on QR codes built as part of government-backed UPI payments infrastructure. “We get them to put up a QR code in their shops, and any customer that uses a UPI-powered payments app — which is now supported by nearly every payments app in India — can pay these shop owners digitally,” said Grover.Through BharatPe, these merchants also get access to a simplified dashboard on their phones to track the customers who owe them money and get periodic reminders.BharatPe has amassed more than 1.5 million merchants on its platform. It processes more than 21 million transactions a month, worth more than $83 million, Grover said.BharatPe also allows merchants to secure short-term loans. New merchants can secure about $500 for a period of three months from BharatPe. As merchants spend more time on BharatPe, the firm increases the amount to about $2,000.The lending business is crucial to BharatPe. Payment apps make little to no money through making transactions on their platforms. Those processing UPI payments can not even charge a small commission to merchants. “There is no money to be made in doing payments in India,” Grover said. So you charge small interest on loans.Access to working capital is a major challenge in developed markets such as India. According to a World Bank report, more than 2 billion people globally do not have access to working capital.Grover said BharatPe aims to use the fund to add about 3.5 million merchants in the next 12 months. The firm has more than 2,000 sales people who are adding 400,000 new merchants to BharatPe each month, he said.The rest of the money will go into financing the loans on the platform and building new solutions. Later today, BharatPe will launch a new service to connect suppliers and merchants through BharatPe so that their accounts are in sync.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/india-bharatpe/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

4072,Russia finds radioactive isotopes in test samples after accident,Russia's state weather agency has found radioactive isotopes in test samples after an accident during a test at a military site earlier this month. The accident caused a brief rise in radiation levels in the nearby city of Severodvinsk. President Vladimir Putin later said the mishap occurred during testing of what he called promising new weapons systems.,Reuters,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s state weather agency said on Monday it had found the radioactive isotopes of strontium, barium and lanthanum in test samples after a mysterious accident during a test at a military site earlier this month. The deadly accident on Aug. 8 caused a brief rise in radiation levels in the nearby city of Severodvinsk. President Vladimir Putin later said the mishap occurred during testing of what he called promising new weapons systems.  A cloud of inert radioactive gases formed as a result of a decay of the isotopes and caused the brief spike in radiation in Severodvinsk, the weather agency said in a statement. The isotopes were Strontium-91, Barium-139, Barium-140 and Lanthanum-140, which have half-lives of 9.3 hours, 83 minutes, 12.8 days and 40 hours respectively, it said.      Russia’s state nuclear agency has said five of its staff members were killed and three injured in a blast during a rocket test on a sea platform that involved “isotope power sources”.  U.S.-based nuclear experts suspect the incident occurred during tests of a nuclear-powered cruise missile. Norway’s nuclear test-ban monitor said on Friday that the explosion that killed the scientists was followed by a second blast two hours later and that this was the likely source of a spike in radiation.  The second explosion was probably from an airborne rocket powered by radioactive fuel, the Norsar agency said - though the governor of Russia’s Arkhangelsk region, where the blast took place, dismissed reports of another blast.

4073,Iran says it has sold oil from tanker released by Gibraltar,"Iran has sold the oil from a tanker released by Gibraltar after weeks in the custody of British Royal Marines, an Iranian government spokesman said on Monday. However, he did not identify the recipient of the oil. After the tanker's release, the US had said it would take every action it could to prevent it from delivering oil to Syria.",Reuters,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran has sold the oil from a tanker released by Gibraltar after weeks in the custody of British Royal Marines and the vessel’s owner will decide on its next destination, IRIB news agency quoted an Iranian government spokesman as saying on Monday. Separately, Tehran - embroiled in a spiraling confrontation with Washington over U.S. sanctions meant to strangle Iranian oil exports - announced that it had deployed a naval destroyer with cruise missiles to help secure Iranian ships. The Iranian government spokesman did not identify the recipient of the oil carried by the Adrian Darya tanker. After Gibraltar freed the vessel on Aug. 18, the United States said it would take every action it could to prevent it delivering oil to Syria in contravention of U.S. sanctions. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has sold the oil of this ship and now the owner and purchaser of this oil will decide the destination of the cargo,” government spokesman Ali Rabiei said. Refinitiv Eikon shipping data showed on Monday that the tanker was no longer recorded as bound for Turkey, its indicated destination at the weekend. No new destination was given. The tanker’s location is currently south of mainland Greece, west of the island of Crete, the data showed. The vessel, laden with 2 million barrels of oil, had previously been heading to the port of Kalamata in southern Greece after its release by Gibraltar. But Greece said it would not offer any facilities to the vessel. The ship, whose name was changed from Grace 1 during its detention off Gibraltar, was released after a five-week standoff over whether it was carrying Iranian oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions. Soon after the detention order was lifted, a U.S. federal court ordered the seizure of the vessel on different grounds, but that petition was rejected by Gibraltar. Iran said any U.S. move to seize the vessel again would have “heavy consequences”. The U.S. government said it wanted the tanker detained anew on the grounds that it had links to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, which Washington has designated a terrorist organization. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to bar all Iranian oil sales since withdrawing from world powers’ 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, saying the pact was flawed and must be renegotiated to impose stricter limits on Tehran. Tensions have since escalated in the Gulf region, with explosions that damaged six tankers in May and June, Iran’s shooting-down of a U.S. surveillance drone and its seizure of a tanker flying the flag of U.S. ally Britain last month.  Iran’s state-run Press TV said the newly deployed destroyer was equipped with long-range cruise missile systems and had been dispatched to the Gulf of Aden to provide security for Iranian ships traveling through the region. Press TV said the ship, which it described as Iran’s most advanced destroyer, would be accompanied by a logistical vessel and a helicopter carrier.

4074,Taliban says deal with US won't end attacks on Afghan forces: Report,"Amid talks between the US and Taliban to secure the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, a Taliban commander has said a deal will not mean an end to attacks on Afghan forces, according to a report. ""We will...seize power by force,"" the report quoted him as saying. US negotiators have been pushing the Taliban to agree to intra-Afghan talks.",Reuters,"KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - As U.S. and Taliban negotiators push to wrap up talks aimed at securing the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, disagreement remains about whether a pact will mean an end to the insurgents’ fight with the U.S.-backed Afghan government. U.S. and Taliban officials have been negotiating in Qatar since last year on an agreement centered on the withdrawal of U.S. forces, and an end to their longest-ever war, in exchange for a Taliban guarantee that international militant groups will not plot from Afghan soil. U.S. negotiators have been pressing the Taliban to agree to peace talks with the Kabul government and to a ceasefire, but a senior Taliban official said that would not happen. “We will continue our fight against the Afghan government and seize power by force,” said the Taliban commander on condition of anonymity. U.S. President Donald Trump is impatient to get U.S. forces out of Afghanistan and end the 18-year war that was launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. But there are fears among Afghan officials and U.S. national security aides that a U.S. troop withdrawal could see Afghanistan plunged into a new round of civil war that could herald a return of Taliban rule and international militants, including Islamic State, finding a refuge. Another Taliban commander, who also declined to be identified, said a deal was expected to be signed this week under which U.S. forces, which provide all-important air support to Afghan troops, will stop attacking the Taliban and the militants would end their fight against the U.S. troops. Under the pact, the United States would also cease supporting the Afghan government, the Taliban officials said. “The Americans will not come to the assistance of the Afghan government and its forces in their fight against us,” the first Taliban official said. Zalmay Khalilzad, the veteran Afghan-American diplomat who has been leading negotiations on the U.S. side, however rejected the suggestion that U.S. forces would no longer support the Kabul government, saying “no one should be intimidated or fooled by propaganda”. “Let me be clear: We will defend Afghan forces now and after any agreement with the Talibs,” he wrote on Twitter in reaction to the Reuters report. He added that  “All sides agree Afghanistan’s future will be determined in intra-Afghan negotiations,” he said. The disagreement highlights one of the most sensitive issues surrounding the U.S.-Taliban talks - a resentment among many in the Afghan government that they have been sidelined from talks that will decide the future of their country. It also raises a question over whether the Taliban leadership will be able to impose any peace agreement on field commanders who may be reluctant to give up fighting when they feel on the brink of victory. The Taliban, fighting to expel foreign forces and re-establish a theocratic Islamic state since their ouster in October 2001, have refused to talk to the government, denouncing it as a U.S. puppet although they have raised the possibility of negotiations after the deal on the U.S. withdrawal is struck. The militants now control more territory than they have since 2001 and the war has ground into a stalemate with casualties rising among civilians as well as combatants. Some 14,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, training and advising Afghan forces and conducting counterinsurgency operations.  About 17,000 troops from NATO allies and partners make up a  NATO-led train, advise, assist mission called Resolute Support in Afghanistan. Out of those, about 8,000 are from the United States with the others from other NATO members and partners. The Taliban are demanding the withdrawal of all foreign forces.  In a statement on Monday, the hardline Islamist group accused Salaam, a telecoms company owned by the Afghan government, of spying and warned it would treat its offices, employees and installations as military targets.  In June, the Taliban gave Afghan media a week to cease airing anti-Taliban announcements paid for by the government. There has been no let-up in the fighting over the past year despite the talks. The United States had not stopped conducting air strikes and helping Afghan forces to destroy camps run by the Taliban and Islamic State fighters, a U.S. official said.  At least 3,812 civilians were killed or wounded in the first half of 2019 in the war against militant groups, including a big increase in the number of casualties caused by government and foreign forces, the United Nations said in July. Two diplomatic sources with knowledge of the ninth round of talks in Qatar said they expected an agreement to be finalised this week, enabling the U.S. to pull out about half its forces. An end to the fighting between the Taliban and Afghan government forces would have to be negotiated separately, they said. “A ceasefire between the Afghan forces and the Taliban requires a separate agreement and deliberations are yet to begin,” said one diplomat who has monitored the Qatar talks. “The U.S.-Taliban agreement will stop U.S. from conducting air strikes on the Taliban, and the Taliban will stop insider attacks on the U.S. and other foreign soldiers,” the diplomat said. One Western diplomat said preparations were being made for talks between the rival Afghan sides in Norway. A group of at least 30 Afghans had been identified by the government and its allies to talk to the Taliban. Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban political office in Doha, said negotiations had gone on late into Sunday. The two sides would meet again later on Monday after internal talks in the morning, Shaheen said. “Our meeting with the U.S. team will resume in the early evening,” he said. Most issues had been resolved but a formal agreement had yet to be concluded, he said.

As of Sunday, President Jair Bolsonaro had authorised military operations in seven states to combat the fires. The response comes as leaders of countries in the Group of Seven (G7) nations currently meeting in France expressed grave concerns over the fires.",Reuters,"BRASILIA/PORTO VELHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian warplanes are dumping water on the burning forest in the Amazon state of Rondonia, responding to a global outcry over the destruction of the world’s largest tropical rain forest. As of Sunday, President Jair Bolsonaro had authorized military operations in seven states to combat raging fires in the Amazon, responding to requests for assistance from their local governments, a spokeswoman for his office said. Reuters accompanied a firefighting brigade near the state capital of Porto Velho, where there were areas larger than football fields that had been charred, but active fires were contained to small areas of individual trees.  The dozen or so yellow clad firefighters from environmental enforcement agency Ibama easily cleared brush from around a burning stump with a leaf blower, doused it with jets connected to water packs mounted on their backs and covered it in earth.  A video posted by the Defense Ministry on Saturday evening showed a military plane pumping thousands of gallons of water out of two giant jets as it passed through clouds of smoke close to the forest canopy. The response comes as leaders of countries in the Group of Seven (G7) nations currently meeting in France expressed grave concerns over the fires. French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday said the G7 was nearing a deal to provide “technical and financial help” to countries affected by the Amazon fires. Nearly 80,000 fires have been registered across Brazil through Aug. 24, the highest since at least 2013, according to space research agency INPE.  Bolsonaro announced the military would be sent in on Friday after several days of criticism from the public and world leaders that Brazil’s government was not doing anything to fight the fires. He also said on Twitter he had accepted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s offer of a plane and specialized support for the firefighting operations, following a call between the two leaders. But outside of Rondonia, the government had yet to provide any operational details for other states. The Defense Ministry said in a briefing on Saturday that 44,000 troops were available in Brazil’s northern Amazon region but did not say how many would be used where and what they would do. Military personnel around Porto Velho appeared to be largely coordinating firefighting efforts, according to a Reuters witness. Asked for additional details, the Defense Ministry told Reuters in a statement that in all seven states that have asked for help, the military is planning operations to support firefighting initiatives already underway. Justice Minister Sergio Moro had also authorized a force of military police to assist in fighting the fires, with 30 set to be sent from Brasilia to Porto Velho. The president’s office posted to Twitter a photo of police officers on a plane bound for Rondonia set to arrive at noon. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles posted a video showing a caravan of yellow fire prevention trucks and other government vehicles, saying they were on the ground responding in Rondonia.  Colombian President Ivan Duque said on Sunday he would seek a conservation pact with other Amazonian countries - first in bi-lateral meetings in Peru this week and then at the United Nations General Assembly. “Colombia wants to lead a pact, a conservation pact, between the countries that have Amazon territory,” Duque said after meeting with an indigenous community in the Amazonian city of Leticia in southern Colombia. “We must understand the protection of our Mother Earth and our Amazon is a duty, a moral duty.” The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rain forest and is seen as vital to the fight against climate change because of the vast amounts of carbon dioxide that it absorbs. The Amazon, which provides 20% of the planet’s oxygen, is home to an estimated one million indigenous people from up to 500 tribes as well some three million species of plants and animals, including jaguars, sloths, giant otters, river dolphins, howler monkeys, toucans, reptiles, frogs and insects.    Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre said he worries if 20-25% of the ecosystem is destroyed that the Amazon could reach a tipping point, after which it would enter a self-sustaining period of dieback as the forest converts to savannah. Nobre warned that it is not far off with already 15-17% of the rain forest having been destroyed.

The Indian pacer has played only 11 matches in his short Test career.4 – Four out of five wickets Jasprit Bumrah claimed in the 2nd innings were via bowled. He thus became the first Indian pacer to dismiss four batsmen “bowled” in a Test inning.Earlier during the World Cup last month, Bumrah’s four wickets against Bangladesh were via “bowled”. He then became the first Indian pacer with four bowled dismissal wickets in an ODI.5/7 – Bumrah conceded only seven runs during his 5-wicket haul; the joint 4th fewest runs conceded by any bowler for a Test five-fer. This is also the cheapest 5-wicket haul by an Indian in the longer format. Bumrah bettered Venkatapathy Raju’s 6/12 against Sri Lanka during the 1993 Chandigarh Test.2 – Windies lost their 5th wicket at the score of 15 and were further reduced to 37/7. These are the 2nd lowest scores for the Windies at the fall of 5th and 7th wickets in a Test inning. They were 14/5 in the last year’s Bridgetown Test against Sri Lanka and 36/7 against Pakistan during the 1986 Faisalabad Test.3 – India got each of Windies’ top five for single digits in the 2nd innings. This is only the 3rd instance of them dismissing opposition’s top five for single figures in a Test inning. Pakistan’s first innings during the 1999 Kolkata Test and South Africa’s first innings during the 2015 Nagpur Test were the other two such instances.In fact, only Roston Chase got into double digits among Windies’ top 8 in their 2nd innings; the second instance of 7 out of opposition’s top eight getting out for less than ten runs in a Test inning. Seven out of Windies’ top 8 were dismissed for single digits during the first innings of the 1987 Delhi Test match.38 – Ishant Sharma’s 38 wickets in Test cricket in the Caribbean Islands are the 4th most for a visiting pacer. Ali Fraser (54) and Glenn McGrath (50) claimed 50 wickets while Imran Khan has 48 of them.18 – Number of wickets picked up by Indian pacers in this Test; the joint-most by them in a Test match in West Indies. As many as 18 wickets went to Indian pacers in the 1997 Bridgetown Test match. In the Windies’ 2nd innings of that Test, all the ten wickets were picked by the pacers. It was the only instance of all ten wickets taken by Indian pacers in a Test innings in West Indies prior to this Test.",https://www.crictracker.com/windies-vs-india-2019-1st-test-day-4-bumrahs-record-5-fer-indias-biggest-win-kohlis-milestone-win-and-more-stats/

4101,Iran's Zarif leaves France after surprise visit to G7 Summit,"Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif left France after paying a surprise visit to the G7 Summit. He held more than three hours of talks, including with French President Emmanuel Macron, before heading back. Zarif flew in for side talks at the Summit as host France ramped up efforts to ease tensions between Iran and the US.",Reuters,"BIARRITZ, France (Reuters) - Iran’s foreign minister made a flying visit for talks with host France at the G7 summit on Sunday, as Paris ramped up efforts to ease tensions between Tehran and Washington, a dramatic diplomatic move that the White House said had surprised them.   European leaders have struggled to tamp down the brewing confrontation between Iran and the United States since Trump pulled Washington out of Iran’s internationally-brokered 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the Iranian economy. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who is under U.S. sanctions, flew to the southwest French town of Biarritz where the Group of Seven leaders are meeting. He held more than three hours of talks, including with Macron, before heading back to Tehran.  “Road ahead is difficult. But worth trying,” Zarif tweeted, adding that in addition to meeting French leaders he had given a joint briefing to officials from Germany and Britain. French officials sought to bill the meeting as important to “refine Iranian propositions” to help defuse the crisis after G7 leaders had discussed Iran over dinner on Saturday. “The discussions that were held between the president and Zarif were positive and will continue,” a French official said after the meeting, declining to take detailed questions.  The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers aimed to curb Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of many international sanctions on Tehran. Since pulling Washington out of the deal last year, Trump has pushed a maximum pressure policy to try to force Iran into a new negotiation that would include its ballistic missile program and regional activities. While Trump’s European allies also want new talks with Iran, they believe the nuclear deal must be upheld. Macron, who has taken the lead in Europe in trying to salvage the agreement and avert a deeper crisis in the Middle East, had already met Zarif in Paris on Friday. They discussed proposals to de-escalate tensions between Washington and Tehran, including easing some U.S. sanctions or providing Iran with an economic compensation mechanism to make up for oil revenues lost under U.S. sanctions. But despite Macron spending two hours with Trump over lunch on Saturday and all seven leaders discussing Iran at length in the evening, it did not appear that the U.S. leader had budged on easing oil sanctions as Macron had sought from Trump.  A European diplomat familiar with the discussions said the leaders had failed at the dinner to persuade Trump. Earlier on Sunday Trump appeared to brush aside French efforts to mediate with Iran, saying that while he was happy for Macron to reach out to Tehran to defuse tensions, the United States would carry on with its own initiatives. Trump and Macron are scheduled to hold a joint news conference at 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) on Monday at the conclusion of the summit, the White House said.  Macron’s invitation to Zarif had caught Trump by surprise, a White House official said, and no U.S. officials met with Zarif during the visit.  Other delegations also said they had been informed at the last minute. The Elysee said delegations had been informed, but everything had happened very quickly. U.S. authorities earlier this month placed Zarif under U.S. sanctions.  “Zarif will convey the Iranian leadership’s response to French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal aimed at saving Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal,” a senior Iranian official had told Reuters. In response to the tougher U.S. sanctions and what it says is the failure of European powers party to the deal - France, Britain and Germany - to compensate it for lost revenues, Tehran has responded with a series of moves, including retreating from some of its commitments to limit its nuclear activity. Highlighting just how difficult it will be ease tensions, two Iranian officials and one diplomat told Reuters on Sunday that Iran wants to export a minimum of 700,000 barrels per day of its oil and ideally up to 1.5 million bpd if the West wants to negotiate with Tehran to save the nuclear deal. One of the Iranian officials also said Iran’s ballistic missile program was not open for negotiation. “We’ll do our own outreach, but, you know, I can’t stop people from talking. If they want to talk, they can talk,” Trump said earlier when asked about Macron’s mediation efforts. The United States has made no indication it will ease any curbs and it is unclear what kind of compensation mechanism Macron wants to offer Iran, given at this stage a proposed trade channel for humanitarian and food exchanges with Iran is still not operational. Macron has also said that in return for any concessions he would expect Iran to comply fully with the nuclear deal and for Iran to engage in new negotiations.  “It’s unprecedented and given the context it’s pretty audacious,” said a French diplomatic source.

He has scored five half-centuries and a century in his last 15 innings in the whites and according to many, he should’ve played ahead of Hanuma Vihari. But Ajinkya Rahane, after Day 1, confirmed that the team combination led to India’s limited-overs vice-captain being left out of the team.AdvertisementIndia went only with four bowlers in the Antigua Test and Vihari’s ability to roll his arm over might be the reason for him being favoured ahead of Rohit.Mohammad Azharuddin highlighted his recent in the longest format and felt he should’ve been in the playing XI for the series opener against the Windies.

He is such a good player and does well in ODIs also. So he deserves a long run in the Tests.“Rather he can open the innings also. KL Rahul has also got so many chances. He was rather sent back from Australia due to his performances. He is so inconsistent. So Rohit should’ve played and if you pick such a big player then you should play him and respect him,” Azhar said while speaking to Aaj Tak.India’s position in the ongoing Antigua Test is strong at the moment and even Vihari scored well in the first innings stitching a decent partnership.

Notably, Gates added $14.2 billion to his net worth this year.",Times Now,"New Delhi: Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft Inc, has earlier retained the world’s richest person title for almost 20 years and may well be on the threshold of reclaiming it yet again. Last year itself, the propelling share prices of Amazon steered Jeff Bezos to top the 'world’s rich' list. Jeff Bezos has briefly piped Bill Gates in 2017, while he finally surpassed Gates to become the world’s richest person in 2018. The net worth of almost all the billionaires is largely derived from their equity interests, either in their own company or a pool of other enterprises or a proportionate mix of both.According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bill Gates controls a net worth of $105 billion, whereas Jeff Bezos commands a net worth of nearly $109 billion as of August 25, 2019. Notably, Bill Gates has added as much as $14.2 billion in his net worth, and, on the other hand, Jeff Bezos has lost about $15.7 billion in the present calendar year 2019.As per the present net worth estimates by the Bloomberg, Bill Gates is just $4 billion away from becoming the world’s richest person, provided the net worth of Jeff Bezos either stays around the level of $109 billion or below it. At the end of September 4, 2019, Jeff Bezos held a net worth of $168. A drastic reduction in Jeff Bezos’ net worth was witnessed in April this year when it fell to $115 billion from $150 billion in a single day.The net worth is constituted by collating various assets and reserves held by the person. With equity being a major portion, the net worth keeps variating with the change in the market prices of the assets held. A phenomenal change in the net worth can also be observed due to the change in the quantum of assets. There are a number of instances when the promoters and equity holders willingly sell off a definitive proportion of their stake. In the present month itself, Jeff Bezos has offloaded Amazon shares worth nearly $3 billion.",https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/article/bill-gates-net-worth-jeff-bezos-4-bln-away-from-becoming-the-worlds-richest-person-as-jeff-bezos-net-worth-dips-16-bln-in/475735?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Although announcements have been made about adopting the technology, officials are tightlipped about the funding needed for the project to take off.Bengaluru is the only other city in the country to adopt data from Google Maps to manage traffic signals.Hyderabad's ITMS project in limbo for 3 yearsThe Hyderabad traffic department’s decision to switch to a dynamic signalling system comes at a time when its implementation of the Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS) is marred by delays.The ITMS is an automatic signal system controlled by a common control centre. The system was to help the city manage its traffic by automating signals, identify water-logging areas through sensors during monsoon, inform commuters about alternate routes and curb traffic violations.Traffic department officials say the work for the project has been going on from 2017. The cable laying work for the project has not even begun in some parts of the city, say officials from two of the three police commissionerates in the city.At present, the city’s traffic signals are timed at three minutes, 120 seconds and 90 seconds. The ITMS, using its sensors, would calculate the volume of vehicles passing through a junction and then recommend changes to the signal timings. The dynamic signals using traffic data from Google go a bit further, as it helps make real-time changes to traffic signals depending on the traffic volume.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hyderabad-traffic-dept-use-google-maps-real-time-data-manage-signals-107797?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Rashford had recently come out to condemn the racial attack on Paul Pogba after the French midfielder had missed a penalty in United's 1-1 draw against Wolves last week. The England international himself ended up on the receiving end after his spot-kick hit the edge of the bar against Palace.United had released a statement condemning the abuse of Pogba after their draw against Wolves. The club had also called for Twitter and other social media platforms to take action against the users who posted demeaning tweets about the midfielder. However, Twitter was once again flooded with hate comments for Rashford, who couldn't convert a penalty won by Scott McTominay in the 70th minute of the game.United fans at Old Trafford put out a banner reading ‘United against racism,' standing up against racism during the game against Palace. However, social media, as usual, was brutal on the players after the club suffered their first-ever defeat against Crystal Palace in the Premier League. It was a game fairly dominated by Manchester United, who enjoyed significantly more possession and had more attempts on the goal but were far from clinical.Palace, on the other hand, defended solid and finished their chances well. It was Jordan Ayew, who scored the opener for Palace in the 32nd minute after Jeffrey Schlupp found him with a slick pass allowing the forward to run past the United's defence before slotting it past David De Gea calmly to put Palace in front.After a dominating second-half display, United managed to break the deadlock through Daniel James, who equalised in the 89th minute with a classy finish but Patrick van Aanholt was quick to cut short United's brief celebration as his close-range finish in the stoppage-time secured a 2-1 win for Palace.It was the first win for Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson at Old Trafford in the Premier League as United slipped to the fifth spot on the points table with just 4 points after three games.

4141,Uber's extra $1 'safe rides fee' in US was pure margin: NYT reporter,"Uber's $1 'Safe Rides Fee' on UberX rides in the US, introduced in 2014, was a pure margin to each trip, The New York Times reporter Mike Isaac has claimed in his book, quoting employees who worked on the project. Uber had claimed the fee will be used for background check process and development of safety features in the app.",TechCrunch,"It’s hard at times not to feel sorry for Uber  CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, given all that he inherited when he became the rideshare giant’s top boss back in April 2017.Among his many to-do items: take public a money-losing company whose private-market valuation had already soared past what many thought it was worth, clean up the organization’s win-at-all-costs image and win over employees who clearly remained loyal to Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, an inimitable figure who Khosrowshahi was hired to replace.Things are undoubtedly about to get worse, given the fast-upcoming publication of a tell-all book about Uber authored by New York Times reporter Mike Isaac. In just one excerpt published yesterday by the newspaper, Isaac outlines how Uber misled customers into paying $1 more per ride by telling them Uber would use the proceeds to fund an “industry-leading background check process, regular motor vehicle checks, driver safety education, development of safety features in the app, and insurance.”The campaign was hugely successful, according to Isaac, who reports that it brought in nearly half a billion dollars for Uber. Alas, according to employees who worked on the project, the fee was devised primarily to add $1 of pure margin to each trip.Om Malik, a former tech journalist turned venture capitalist, published a tongue-in-cheek tweet yesterday after reading the excerpt, writing, “Apology from @dkhos coming any minute — we are different now.”Malik was close. Instead of an apology, Uber today sent out a mass email to riders titled, somewhat ominously, “Your phone number stays hidden in the app.” The friendly reminder continues on to tell customers that their “phone number stays hidden when you call or text your driver through the app,” that “pickup and drop-off locations are not visible in a driver’s trip history,” and that “for additional privacy, if you don’t want to share your exact address, request a ride to or from the nearest cross streets instead.”The email was clearly meant to reassure riders, some of whom might be absorbing negative press about Uber and wondering if it cares about them at all. In fact, Uber has sent out a handful of emails relating to safety features since late March, when a college student was murdered after mistaking a car for her Uber ride. As for the timing, the company insists that today’s email is “unrelated” to the excerpt that was published yesterday — that it’s coincidence that it has advertised some of its traditional safety features to riders on the heels of a widely read report about the company’s apparently fraudulent “safe rides” campaign of several years ago.Perhaps so, but the company can’t assume riders are piecing together a campaign from a handful of emails sent over many months that most will not open. And taken on its own, what today’s missive mostly accomplishes is to remind customers that riding in an Uber involves life-and-death risk.Uber stressing it’s “committed to safety” without added context is the debating equivalent of a so-called negative pregnant, wherein a denial implies its affirmative opposite. It’s Uber shooting itself in the foot.More broadly, the affair underscores the tricky terrain Uber is left to navigate right now. Though campaigns like “safe rides” were orchestrated under the leadership of Kalanick — who did whatever it took to scale the company — they are Khosrowshahi’s problem now.So is the fact that the company’s shares have been sinking since its IPO in early May; that Uber’s cost-cutting measures will be scrutinized at every turn (outsiders particularly relished the company’s decision to save on employees’ work anniversaries by cutting out helium balloons in favor of stickers); and that Uber appears to be losing the battle, city by city, against labor activists who want to push up the minimum wage paid to drivers.And those are just three of many daunting challenges that Khosrowshahi has been tasked with figuring out  (think food delivery, self-driving technologies, foreign and domestic opponents). No doubt Isaac’s book will highlight plenty of others.How Uber handles the inevitable wave of bad publicity that comes with it remains to be seen. We don’t expect Khosrowshahi to come out swinging; that’s not his style.But we also hope the company doesn’t continue emailing riders without doing more to explain why. It’s great if Uber is taking customer safety more seriously than it might have under Kalanick’s leadership. Randomly reaching out to tell riders how to remain safe from their Uber drivers isn’t the way to do it, though, especially without acknowledging in any way why it’s suddenly more eager to have the conversation.Update: An earlier version of this story did not include feedback from Uber; the piece has been amended to reflect the company’s comments.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/24/uber-tries-to-reassure-customers-that-it-takes-safety-seriously-following-nytimes-book-exerpt/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""This is not Yemen, this is not the 1970s, that you can deny basic rights to an entire people and nobody will say anything about it,"" he added.",The Wire,"New Delhi: An officer of the Indian Administrative Service from Kerala, Kannan Gopinathan, has resigned from the prestigious service in order to be able to speak freely about the virtual ‘Emergency’ that he says has been imposed on the people of Jammu and Kashmir ever since the Centre announced it was ending the state’s special constitutional status.“This is not Yemen, this is not the 1970s, that you can deny basic rights to an entire people and nobody will say anything about it,” Gopinathan told The Wire. “It has been 20 days since there has been a lockdown on a whole region with all kinds of restrictions. I cannot remain silent over this even if this means I have to resign from the IAS in order to speak freely and that is what I have done.”The irony is that Gopinathan, who joined the IAS in 2012, is attached to the Arunachal-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territory cadre, and might eventually have gone as an administrator to Jammu and Kashmir now that the state has been demoted to the status of a UT.He is currently attached to the government of Dadra and Nagar Haveli but sent in his resignation on Wednesday, August 21.“I did not intend to say anything publicly till after my resignation was accepted,” said Gopinathan, but word leaked when colleagues with whom he shared the news in a social media group informed the media in Kerala.Speaking to The Wire, Gopinathan said that the constitution allows for the imposition of a state of emergency (and the suspension of freedoms) if there is external aggression or armed rebellion, but in Kashmir, people’s freedoms have been curtailed on the grounds that if they are not, then there could be an internal disturbance. In any case, after the 44th amendment to the constitution, an ‘internal disturbance’ is no longer grounds for the imposition of emergency.“Of course, unlike the Emergency, there has been no [formal] proclamation. Everything has been left to executive orders by IAS officers! And though people are not barred from seeking judicial remedies, the courts do not appear keen to act”.File photo of Kannan Gopinathan from the days of his posting in Mizoram. Credit: Facebook page of Kannan Gopinathan.Gopinathan is particularly concerned about the manner in which Shah Faesal, the former IAS topper who resigned from the IAS in January 2019, has been arrested. A habeas corpus petition was moved at Delhi high court on August 19. Though such petitions are normally considered urgent, the court said it will only take the matter up on September 3.The officer said that though he had been growing disillusioned with the civil service for some time –  especially with the politician’s expectation that civil servants only concern themselves with implementing instructions and not bother to analyse what is morally right or wrong – the unacceptable situation in Kashmir had forced his hand. “If I owned a newspaper, my headline tomorrow would just be the word ’20’ because it is the twentieth day that the people of Kashmir have been subjected to these restrictions on their freedoms.”Asked what his plans are now that he has quit the service, Gopinathan said, “I have not thought that far. But twenty years from now, if people ask me what I was doing when a virtual Emergency was imposed like this on a part of the country, at least I will be able to say that I resigned from the IAS.”",https://thewire.in/government/this-is-not-the-1970s-ias-officer-quits-in-anguish-over-kashmir-emergency?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""[T]o have the courage and the belief to come back each and every time and to continue working hard is the hallmark of a true legend,"" read part of a user's tweet.",Times Now,"India's ace shuttler PV Sindhu stormed into her third successive finale at the BWF World Championships with a straight-set win over China's Chen Yu Fei (21-7, 21-14) on Saturday. Hence, she was up against her old nemesis and fierce rival in Japan's Nozomi Okuhara in a bid to claim her maiden gold in the championships in Basel. In a contest that stretched merely for 37 minutes, Sindhu dominated from the onset and created history to become the first-ever Indian shuttler to claim gold in the championships. She emerged on top of Okuhara by 21-7, 21-7.Interestingly, Sindhu had come face-to-face with (the now 24-year-old) Okuhara in 2017 final as well, but couldn't get the better of the opponent at that time. But this time around, Sindhu was up for the challenge and her remarkable improvement overall was evident from the beginning. She attained the lead from the initial phase and gave no breathing space to Okuhara, who looked a pale shadow of herself. As a result, frustrations crept inside the Japanese player but Sindhu didn't let up on her assault. Highlights | @Pvsindhu1 fulfills a perfect week in Basel securing the first world title of her career

Talking about match statistics, the 24-year-old Indian shuttler led 8-2 in terms of most consecutive points won. She was relentless in long rallies as well. In total points played (56), Sindhu ended with a 42-14 scoreline; depicting her sheer dominance.This was Sindhu and Okuhara's 16th meeting overall. Now, the head-to-head tally reads 9-7 in favour of the Indian. Sindhu's confidence level had gone up with her remarkable come-from-behind win over former world number one, Tai Tzu Ying, in the quarterfinals. She was a game behind but bounced back in style. Hence, she managed to stamp her authority in the finale in no time riding on the momentum.After the match, an elated Sindhu stated, “I am proud of the fans here, thanks for their support. Thanks to my coach Kim [Ji Hyun] and Gopi sir and all the support staff. And I dedicate this award to my mom, it’s her birthday today. Happy birthday, mom”, says the first Indian Badminton World Champion. The crowd then sang happy birthday for her mother! WHAT-A-MOMENT!!!Sindhu, in turn, is now trending on Twitter with many sports personalities wishing the shuttler for her glorious achievement. After several missed opportunities (where she settled for bronze and silver), the youngster has finally answered her critics in a memorable fashion. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/badminton/article/pv-sindhu-creates-history-becomes-first-ever-indian-to-claim-gold-in-bwf-world-championships-with-dominating-win-over-japans-nozomi-okuhara/475752?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4154,KL Rahul disappointed in not having converted starts,"Indian batsman KL Rahul, who registered scores of 44 and 38 in the ongoing first India-Windies Test, said that he was very disappointed after not having converted his starts into big scores. ""[T]here are a lot of things I'm doing right. Just need to keep my head down and show some patience,"" Rahul added.",Cricket Country,"India‘s grip on the first Test against West Indies in Antigua has been tightened after the tourists extended their lead to 260 with seven wickets in hand by the close of play on Saturday, but one man knows that he should have been batting at stumps.KL Rahul scored 38 off 85 balls before he was bowled by the offspinner Roston Chase in an all-advised sweep shot, in which he exposed all three stumps in an attempt to paddle the ball around the corner.In India’s first innings, Rahul had got to 44 from 97 balls and was dismissed when getting a thin edge on a glance down the pads of Chase.INDIA vs WEST INDIES FULL SCORECARD |  LATEST NEWSThese two dismissals to Chase at North Sound mean that of his 58 innings in Test cricket, 20 have been between 10 and 49. Speaking to reporters at the end of day three, Rahul admitted he was bitterly frustrated at two aborted starts.“Very disappointed, but there are a lot of things I’m doing right, lot of positives too. I just have to keep my head down and show some more patience,” he said. “I just have to prolong the good things I’m doing till I get to 35 or 45.“I’ve been batting well, I’ve looked comfortable in both the innings, my head space and everything is very good. I’m happy about a lot of things, just if I can keep my patience and keep batting the way I do in the first 60-80 balls, if I continue to do that for 200-250 balls then it’ll obviously benefit me and the team. That’s what I’ll look to do next match.”(READ: Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli strengthen India’s grip on Antigua Test)Eight months ago when India last played Test cricket, Rahul batted five times in Australia and scored 57 runs, of which 44 came in one innings. Around that knock which promised so much more, he made  2, 2, 0 and 9.With some World Cup runs to his name, Rahul was named as opener alongside Mayank Agarwal for the first Test against West Indies despite a Test batting average of just over 23 since the start of 2018.Asked whether his problems were technical, Rahul dismissed such notions and said it was a matter of confidence.“Technique and everything is over-rated – when you get runs everything looks good,” he said. “So it was important for me to spend time in the middle, I never felt that there was anything drastically wrong with my technique in Australia. It was just one of those phases that every batsman goes through.“When you are in that phase it’s challenging to get out but a great player will find his way out. That’s why going out and playing some practice games, India A games and getting some runs under my belt did well for my confidence and I could go back and focus on getting runs more than why I was getting out and trying to dissect my technique or batting.”(READ: Miguel Cummins bats 95 minutes for second-longest Test duck ever)But what of getting out to Chase twice in both Test, the second when walking right across his stumps? A lapse of concentration?“Sometimes when you play a sweep or a paddle sweep there is a certain percentage of premeditation in it,” reasoned Rahul as he said it was an attempt to dominate Chase. “You have played the offspinner for a bit, five or six overs, and I knew the lines that he was bowling, he was outside off. I was thinking boundary and not thinking about getting lbw or anything. I was thinking about runs. Since I had hit him for a boundary before that ball I knew he would try to bowl a better length which is easier for me to paddle. But unfortunately I didn’t execute the shot really well.“If I had put bat on the ball it would have probably gone for a four and then that would have put a lot more pressure on the bowler. Two boundaries in two balls, he would have probably pulled back his length and that could have got some more boundaries. But unfortunately that’s a battle that he won. Probably won’t happen again or probably will happen again. That’s how batting is – you try to minimise your mistakes.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/india-vs-west-indies-kl-rahul-bitterly-disappointed-at-throwing-away-another-start-884009?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

4157,Trump regrets not raising tariffs on Chinese goods higher: US,"US President Donald Trump on Sunday acknowledged having second thoughts on ""escalating"" the trade war with China after hiking tariffs on Chinese goods. The White House later clarified that Trump meant that he regretted not raising the tariffs even higher. The US had on Friday announced it will raise tariffs on Chinese goods worth around $550 billion by 5%.",Reuters,"BIARRITZ, France (Reuters) - President Donald Trump wishes he had raised tariffs on Chinese goods even higher last week, the White House said on Sunday, even as Trump signaled he did not plan to follow through with a demand that U.S. firms find ways to close operations in China. Trump raised eyebrows on the sidelines of a G7 summit when he responded in the affirmative to questions from reporters on whether he had any second thoughts about raising tariffs on Chinese goods by 5%. “President Trump responded in the affirmative - because he regrets not raising the tariffs higher,” White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement afterward that sought to clarify the president’s remarks. Trump announced the additional duty on some $550 billion in targeted Chinese goods on Friday, hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods. The move was the latest round in a tit-for-tat trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has damaged global growth, upset allies, and raised market fears that the world economy will tip into a recession. It came just hours after Trump said he was ordering U.S. companies to find “alternatives” to China, including closing operations there and moving production to the United States. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump could order companies out of China under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act if he declared a national emergency. Trump indicated on Sunday that he was not planning such a step at this time, however. “I could declare a national emergency. I think when they steal and take out, and — intellectual property theft, anywhere from $300 billion to $500 billion a year, and where we have a total loss of almost a trillion dollars a year ... in many ways, that’s an emergency,” he said. “I have no plan right now. Actually, we’re getting along very well with China right now. We’re talking,” Trump said. Mnuchin said the president did want U.S. businesses to start looking to shift investments away from China, saying they would be better off in the event the U.S.-China trade war lasted for a long time. “We want them to be in places where they’re trading partners that respect us and trade with us fairly,” he said on the “Fox News Sunday” program. During his meeting with Johnson on Sunday in France, Trump was asked if he had second thoughts about his latest escalation. “Yeah, sure. Why not?” he said. The reporter repeated the question and Trump replied: “Might as well. Might as well.” A second reporter followed up again, asking if he had second thoughts about escalating the trade war with China. “I have second thoughts about everything,” Trump responded. Asked to clarify Trump’s remarks, Mnuchin, who is one of the lead U.S. negotiators in trade talks with Beijing, said Trump remained resolute in trying to force concessions from China. Another top official said he did not think Beijing would retaliate for the latest increase in tariffs. “I think his was an action to respond to their action. So I doubt whether they’re going to take another step,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” program. “We’ll have to wait and see.” Mnuchin said Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were now “enemies” on trade, despite an otherwise good relationship. “President Xi is still his friend,” he said. “But as it relates to financial issues and trade, we have become enemies. We’re not making progress.” Reporting by Jeff Mason in Biarritz; Additional reporting by David Morgan and Ginger Gibson in Washington; Editing by Toby Chopra, Tim Ahmann and Sonya Hepinstall",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-tariffs/trump-regrets-not-raising-tariffs-on-china-higher-white-house-says-idINKCN1VF0F0?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He added that the team will also visit Jammu and Ladakh at a later date. ""The team will explore development possibilities, where schools, colleges can be opened,"" Naqvi said.",The Financial Express,"A Minority Affairs Ministry team will visit the Kashmir Valley for two days from Tuesday to identify the areas to implement centrally-sponsored development projects after provisions of Article 370 was abrogated, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said. He also asserted that those opposing the government’s withdrawal of J&K’s special status, acting as per their “political prejudice”, will also come around to support the move after seeing its impact. “A team of senior officials, including the Secretary, will be visiting the area (Kashmir Valley) on August 27-28. The team will explore development possibilities — where schools, colleges, skill development centres can be opened,” Naqvi told PTI in an interview.The team will look at all possibilities of social-economic development projects, he said. The minister also said “precautions” taken in J&K are targeted at a “handful of separatists” who can mislead the people. “It is the job of a responsible government to not allow any misinformation campaign to be run,” he said. Naqvi said the team will also visit Jammu and Ladakh at a later date. The Minority Affairs Minister ruled out reconsideration on abrogation of Article 370 provisions, saying there was no going back. “It is (Narendra) Modi’s government. Everybody knows that in this government, decision is made after a lot of thinking, but there is no question of a rethink after a decision has been made,” he said. Asked if people of the Kashmir Valley were supportive of the government move, Naqvi claimed that they were “absolutely supportive”.Earlier this month, the government had revoked J&K’s special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and divided the state into two Union territories — Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. The focus of the ministry is now on Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, Naqvi said, and emphasised that the revocation of Article 370 has opened up possibilities of large scale development there.Naqvi also said the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) will also be applicable in all areas of J&K and Ladakh. The PMJVK is a centrally-sponsored scheme that seeks to improve the development of minority concentration areas through creation of socioeconomic infrastructure, provision of basic amenities, and other measures. “Now the ministry will be active in the entire region — Leh, Ladakh, Kargil, Jammu and Kashmir. We will make efforts to set up schools colleges, polytechnic, engineering colleges and hospitals,” Naqvi said.“Because of Article 370, there were many things which we wanted to do, but could not do it. Now it can be done,” he said. Asked about the reaction to the government move, Naqvi said “some opposition friends” had hopes that the country will be “set ablaze” with the Article 370 move, but the opposite happened, and the move was welcomed. “It was welcomed in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. Article 370 has not given anything to the people there, but has taken away from J-K and Ladakh. Over 100 laws on education, employment, human rights, minority or child rights, were not applicable there. So, the people realised that Article 370 was a big impediment in their path to development,” he said.On the Congress leaders expressing divergent views — with some expressing support for the government’s move while others opposing it — Naqvi said those who know Kashmir, its ground reality and don’t think with a politically prejudiced mind, are favouring the move. “Those who have political baggage and political prejudice are opposing it. But in future they will also support it on seeing the impact,” he said.

China's Commerce Ministry said the US' actions seriously damage the multilateral trade system and the normal international trade order.",Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Saturday it strongly opposes Washington’s decision to levy additional tariffs on $550 billion worth of Chinese goods and warned the United States of consequences if it does not end its “wrong actions”.   The comments made by China’s Ministry of Commerce came after the U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Washington will impose an additional 5% duty the Chinese goods, hours after Beijing announced its latest retaliatory tariffs on about $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, in the latest tit-for-tat moves in their bilateral trade dispute. “Such unilateral and bullying trade protectionism and maximum pressure violates the consensus reached by head of China and United States, violates the principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit, and seriously damages the multilateral trade system and the normal international trade order,” China’s commerce ministry said in a statement on Saturday. “China strongly urges the United States not to misjudge the situation or underestimate determination of the Chinese people,” it added. Trump’s latest tariff move, announced on Twitter, said the United States would raise its existing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to 30% from the current 25% beginning on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the communist People’s Republic of China. At the same time, Trump announced an increase in planned tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese goods to 15% from 10%. The United States will begin imposing those tariffs on some products starting Sept. 1, but tariffs on about half of those goods have been delayed until Dec. 15. Trump was responding to Beijing’s decision on Friday night that it was planning to impose retaliatory tariff on $75 billion worth of U.S. imports ranging from soybean to ethanol. China will also reinstitute tariffs of 25% on cars and 5% on auto parts suspended last December. The White House economic adviser said earlier in the week  the Trump administration was planning in-person talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in September. It is unclear if the bilateral meeting would still take place. The year-long trade war between the world’s two largest economies has roiled financial markets and shaken the global economy.

The Quds Force is the overseas arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. ""Iran has no immunity anywhere. Our forces operate in every sector against Iranian aggression,"" Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu said.",Reuters,"JERUSALEM/DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Israeli aircraft on Saturday struck Iranian forces near Damascus that had been planning to launch “killer drones” at targets in Israel, an Israeli military spokesman said.  “The strike targeted Iranian Quds Force operatives and Shiite militias which were preparing to advance attack plans targeting sites in Israel from within Syria over the last number of days,” the military said in a statement. The elite Quds Force is the overseas arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus told reporters the forces on Thursday had been preparing to launch “killer drones” armed with explosives at northern Israel.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military had thwarted the planned Iranian attack. “Iran has no immunity anywhere. Our forces operate in every sector against the Iranian aggression,” he said on Twitter. Syrian state media said Syrian air defences intercepted “hostile targets” over Damascus, the capital, Saturday night. Witnesses in Damascus said they heard and saw explosions in the sky. “The aggression is ongoing and air defences are confronting hostile targets and are downing most of them in the southern region,” state media outlet SANA said, indicating areas south of Damascus.   The Syrian army said in a statement that “the majority of the Israeli missiles were destroyed before reaching their targets.” Conricus, however, said the impact of the Israeli strikes was “significant.” Israel says it has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria against Iranian targets trying to establish a permanent military presence there and against advanced weapon shipments to Tehran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Iran and Hezbollah are helping President Bashar al-Assad in the eight-year Syria war. Russia, which is also aiding Assad, has largely turned a blind eye to the Israeli air strikes. Netanyahu spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, the Israeli leader’s office said. On Thursday, Netanyahu hinted of possible Israeli involvement in a series of blasts in the past few weeks that have hit weapon depots and bases belonging to paramilitary groups in Iraq, many of them backed by Iran. On Wednesday, the PMF, the umbrella grouping of Iraq’s mostly Shi’ite Muslim paramilitary groups, said the United States had allowed four Israeli drones to enter the region accompanying U.S. forces and carry out missions on Iraqi territory. The U.S.-led coalition, in Iraq to fight remnants of the Islamic State group, dismissed the statement and the Pentagon denied it.

Pooja had asked the driver to take her to the airport at 4 am on July 31 after earlier having booked him on July 30. The driver attacked her with rod, knife and a stone before dumping her body near the airport.",The News Minute,"A Kolkata woman was brutally murdered allegedly by a cab driver who tried to rob her on the way to Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru on July 31, according to reports. The cab driver, HM Nagesh, a resident of Hegganahalli Cross, was caught on August 21 after investigations by the local police. According to the New Indian Express, he had missed out on paying two EMIs on his vehicle load and needed money. Pooja Singh De, 32, was a model-cum-event manager who had visited the city on July 30 for an event. She was returning to Kolkata when the brutal crime took place. The victim had been found with head injuries and multiple stab wounds, according to Deccan Herald. . Pooja’s body was discovered by villagers near the compound of the airport near Kadayarappanahalli village at about 6.30 am on July 31. They informed the police. She was found wearing a Titan watch, ‘Jealous 21’ jeans and a pair of sandals. Police could not find her handbag, so there was no proof of identification, other than the accessories and clothes she wore. The police then sent teams to Kolkata and New Delhi to scour through missing person reports and established the identity of the victim, as per The Hindu.Pooja booked the driver via the Ola app on the evening of July 30 from Crescent Road in Kumara Park to a hotel in Parappana Agrahara. She later called the driver separately and asked him to take her to the airport reportedly at about 4 am the next day. He agreed, and she boarded the cab at Hosur Road at 4.15 am. Police say that Nagesh deviated from the main road and demanded money from Pooja. When she refused, he attacked her with a jack rod. He then looked through her bags and pockets but was only able to find Rs 500 and two mobile phones.He then allegedly attempted to dump her behind KIA near Kaada Yarappanahalli village, but she regained consciousness and tried to escape. However, Nagesh allegedly attacked her again with a knife and a stone, this time fatally. Police told media that Pooja had been in the city for event management work. Once Pooja’s identity was determined, with the help of special teams from Delhi and Kolkata, they learnt that she had booked an Ola cab. After this, police were led to Nagesh. Police said Nagesh confessed to the crime and police were able to recover the victim’s belongings from him. He has been produced before a magistrate and remanded to judicial custody.Police have also urged passengers to not individually book rides with cab drivers they meet on trips through cab aggregators. ""In this case, the cab driver seems to have felt emboldened as the said trip was not on record with the aggregator,"" said DCP (North East) Bheemashankar S Guled, according to The Hindu.   Read: How Ola and Uber can be more proactive about passenger safety ",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/murder-kolkata-model-bengaluru-ola-driver-arrested-crime-107753?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Biden's comment came as he recalled the impact that the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr and Robert F Kennedy had on his life.,Daily Mail,"Former Vice President Joe Biden posed a shocking hypothetical question to voters at a New Hampshire Rally Friday, asking the crowd to imagine what America would be like 'if Barrack Obama had been assassinated?’The stark declaration came as part of a meandering soliloquy at the closing of a town hall meeting on the campus of Dartmouth College.The Democratic front-runner made reference to the formative moments of his college years, most namely the 1968 assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., which just two days ago the self-proclaimed ‘gaffe machine’ recalled to have happened in the late 70s.‘My senior semester, they were both shot and killed,’ Biden recalled Friday. ‘Imagine what would have happened if, God forbid, if Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would've happened in America?’Scroll down for video Former Vice President Joe Biden posed a shocking hypothetical question to voters at a New Hampshire Rally Friday when he asked the crowd to imagine ‘What if Barrack Obama had been assassinated?’The stark comment came as part of a meandering discussion at the closing of a town hall meeting on the campus of Dartmouth College, which also featured mentions of school shootingsThe timing of the rhetorical question seemed all the more bizarre, considering it came just hours after the Biden campaign sought to exploit the 76-year-old’s links to Obama, commemorating the 11th anniversary of him being selected as his Vice President on Twitter.It also came amid mounting scrutiny regarding the presidential hopeful’s numerous blunders and slip-ups during televised interviews and campaign speeches, which have been frequent since he launched his White House bid in April.The point Biden seemed to be attempting to make was that the tumultuous events of the late 1960s and early 70s had heightened his political consciousness and kick-started his political career, though the message seemed somewhat lost on the crowd.A campaign spokesperson told the New York Times that Biden has previously attempted to draw an analogy between an Obama assassination and the political killings of 1968 when addressing audiences who weren’t alive at the time.The timing of the rhetorical question seemed all the more bizarre, considering it came just hours after the Biden campaign sought to exploit the 76-year-old’s links to Obama, commemorating the 11th anniversary of him being selected as Vice President on TwitterThe Democratic front-runner also made mention of formative moments during his college years, most namely the 1968 assassinations of Robert F.

In a comparison between his own political awakening and the present day, Biden asked how many members of the audience were in high school or college.In response to the 40-or-so raised palms scattered across the hall, Biden said: ‘Unless I’m mistaken, Donald Trump did for your generation what the loss of two of my heroes did for mine,’ he told the students. ‘What they did was make you realize, my God, we’re in trouble.’Biden issued the parting shot and promptly left the stage to a thunderous roar.At the later event, he resurrected his assault of the 45th US President, accusing Trump of becoming ‘more and more unhinged’ as his weeks in the Oval Office pass.‘He's now feeling the pressure of an economy teetering on a recession and he’s not handling it very well,’ Biden said. ‘His trade war with China is blowing up in his face. I think it's only going to make him more erratic,’ he said.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7389523/Joe-Biden-shocks-New-Hampshire-crowd-asked-imagine-Obama-assassinated.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4228,Abraham's brace secures Lampard 1st win as Chelsea manager,"Frank Lampard secured his first win as Chelsea manager after they defeated Norwich City 3-2 in the Premier League at Carrow Road on Saturday. Forward Tammy Abraham, who scored twice, became the third youngest player to score a brace in the Premier League for Chelsea. Further, the victory means Chelsea are unbeaten against Norwich in the sides' 16 meetings.",Reuters,"NORWICH, England (Reuters) - Frank Lampard celebrated his first victory as Chelsea manager with Tammy Abraham’s double inspiring a 3-2 win by his youthful side over Norwich City in a pulsating Premier League encounter at Carrow Road on Saturday. The 21-year-old Abraham struck on the half-volley in the third minute and, after a see-saw contest in which newly-promoted Norwich twice fought back from a goal down, he proved the match-winner with another superb strike in the 68th minute. Teemu Pukki continued his dazzling start to the season by netting a league-leading fifth goal for the Canaries but it was to prove in vain as the victory provided much-needed relief for Lampard, one of Chelsea’s greatest players. Lampard finally got off the mark at the fourth attempt after a loss at Manchester United, defeat to Liverpool in the UEFA Super Cup and a draw with Leicester City. Chelsea, fielding a starting line-up with an average age of 24 — the club’s youngest in the Premier League since February 1994 — took the lead early when an overlapping Cesar Azpilicueta drifted a perfect cross from the right to the feet of the unmarked Abraham, who slotted the ball past goalkeeper Tim Krul. Norwich struck back quickly, with Emiliano Buendia finding Pukki, who squared from near the left post for 21-year-old midfielder Todd Cantwell to score from close range. Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount made it 2-1 with a fine 17th-minute goal but 13 minutes later Buendia’s fine through ball  put in the prolific Finn Pukki, who beat Kepa Arrizabalaga from a tight angle despite the Chelsea keeper getting a hand to the ball. Chelsea looked more assured after the break and their pressure told. Mateo Kovacic found Abraham, who rounded two Norwich defenders before firing home the winner from outside the box. Abraham became the youngest player to score twice in a Premier League fixture for Chelsea since 1998. “It is something I have always dreamed about doing, to score for my childhood club, to get into the first team and to start scoring goals,” he said. “I am just happy I can help my team.” The win was a welcome relief for Lampard, who said: “Our performances haven’t given us what we deserved so far — but today it did. “It was a tough test and Norwich will get a lot of points here because they are a good side. The two goals we gave away I didn’t like but there were lots of good elements to our play and I’m really pleased. “I’m particularly pleased for Tammy and he scored two good goals and the winning goal but I want to talk about all the players today as we controlled the game on a hot day.” Reporting by George Sargent; Editing by Ian Chadband and Clare Fallon",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-nor-che-report/lampard-earns-first-win-as-chelsea-boss-at-norwich-idUKKCN1VE0JB?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

As a cricketer it is a dream day. And it is something we can’t plan for, it just has to happen. It is something which we always work for. Some days it does come off and I was fortunate enough that it happened yesterday. It was just one of those when you’re in the zone and everything comes off,” Gowtham told PTI during an interaction.By his own admission, he never knew about the record.“I never knew about the record. I just enjoyed myself in the middle. I got a chance to bat higher up in the order and I planned to bat aggressively and things just fell in place,” he added.Gowtham further said he was in a good frame of mind and that things were falling into place.“Maybe you can say I am in a good frame of mind more than anything. I am in a good space and a good frame of mind and things are falling into place,” he said about his ton and eight-wicket haul.He also said he was delighted to be holding the purple cap, adding “it was something special. I have always been aiming to hold the purple cap. I am fortunate enough it has happened this season.”Before coming into this edition of the KPL, Gowtham was in fine fettle for India A against West Indies A in the Caribbean, picking 11 wickets in two games, including two five-fors.He said the tour went off well and the ball was coming out well, adding that getting two five-fors helped the team win, which was more important than individual performance.“It (the tour) went really well, the confidence is always there. It did come out well. I got a couple of five-fors, it helped the team win the trophy, that is more important to me than my individual performance,” the Karnataka all-rounder added.Asked how playing in the IPL had helped, Gowtham said when one rubs shoulders with the best players in the world, it helps one learn things and also develop one’s own game.“Playing in the IPL, definitely the confidence level always goes up and it is always high. It does give you confidence that you can change the game around. You get to play with the best in the world. Yeah, definitely when you rub shoulders with them, you will obviously learn something from them and develop your game. It helps to a great extent,” he added.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/didnt-expect-to-play-this-kind-of-an-innings-krishnappa-gowtham-883766?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

A day before the start of the ongoing first Test against Windies in Antigua, Bumrah was all over internet for all the wrong reasons. Before the start of the match, the Indian stars were chilling at the Jolly beach.Following the party, they took to their respective social media accounts in order to post photos. Bumrah also did the same and although the picture grabbed a lot of eyeballs, the reason for the same was not at all good. Posing alongside his skipper Virat Kohli, Bumrah and Kohli were seen flaunting their fit bodies. But Bumrah seemed to have flaunted little more than necessary.AdvertisementThe India pacer was wearing black translucent underwear and it was quickly spotted by the fans. The fans thought that Bumrah’s private parts were visible and were quick to troll the bowler. Consequently, Bumrah was roasted to the hilt on social media following his “indecent exposure.” While some had a good laugh at Bumrah’s expense, some went on to slam him.It did not take Jasprit Bumrah long to hit back at the trolls. The India star posted a cryptic message on his Instagram story while he took a subtle dig at his critics.

The left-handed Japanese stepped up after the break, reeling off four points to surge to 15-10. Praneeth couldn't find the winners regularly and committed too many unforced errors to allow Momota widen the gap between them.

Praneeth was more competitive initially in the second game as he was tied 2-2 with his opponent but the Indian failed to lift the hard-hitting returns of Momota, sending the shuttle wide or at the net.  While Praneeth was erroneous, Momota was consistent and it reflected in the scoreline, as the Japanese quickly jumped to 9-2.  A precise smash from Praneeth helped him to take a point but he misjudged a shuttle at the backline and then hit the nets as Momota grabbed a 11-3 advantage in the mid-game interval.

US has threatened a ban on the company's equipment alleging security concerns, which has affected its $100 billion business since mid-May. CEO Ren Zhengfei said in June that the blacklisting would hit revenue by $30 billion.",Reuters,"HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese technology giant Huawei said on Friday the impact of U.S. trade restrictions on its business will be less than what it initially feared, though the curbs could push its smartphone unit’s revenue lower by about $10 billion this year. Huawei Technologies’ $100 billion business has been hit hard since mid-May after Washington put the world’s second-largest smartphone maker in a so-called Entity List that threatens to cut off its access to essential U.S. components and technology. In its first assessment of the impact of the restrictions, Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said in June the blacklisting would hit the company’s revenue by $30 billion, leaving it without any topline growth for 2019. “It seems it is going to be a little less than that. But you have to wait till our results in March,” Eric Xu, Huawei’s deputy chairman, said at a news conference to introduce new artificial intelligence chips at its headquarters in Shenzhen. Huawei’s consumer business group - which includes the smartphones business and is racing to develop an operating system of its own in preparation for the worst case scenario of being stripped of essential Google Android apps - is doing “much better” this year than initially feared, Xu said.  “But a [sales] reduction of more than $10 billion could happen,” he said. Huawei’s consumer business group reported revenue of 349 billion yuan in 2018.  Spurred by promotions and patriotic purchases, Huawei’s smartphone sales in China surged by a nearly a third compared to a year ago to a record high in the June quarter, helping it more than offset a shipments slump in the global market. Huawei said last month the consumer business group turned in revenue of 221 billion yuan in the first half of 2019. In a temporary relief to Huawei, Washington said this week that it will extend by 90 days a reprieve that permits Huawei to buy from U.S. firms in order to supply existing customers, while adding more than 40 of Huawei’s units to its economic blacklist. Xu said the reprieve was “meaningless” to Huawei, whose employees are “fully prepared” to live and work with the ban.     Huawei, which has been developing its own chips to reduce its reliance on foreign technologies, reiterated on Friday that its chips, including a new AI chipset it launched on Friday called the Ascend 910, are for its own use and it does not aim to become a chip vendor. “We are open to discussing partnerships with AI chipset development companies so there are chipsets of various kinds that could be used in Huawei products. So, positioning our chipset business as a standalone is a scenario that is not going to happen,” Xu said. The Ascend 910 AI processor, a 7-nanometre chipset designed by Huawei’s semiconductor unit HiSilicon based on ARM architecture for AI model training, has more computing power than any other AI chipset in the world, Xu said.  British chip designer ARM earlier this year announced it was halting deals with Huawei in compliance with the ban, dealing a blow to Huawei, but Xu said Huawei’s perpetual ownership of the ARMv8 license meant the Ascend 910 chipset would not be affected.  Huawei said it was no longer able to work with U.S. chip designers such as Cadence Design Systems Inc and Synopsys due to the trade restrictions, but the company has alternatives.

His detention came amid tensions between the UK and China over the anti-government protests in Hong Kong.",ANI,"Hong Kong, Aug 24 (ANI): A United Kingdom consular worker who was detained in mainland China for 15 days, has returned to Hong Kong, said his family.Simon Cheng, a 28-year-old trade and investment officer at the consulate, was reportedly detained by the government while he was returning from a trip to mainland China, CNN reported.Cheng disappeared on August 8 when he went to attend an event in the border city of Shenzhen. He was supposed to come back on the same day, according to his girlfriend. However, he fell out of contact while attempting to pass through Chinese immigration and since has been detained in mainland China for unknown reasons.Following reports in the local media about Cheng's disappearance, the UK raised the issue and expressed concern about the same. ""We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen,"" a British Foreign Office spokesperson said Tuesday.

The demonstrations were triggered by the now-suspended extradition bill which would allow suspects to be extradited to China to face trial.Even though the bill has been suspended, the protests have continued and taken on a more pro-democracy outlook. Protesters have also demanded an inquiry into police authority and alleged brutality.Several street clashes have taken place between protesters and the police ever since the beginning of the anti-government protests. At least 748 protesters have been arrested ever since the protests broke out in Hong Kong, police said on Friday.China has decried the protests, with one Chinese official alleging that the demonstrations have ""begun to show signs of terrorism"".

4283,Salman Butt accuses PCB of discriminatory behaviour,"Ex-Pakistan captain Salman Butt, who was banned for taking part in spot-fixing, has accused the Pakistan Cricket Board of discriminating against him by not considering him for selection. Butt brought to attention the selection of pacer Mohammad Amir, questioning, ""Why can one player play and the other can't? What was special in one and what did the other not have?""",CricTracker,"Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif were the three players banned for their role in the spot-fixing scandal in the 2010 Test in England. While Amir has returned after serving the suspension and played more than a handful of matches over the past few years, the other two are still waiting for their opportunity. Asif seems to have resigned in terms of making a comeback. But Butt is still hopeful and has been performing consistently in the domestic arena.But the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) selectors have constantly overlooked him. Butt has now sought an explanation from the previous chairman of the board, Shahryar Khan and Najam Sethi. He also pointed out how Amir was quickly brought back into the setup and he has been made to wait despite plundering runs.Advertisement“This can only be explained by the previous chairman of the PCB, Shahryar Khan or Najam Sethi. Why can one player play and the other can’t? What was special in one and what did the other not have? He hasn’t even played a complete season. I have participated in all seasons completely,” Butt said while speaking to cricketpakistan.com.pk.Salman Butt also questioned the selectors’ decision to go into the 2019 World Cup with only two openers Imam-ul-Haq and Fakhar Zaman. The duo wasn’t consistent enough in its trade during the tournament. Former Pakistan captain also felt that the underperforming openers at the international level are constantly being given chance.“You have been covering cricket for a long time; you should tell me if I deserve a place with these players. I don’t think this is an issue. You don’t go into a World Cup with just two openers. They keep losing test matches and still make no changes. They are lucky to be playing 75 percent of their matches in the UAE,” the 34-year-old added.Salman Butt is now hoping for the players to be selected on merit and not on preferences.

Luckily, I have been able to repay the faith by performing well."" Jadeja hit 58 runs off 112 deliveries with the help of six fours and one six.",CricTracker,"Ravindra Jadeja’s selection ahead of Ravi Ashwin for India’s opening Test versus the Windies raised a number of questions. Sunil Gavaskar, the former Indian batsman, was taken aback and he termed Ashwin’s omission from the game an ‘astonishing’ one. Gavaskar said that the Tamil Nadu tweaker has a superlative record against the Caribbean team and leaving him out didn’t make much sense.However, Jadeja showed his class at the North Sound in Antigua. The southpaw picked up the solitary wicket of Shamarh Brooks in the first innings. With the bat in hand, the left-handed batsman notched 58 runs off 112 deliveries with the help of six fours and one sixAdvertisementHe was the last Indian wicket to fall at the score of 297. Jason Holder accounted for his dismissal in the 97th over. After playing the good hand, Jadeja thanked his skipper Virat Kohli for showing faith in him. Jadeja was satisfied with the fact that he was able to repay the captain’s faith.“Obviously you feel good when the skipper believes in you, thinks of you as the main player. Luckily, I have been able to repay the faith by performing well,” Jadeja was quoted as saying in the press conference after the day’s play at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.Ravindra Jadeja came to bat after the fall of Ajinkya Rahane’s wicket with the score at 189. Following a few overs, he lost Rishabh Pant as his partner. However, he was determined to make an impact. Jadeja built a useful stand of 60 runs along with Ishant Sharma, who showed grit in the middle, having scored 19 runs off 62 balls. Jadeja communicated with Ishant and told about building a stand.“When I was batting out there in the middle, I just looked to build a partnership. I was focussing to play with the tail-enders. I was just worried about my game, I was trying to give my best out on the park. I was constantly talking to Ishant, and we talked about staying out in the middle for as long as possible. We were thinking about one over at a time. I am just very positive in my mind, my shot selection is positive.“When Rishabh got out, I was talking to Ishant about staying out in the middle and building a partnership. It is not good for opponents if the lower order is constantly scoring runs, so it was the game-plan from our side,” Jadeja added.",https://www.crictracker.com/windies-vs-india-ravindra-jadeja-thanks-virat-kohli-for-showing-faith-in-him/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4288,Facebook knew about Cambridge Analytica months before it was reported,"A document released on Friday showed that Facebook was aware that Cambridge Analytica was gathering user data months before it was first reported. An email chain from September 2015 showed its staff investigating the company for potentially abusing user data. Facebook said Friday that the document could potentially ""confuse two different events surrounding our knowledge of Cambridge Analytica"".",TechCrunch,"Oh hey, y’all, it’s Friday! It’s August! Which means it’s a great day for Facebook  to drop a little news it would prefer you don’t notice. News that you won’t find a link to on the homepage of Facebook’s Newsroom — which is replete with colorfully illustrated items it does want you to read (like the puffed up claim that “Now You Can See and Control the Data That Apps and Websites Share With Facebook”).The blog post Facebook would really prefer you didn’t notice is tucked away in a News sub-section of this website — where it’s been confusingly entitled: Document Holds the Potential for Confusion. And has an unenticing grey image of a document icon to further put you off — just in case you happened to stumble on it after all. It’s almost as if Facebook is saying “definitely don’t click here“…So what is Facebook trying to bury in the horse latitudes of summer?An internal email chain, starting September 2015, which shows a glimpse of what Facebook’s own staff knew about the activity of Cambridge Analytica prior to The Guardian’s December 2015 scoop — when the newspaper broke the story that the controversial (and now defunct) data analytics firm, then working for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, had harvested data on millions of Facebook users without their knowledge and/or consent, and was using psychological insights gleaned from the data to target voters.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s official timeline of events about what he knew when vis-à-vis the Cambridge Analytica story has always been that his knowledge of the matter dates to December 2015 — when The Guardian published its story.But the email thread Facebook is now releasing shows internal concerns being raised almost two months earlier.This chimes with previous (more partial) releases of internal correspondence pertaining to Cambridge Analytica  — which have also come out as a result of legal actions (and which we’ve reported on previously here and here).If you click to download the latest release, which Facebook suggests it “agreed” with the District of Columbia Attorney General to “jointly make public,” you’ll find a redacted thread of emails in which Facebook staffers raise a number of platform policy violation concerns related to the “political partner space,” writing September 29, 2015, that “many companies seem to be on the edge- possibly over.”Cambridge Analytica is first identified by name — when it’s described by a Facebook employee as “a sketchy (to say the least) data modelling company that has penetrated our market deeply” — on September 22, 2015, per this email thread. It is one of many companies the staffer writes are suspected of scraping user data — but is also described as “the largest and most aggressive on the conservative side.”On September 30, 2015, a Facebook staffer responds to this, asking for App IDs and app names for the apps engaging in scraping user data — before writing: “My hunch is that these apps’ data-scraping is likely non-compliant.”“It would be very difficult to engage in data-scraping activity as you described while still being compliant with FPPs [Facebook Platform Policies],” this person adds.Cambridge Analytica gets another direct mention (“the Cambridge app”) on the same day. A different Facebook staffer then chips in with a view that “it’s very likely these companies are not in violation of any of our terms” — before asking for “concrete examples” and warning against calling them to ask questions unless “red flags” have been confirmed.On October 13, a Facebook employee chips back into the thread with the view that “there are likely a few data policy violations here.”The email thread goes on to discuss concerns related to additional political partners and agencies using Facebook’s platform at that point, including ForAmerica, Creative Response Concepts, NationBuilder and Strategic Media 21. Which perhaps explains Facebook’s lack of focus on CA — if potentially “sketchy” political activity was apparently widespread.On December 11 another Facebook staffer writes to ask for an expedited review of Cambridge Analytica — saying it’s “unfortunately… now a PR issue,” i.e. as a result of The Guardian publishing its article.The same day a Facebook employee emails to say Cambridge Analytica “is hi pri at this point,” adding: “We need to sort this out ASAP” — a month and a half after the initial concern was raised.Also on December 11 a staffer writes that they had not heard of GSR, the Cambridge-based developer CA hired to extract Facebook user data, before The Guardian article named it. But other Facebook staffers chip in to reveal personal knowledge of the psychographic profiling techniques deployed by Cambridge Analytica and GSR’s Dr Aleksandr Kogan, with one writing that Kogan was their post-doc supervisor at Cambridge University.Another says they are friends with Michal Kosinski, the lead author of a personality modeling paper that underpins the technique used by CA to try to manipulate voters — which they described as “solid science.”A different staffer also flags the possibility that Facebook has worked with Kogan — ironically enough “on research on the Protect & Care team” — citing the “Wait, What” thread and another email, neither of which appear to have been released by Facebook in this “Exhibit 1” bundle.So we can only speculate on whether Facebook’s decision — around September 2015 — to hire Kogan’s GSR co-founder, Joseph Chancellor, appears as a discussion item in the “Wait, What” thread…Putting its own spin on the release of these internal emails in a blog post, Facebook sticks to its prior line that “unconfirmed reports of scraping” and “policy violations by Aleksandr Kogan” are two separate issues, writing:We believe this document has the potential to confuse two different events surrounding our knowledge of Cambridge Analytica. There is no substantively new information in this document and the issues have been previously reported. As we have said many times, including last week to a British parliamentary committee, these are two distinct issues. One involved unconfirmed reports of scraping — accessing or collecting public data from our products using automated means — and the other involved policy violations by Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who sold user data to Cambridge Analytica. This document proves the issues are separate; conflating them has the potential to mislead people.It has previously also referred to the internal concerns raised about CA as “rumors.”“Facebook was not aware that Kogan sold data to Cambridge Analytica until December 2015. That is a fact that we have testified to under oath, that we have described to our core regulators, and that we stand by today,” it adds now.It also claims that after an engineer responded to concerns that CA was scraping data and looked into it they were not able to find any such evidence. “Even if such a report had been confirmed, such incidents would not naturally indicate the scale of the misconduct that Kogan had engaged in,” Facebook adds.The company has sought to dismiss the privacy litigation brought against it by the District of Columbia which is related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal — but has been unsuccessful in derailing the case thus far.The DC complaint alleges that Facebook allowed third-party developers to access consumers’ personal data, including information on their online behavior, in order to offer apps on its platform, and that it failed to effectively oversee and enforce its platform policies by not taking reasonable steps to protect consumer data and privacy. It also alleges Facebook failed to inform users of the CA breach.Facebook has also failed to block another similar lawsuit that’s been filed in Washington, DC by Attorney General Karl Racine — which has alleged lax oversight and misleading privacy standards.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4289,Top US book publishers sue Amazon's Audible for copyright infringement,"Top US publishers sued Amazon's Audible on Friday for copyright infringement, over a new speech-to-text feature which it announced in July. The feature, 'Audible Captions', uses AI to show the text on-screen as a book is narrated. Amazon reportedly may argue that an AI-generated transcription constitutes as original work. Publishers including Penguin, Simon & Schuster seek to block the launch.",Engadget,"Several of the biggest book publishers in the US have launched a new lawsuit against Audible over a feature they say infringes on their copyright. Leading the suit are the so-called ""Big Five"" of US publishing: Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster.At the center of the case is the Captions feature the Amazon-owned company announced last month. The feature uses machine learning to allow Audible users to transcribe an audiobook into text. Since it announced Captions, Audible has positioned the feature as a student aid. However, the company also plans to make it available to subscribers. From the perspective of publishers, audiobooks have separate licenses from ebooks, which they claim Audible has not secured.""Audible Captions takes publishers' proprietary audiobooks, converts the narration into unauthorized text, and distributes the entire text of these 'new' digital books to Audible's customers,"" the lawsuit reads. ""Audible's actions — taking copyrighted works and repurposing them for its own benefit without permission — are the kind of quintessential infringement that the Copyright Act directly forbids.""In response, Audible is likely to argue that an AI-generated transcription constitutes an original work, even if what it creates is nearly identical to the original text. If the lawsuit escalates to the point where a judge must rule on it, it could become a precedent-setting decision on AI-created works.As The Verge notes, this isn't the first time Amazon has incited the ire of publishers over a planned transcription feature. A decade ago, alongside the Kindle 2 the company introduced a text-to-speech feature that allowed the e-reader to transcribe an ebook into audio. The issue then, as it is now, was that Amazon didn't agree to pay for both ebook and audiobook rights. The company eventually relented and allowed major publishers like Random House to disable the feature. This time around, the stakes appear much higher, and Amazon has more clout than it has had at any point in the past.Update: 8/24 3:07PM ET: Audible has issued a statement in response to the lawsuit, saying it never intended for Captions to replace the written text of a book. The company also reiterated the educational value of the feature. You can read the full text below. ""We are surprised and disappointed by this action and any implication that we have not been speaking and working with publishers about this feature, which has not yet launched. Captions was developed because we, like so many leading educators and parents, want to help kids who are not reading engage more through listening. This feature would allow such listeners to follow along with a few lines of machine-generated text as they listen to the audio performance. It is not and was never intended to be a book. We disagree with the claims that this violates any rights and look forward to working with publishers and members of the professional creative community to help them better understand the educational and accessibility benefits of this innovation.""",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/23/book-publishers-sue-audible-ai-transcription/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The two leaders agreed in June to restart working-level negotiations but the United States has so far been unsuccessful in its attempts to get the talks going again. The process has been stalled since an unsuccessful second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. Trump said earlier this month Kim told him he was ready to resume talks on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes and would stop missile testing as soon as U.S.-South Korea military exercises ended.  However, while the joint military drills are over, North Korea’s continued launches caused “strong concern”, South Korea’s National Security Council (NSC) said on Saturday.  Trump said after the latest launches the United States has a good relationship with North Korea. “Kim Jong Un has been ... pretty straight with me,” Trump told reporters at the White House. North Korea has repeatedly criticised the mostly computer- simulated drills in recent weeks, as well as South Korea’s import of high-tech weapons such as F-35 stealth jets and the U.S. testing of its intermediate-range cruise missile as threatening and hindering dialogue.  North Korea’s top diplomat called U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a “diehard toxin” on Friday, saying: “We are ready for both dialogue and standoff.” Those remarks came after U.S. envoy on North Korea Stephen Biegun was in Seoul this week to discuss ways to get negotiations back on track. The North kept up its harsh criticism of sanctions imposed because of its nuclear and missile programmes.  “The U.S. should clearly understand that we do not have a lingering attachment on sanctions relief and that we will never barter the strategic security of the country for the sanctions relief,” a commentary on North Korean state media KCNA said on Saturday. South Korea’s NSC called for North Korea to stop escalating military tensions and agreed to make diplomatic efforts to bring it to the negotiating table with the United States as soon as possible, South Korea’s presidential office said in a statement. A senior U.S. administration official said: “We are aware of reports of a missile launch from North Korea and continue to monitor the situation. We are consulting closely with our Japanese and South Korean allies.” Japanese Defence Minister Takeshi Iwaya said North Korea’s missile launches were a clear violation of U.N. resolutions and could not be ignored. He confirmed that the latest missiles fell outside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone and posed no immediate threat to Japan. Tokyo believed the latest projectiles launched by the North were ballistic missiles and had lodged a strong protest with Pyongyang, Japan’s Jiji news agency reported. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JSC) said North Korea had fired what appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles at around 6:45 a.m. and 7:02 a.m. KST on Saturday (2145 and 2202 GMT Friday) from around Sondok in South Hamgyong province. Sondok is the site of a North Korean military airfield.   They flew about 380 km (236 miles) and reached an altitude of about 97 km (60 miles), the JSC said, the highest of all nine North Korean launches so far this year. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two North Korean missiles appeared to be similar to launches in recent weeks.  Japan’s Coast Guard warned shipping not to approach any fallen debris. South Korea decided to scrap an intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan this week over a long-running dispute with Tokyo about South Koreans pressed into forced wartime labour.  Asked if that affected Japan’s ability to gather and analyse information about North Korea, Iwaya said: “The agreement was until November, so we want to continue cooperation with the South Korean and American militaries.” “So we’d like to make that offer to the South Korean side,” he said. South Korea’s JSC said that, as the agreement with Japan had not yet expired, it would share information about the latest North Korean launch with Japan, Yonhap reported.

The United States, which says the tanker is controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, deemed a terrorist group by Washington, has told countries in the region not to assist it. Previous data had shown that the vessel, which is fully laden with oil, was heading to the port of Kalamata in Southern Greece. But new data from MarineTraffic on Saturday showed the vessel will now sail past Greece through the Mediterranean and dock at the southern Turkish port of Mersin on Aug. 31.

4316,Brazil President Bolsonaro sends army to fight Amazon fires,"Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has pledged in an address to the nation to mobilise the army to help combat the forest fires in Amazon. This comes after France and Ireland said they will not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nations unless Brazil does more to fight the fires. Earlier, Bolsonaro told foreign leaders not to interfere.",Reuters,"BRASILIA/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European leaders on Friday threatened to tear up a trade deal with South America, reflecting growing international anger at Brazil as a record number of fires in the Amazon rainforest intensified an unfolding environmental crisis. Amid a global chorus of concern and condemnation, Brazil’s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro pledged in an address to the nation to mobilize the army to help combat the blazes, while his administration launched a diplomatic charm offensive to try to mend bridges overseas. Forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon, which accounts for more than half of the world’s largest rainforest, have surged in number by 83% this year, according to government data, destroying vast swathes of a vital bulwark against global climate change.  French President Emmanuel Macron called for G7 leaders to discuss the environmental crisis in Brazil at a summit this weekend in the French coastal resort of Biarritz. Both France and Ireland threatened to oppose an EU trade deal struck in June with a regional South American bloc following Brazil’s response.   Images of fires raging in the Amazon broadcast around the globe sparked protests outside Brazilian embassies from Mexico City and Lima to London and Paris.  In the Cypriot capital Nicosia, a sign tied to the railings of Brazil’s diplomatic mission read: “The Amazon belongs to Earth not to the Brazilian president.” Bolsonaro, who initially accused non-governmental organizations of setting the forest on fire without providing any evidence, said in a televised address he had authorized the use of troops to fight the fires and stop illegal deforestation in the Amazon. But the former military officer attributed the scale of the fires to dryer-than-average weather and insisted on the need for economic development of the Amazon to improve the lives of its 20 million inhabitants.  Environmentalists have warned that his controversial plans for more agriculture and mining in the region will speed up deforestation. “We have to give the population the opportunity to develop and my government is working for that, with zero tolerance for crime - and that is no different for the environment,” Bolsonaro said in his televised speech. Polls show Brazilians overwhelmingly oppose his policy on the environment and as he spoke to the nation, residents in large cities across Brazil banged on pots and pans in a traditional Latin American form of protest. U.S. President Donald Trump - whose skeptical views on climate change Bolsonaro shares - called the Brazilian president to offer help, if needed, in dealing with the wildfires. “I told him if the United States can help with the Amazon rainforest fires, we stand ready to assist!” Trump said in a post on Twitter. The wildfires now look set to be discussed at the summit of G7 leaders in France this weekend, where Macron has called for leaders to sign a charter to protect biodiversity. The French leader said an “ecocide” was taking place in the Amazon that required an international response.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that the fires were “not only heartbreaking, they are an international crisis,” while a spokeswoman said Johnson would use the summit to call for a renewed focus on protecting nature.  France and Ireland said on Friday they would now oppose the E.U.-Mercosur farming deal struck in June between the European Union and the Mercosur countries of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.  The French president’s office accused Bolsonaro of lying when he downplayed concerns over climate change at the G20 summit in June. “There is no way that Ireland will vote for the EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement if Brazil does not honor its environmental commitments,” Ireland’s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement. The EU-Mercosur deal took 20 years to negotiate, but will not be officially ratified for at least another two years.  Brazilian business leaders also warned the backlash over Brazil’s environmental record could sink its efforts to join the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a Paris-based club of 37 developed nations whose imprimatur is required by many institutional investors.  Stung by the international outcry, Brazil distributed a 12-page circular, exclusively seen by Reuters, to foreign embassies, outlining data and statistics defending the government’s reputation on the environment. Having first dismissed the fires as natural, then blaming non-governmental organizations without evidence for lighting them, Bolsonaro appeared to adopt a more serious approach on Friday following the international outcry, summoning top cabinet members for an afternoon meeting to tailor a response.   Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias insisted that Brazil was “taking care” of the Amazon, and that international concerns over the fires needed to cool down. “The news is worrying, but I think we have to lower the temperature. The Amazon is important, Brazil knows that, and Brazil is taking care of the Amazon,” she told reporters. The Brazilian space agency INPE has registered 72,843 fires this year, the highest number since records began in 2013. More than 9,500 have been spotted by satellites over the past week. Although fires are a regular and natural occurrence during the dry season at this time of year, environmentalists blamed the jump on farmers clearing land for pasture.  Farmers may have had at least tacit encouragement from the firebrand right-wing president, who took power in January.  Bolsonaro has repeatedly said he believes Brazil should open up the Amazon to business interests, allowing mining, agricultural and logging companies to exploit its natural resources. On Thursday, Bolsonaro admitted for the first time that farmers may be behind some of the fires but he responded angrily to what he saw as foreign interference. Some foreign donors - including the biggest, Norway - have slashed their funding to an Amazon Fund designed to curb deforestation in the region in protest at changes introduced by Brazil that blocked its operations. “These countries that send money here, they don’t send it out of charity ... They send it with the aim of interfering with our sovereignty,” Bolsonaro said. Alexandre Antonelli, director of science at Britain’s Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, urged that import sanctions be imposed on Brazil because of the fires.  “Immediate action is necessary to extinguish the current fires and prevent future ones,” the Brazilian scientist said.

4328,Startups registered with DPIIT exempted from 'angel tax',"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said startups registered with Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) will be exempt from so-called 'angel tax', an anti-evasion provision in the Income Tax Act. Startups that received equity infusion in excess of ""fair valuation"" were required to pay angel tax on the ""premium"" paid by investors.",TechCrunch,"India today addressed a long-standing challenge that has been affecting the country’s booming startup ecosystem. As part of a raft of measures to boost overall economic growth from a five-year low, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said New Delhi is exempting startups from Section 56(2) — a provision more popularly known as an “angel tax” in the local income tax laws — that required startups to pay a certain tax if they received an investment at a rate higher than their “fair market valuation.”Local tax authority in India does not recognize the discounted cash flow method that many investors use to value early-stage startups, and instead value the company for what it is worth currently, which as you can imagine, is very little. Investors assess a startup’s value based on what it could eventually become in the future.Prior to today’s announcement, the government levied a 30% tax on affected startups. Sitharaman said any startup that is registered with the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion, a government body, will be exempted from the angel tax. Those not registered will remain subjected to it, she said in a press conference Friday.More than 24,000 startups are currently registered with the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion. The law was originally introduced amid concerns that wealthy people could invest in bogus startups as a way to launder money.“Angel tax was there to stop shell companies from creating capital from nowhere,” Piyush Goyal, a minister for commerce and industry as well as railways, said in a statement Friday.The angel tax, which was introduced in 2012, became a roadblock for many investors who wanted to fund early-stage startups. The announcement today comes weeks after the Narendra Modi government said it would address this issue.Many prominent investors, startup founders, analysts and other industry executives have long publicly criticized the angel tax, telling the government that it is severely hurting the health of the local ecosystem.Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group, said last year that the angel tax needs “immediate attention or else all chances of building a rival to Silicon Valley in India will be lost.”Sreejith Moolayil, a founder of health food startup True Elements, said the existence of an angel tax would leave many entrepreneurs like him with no choice but to shut down their companies.Late last year, India’s tax department sent a flurry of notices to startups demanding them to pay the angel tax on funds they received from individual investors. The notices sparked an uproar, with many calling it “harassment.”“Hope this will address the concerns of DPIIT registered startups. The proposed cell should look into concerns of all startups including those who are already under notice,” said Ashish Aggarwal, who oversees Public Policy at industry body Nasscom, of today’s announcement.The government will also set up a dedicated cell to address other tax problems that startups face, Sitharaman said. “A startup having any income-tax issue can approach the cell for quick resolution,” the ministry said in a statement.Jayanth Kolla, founder and chief analyst at research firm Convergence Catalyst, told TechCrunch earlier that the angel tax was the primary reason early-stage startups in the nation were struggling to raise money from investors.Even as Indian tech startups raised a record $10.5 billion in 2018, early-stage startups saw a decline in the number of deals they participated in and the amount of capital they received. Early-stage startups participated in 304 deals in 2018 and raised $916 million in funds last year, down from $988 million they raised from 380 rounds in 2017 and $1.096 billion they raised from 430 deals the year before, research firm Venture Intelligence told TechCrunch.Sitharaman also announced the country was scrapping a recently introduced additional levy on foreign funds. The government would revoke the surcharge, which increased tax on foreign companies investing in India to over 40%, she said. She also promised to pay out all pending tax refunds owed to small and medium enterprises within 30 days. Companies have long complained that the tax authority takes too much time to refund the money owed to them.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/india-angel-tax/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Amazon has since confirmed the change to Engadget. Perhaps more importantly, the e-commerce giant will no longer dip into drivers' tips to cover their base pay. LA Times reported earlier this year that the company used drivers' supplemental earnings to fulfill the $18-to-$25-per-hour base pay they're guaranteed.The delivery drivers weren't aware of the practice due to the lack of transparency. They weren't told how much of the money they get came from tips, so some of them had to experiment by ordering items themselves to figure out what was going on.

""Just trying to think of who would've convinced Kohli to read it,"" a user tweeted. ""Wondering what is his take away,"" wrote another.",CricTracker,"Ever since Virat Kohli has taken up the captaincy of the Indian team, there have been several talks about his aggressive behaviour. While this has helped him get the best out of the team in the initial phases, things have turned quite awkward later on.The ‘Anil Kumble Episode’ was one of those instances where there were talks about his ego-centric behaviour. The fallout between the two individuals was definitely not a pleasant one for the onlookers. Then, he was also adamant about having Ravi Shastri as the head coach of the team.AdvertisementOver the last two years, there have been several incidents on a leadership front that have tainted his image. The most recent of all is the reports of the rift between him and Rohit Sharma. Apparently, the Indian limited-overs vice-captain wasn’t too impressed with Kohli’s captaincy in the World Cup 2019. Many of his moves were questionable and this debacle only intensified after the exit from the tournament in the semi-final game.The Indian skipper, who has been an absolute beast with the bat, has received a lot of criticism about his leadership in the last few weeks. Now, he has only added fire to the fuel by reading the book ‘Detox your Ego’. In the first Test between Windies and India, Virat Kohli got out early on Day-1. After hitting a couple of beautiful boundaries, he tried to chase a wide delivery from Shannon Gabriel.He never bothered to keep that ball on the ground and hit it in the air. However, a slight bit of extra bounce got the better of him and the ball carried straight to the gully fielder. With India still continuing to bat on Day-2, Virat had some break between he takes the field again for the first innings of Windies.In the meanwhile, he decided to make the most of his time by reading a book.

Moreover, the bowler struck the Australian batsmen on the body for as many as 13 times in the match with Steve Smith facing the toughest bouncer which ruled him out of the ongoing third Ashes Test.Archer has continued to rule the Ashes series and picked up a sensational six-wicket haul on the first day of the Leeds Test. His well-directed bouncers at pace and the tight line and length has made the Aussie batsmen tough for him to tackle. It seems that the Caribbean-born bowler will take a wicket off almost every delivery.AdvertisementWith the Ashes in progress, no wonder, the former cricketers from both the countries also get themselves into a banter on social media and Kevin Pietersen seems to have started by taking a hilarious dig at Australia.

Mark Cosgrove, the 35-year-old Australian cricketer, comes down the track even as Ben Raine completes his bowling run-up. Looking at him come down the pitch, the bowler delivers a bouncer which Cosgrove heads it with his helmet.While it is extremely dangerous for a batsman to do this as it could hurt him. Even the umpire could be seen calling for the physio to check if Cosgrove was fine. Pietersen, however, took this opportunity to troll the Aussie batsmen and advised them to check if they can employ this strategy to see of Archer.Meanwhile, Jofra Archer’s six-wicket haul has helped England bundle Australia out for a paltry 179 runs in the first innings of the third Test after Joe Root won the toss and opted to field first.

Besides playing in the same era, the ‘Fab Four’ have been dragged into several Conflict of Interest allegations which has brought the contentious issue in the spotlight.READ: Surprised that India didn’t pick Ashwin and Rohit – GangulyTendulkar and Laxman were the first to receive Conflict of Interest complaints against them for their dual roles as Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) members as well as mentor/icon of their respective Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises – Mumbai Indians and Sunrisers Hyderabad.READ: Rathour over Bangar unanimous but not straightforwardGanguly was the next to face the music for being the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president as well as the mentor of Delhi Capitals. Dravid was the last among to receive a complaint for being the NCA Director and also employed as vice-president of India Cements group, which owns IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings.Ganguly, who has earlier voiced his resentment against the clause, has called for more clarity, rather than creating exceptions for certain cricketers.“I wouldn’t say an exception be made to the rule, but the rule has to be practical,” Ganguly said on the sidelines of an event. “What is conflict of interest? Today Rahul Dravid is appointed NCA head and there are issues about his conflict of interest of his job with India Cements, so you got to be practical on that. You never know whether you would become NCA head or not. Three years later, you may not remain the NCA head, but these jobs are permanent.”The left-handed batsman-turned-commentator does not see his commentary stint with a renowned broadcaster as a conflict. “Even when you do commentary or coaching, I don’t see it as a conflict of interest. Look at Ricky Ponting, he coaches Australia and commentates. In the month of April next year, he will be with Delhi Capitals (as a coaching staff). I really don’t consider this as a conflict of interest because these are skill-based. You get picked because of your skill. Conflict of Interest has to be more precise otherwise everything is going to be conflict,” he explained.Ganguly also reckoned Vikram Rathour, now leading the race to be the next batting coach to replace the incumbent Sanjay Bangar, has no conflict of interest. Rathour’s appointment has come under the scanner as he faces a potential Conflict of Interest charge since his brother-in-law Aashish Kapoor is the Junior Chairman of selectors.“I was reading in the newspaper that Vikram too is now facing conflict with Aashish Kapoor being a junior selector. I find it ridiculous. If somebody else is a junior selector and somebody else is batting coach, how does it create an influence and how does it become a conflict? These things need to be a bit clearer. I am a firm believer that skills have to be kept separate because you cannot influence skills.

The team's previous bowling coach was former cricketer Azhar Mahmood.,Cricket Country,"Waqar Younis has reportedly applied for the post of the Pakistan bowling coach, submitting his application with the national cricket board.Waqar has been associated with Pakistan as their coach twice in the past with the most recent stint coming between 2014 and 2016.

4359,Not a selfish guy: Ajinkya Rahane on missing out century,"India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, who smashed 81(163) on day one of the first Test against West Indies, said he always thinks about the team as long as he is at the crease. ""I'm not a selfish guy...I'm not too concerned about...hundred as I thought 81 on that wicket was really crucial,"" he added. India ended the day at 203/6.",Cricket Country,"Ajinkya Rahane was at the forefront of India’s revival on the opening day of the Antigua Test against West Indies on Thursday. Put to bat, India were reduced to 25/3 before a crucial partnership between Rahane and KL Rahul added stability to the innings. Rahane top scored with 81 – his gritty knock helping India finish on 203/6 – but missed out on a ninth Test century after being bowled by Shannon GabrielREAD: Rahane helps India recover after shaky startIt’s been over two years since Rahane notched up a three-digit score in Tests – his last hundred coming against Sri Lanka in August 2017 – but it wasn’t something he is losing his sleep over.“I knew this question was coming and I was ready. As long as I am at the crease, I am thinking about my team, I am not a selfish guy. So yes, I am not too concerned about the hundred as I thought 81 on that wicket was really crucial as we are now in a decent position,” Rahane said at stumps on Day 1.AS IT HAPPENED | SCORECARD“See, as long as I am contributing for my team is what matters. Yes, I was thinking about my hundred but the situation we are in – 25/3 was tricky. As I have said, I just thought if I could contribute for my team. I am not too concerned about my hundred as that will come automatically.”That India were able to post a recovery after their top three were dismissed cheaply was due to the 68-run partnership between Rahane and Rahul. At one stage, Rahane was 1 off 32 before scoring his first boundary off Jason Holder, who kept India on their toes with three maidens on the trot. Rahane brought up his fifty off 116 balls and even though the visitors lost Rahul shortly after tea, it was that fourth-wicket stand which set the base for India’s recovery.“At the start of our innings, the wicket was tricky. It was a bit sticky (spongy bounce) and there was sideways movement. Throughout the day, they bowled pretty well,” Rahane said. “What was important was to have a partnership going and still be positive in our intent. The partnership with Rahul was crucial at that situation. We were not thinking too far ahead. The motive was to play one ball at a time and take it on from there,” Rahane said about their gameplan.”However, it wasn’t the only notable stand of the day. After Roston Chase dismissed Rahul for 44 to snap the partnership, another association blossomed between Rahane and Hanuma Vihari as the two batsmen put on 82 runs for the fifth wicket. For Rahane, the idea was to hang in there for as long as possible since he and India were playing Test cricket after a gap of eight months.“Vihari is a guy who has got lots of runs in Ranji Trophy and first-class cricket, and he knows how to bat in these situations. So all these guys, who play a lot of India A games know how to bat in these conditions in five-day games. So I thought Vihari’s approach was pretty good, not only here but even in Australia,” he said.“For me, it was important as we were playing a Test match after a long time, nearly seven months (vs Australia in January) and I wanted to hang in there, play as many balls possible and take my team to good position.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/india-vs-west-indies-1st-test-day-1-not-too-concerned-about-missing-out-on-century-ajinkyar-ahane-883055?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4363,Self-folding robot inspired by origami changes shape with temp,"Researchers from Harvard and Caltech have developed self-folding robots that can be 'passively controlled' with temperature, called 'Rollbot'. The soft robotic systems, inspired by origami, can move and change shape in response to external stimuli, paving the way for fully untethered soft robots. Future versions of the robots could be controlled by factors like light, pH or humidity, Harvard said.",Engadget,"Soft robots have potential applications in everything from space exploration to health care, as they're able to change shape depending on the needs of their environment. Most soft robots need to be ""tethered"" though, meaning they need to be attached to a cable which supplies compressed air or instructions. Now, a team of scientists has come up with an untethered soft robot which is able to change its shape in response to heat.In a new paper in Science Robotics, a team from Caltech describe using sets of folds like origami to create a flexible soft robot. They created two different type of hinges which fold at different temperatures, so when the robot is heated it folds in a specific order.The advantage of the hinges is that they allow the robot to be configured into different shapes but within set parameters. Other soft robots have blobby bodies which are difficult to predict and control, but the hinging robots only need to be deformed in the small area of the hinge.One robot they made using this technique is the Rollbot, which begins as a flat sheet 8 centimeters by 4 centimeters in size. When the Rollbot is placed onto a hot surface, its hinges fold and it becomes a pentagonal wheel.When the Rollbot has achieved its wheel shape, its sides come into contact with the hot surface and hinge out another set of panels which push the robot forward. The robot can roll essentially autonomously.""These untethered structures can be passively controlled,"" Arda Kotikian, a graduate student at Caltech's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, explained. ""In other words, all we need to do is expose the structures to specific temperature environments, and they will respond according to how we programmed the hinges.""While these robots are controlled with temperature, future versions could be controlled by other factors like light, pH or humidity. Being able to manipulate active materials in this way ""enables the design and fabrication of entirely new classes of soft robotic matter,"" according to Jennifer A. Lewis, Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at Caltech.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/23/rollbot-soft-robots-heat/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tLw&guccounter=1&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA6DIAnDjT2GgaFHOijO-vXg2kx9vWk7daSclSs6lC6dlxjyjOz5lPr7ZBP2EDh9TxjFnUKn_7LtN2ppfbnhXTYJvK60TK4ou9Paj81QXgYlZosDJo3o0QLVr7ZgrNpsaiLQe_j6vvfGy5mhYC-wXQwrNVlWtNESQk67LBGx0YSb&utm_source=inshorts

Ping is said to be looking to raise a valuation of between $2 billion and $3 billion in this listing. The company, founded in 2002, was acquired by Vista Equity in 2016 for $600 million.",TechCrunch,"Some eight months after it was reported that Ping Identity’s owners Vista Equity had hired bankers to explore a public listing, today Ping Identity took the plunge: the Colorado-based online ID management company has filed an S-1 form indicating that it plans to raise up to $100 million in an IPO on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker “Ping.”While the initial S-1 filing doesn’t have an indication of price range, Ping is said to be looking at a valuation of between $2 billion and $3 billion in this listing.The company has been around since 2001, founded by Andre Durand (who is still the CEO), and it was acquired by Vista in 2016 for about $600 million — at a time when a clutch of enterprise companies that looked like strong IPO candidates were going the private equity route and staying private instead.But more recently, there has been a surge in demand for better IT security linked to identity and authentication management, so it seems that Vista Equity is selling up. The PE firm is taking advantage of the fact that the market’s currently very strong for tech IPOs, but there is so much M&A in enterprise right now (just yesterday VMware acquired not one but two companies, Carbon Black for $2.1 billion and Pivotal for $2.7 billion) that I can’t help but wonder if something might move here too.The S-1 reveals a number of details on the company’s financials, indicating that it’s currently unprofitable but on a steady growth curve. Ping had revenues of $112.9 million in the first six months of 2019, versus $99.5 million in the same period a year before. Its loss has been shrinking in recent years, with a net loss of $3.1 million in the first six months of this year versus $5.8 million a year before (notably in 2017 overall it was profitable with a net income of $19 million. It seems that the change is due to acquisitions and investing for growth).Its annual run rate, meanwhile, was $198 million for the first six months of the year, compared to $159.6 million in the same period a year ago.The area of identity and access management has become a cornerstone of enterprise IT, with companies looking for efficient and secure ways to centralise how not just their employees, but their customers, their partners and various connected devices on their networks can be authenticated across their cloud and on-premise applications.The demand for secure solutions covering all the different aspects of a company’s IT stack has grown rapidly over recent years, spurred not just by an increased move to centralised applications served through the cloud, but also by the drastic rise in breaches where malicious hackers have exploited vulnerabilities and loopholes in companies’ sign-on screens.Ping has been one of the bigger companies building services in this area and tackling all of those use cases, competing with the likes of Okta, OneLogin, AuthO, Cisco and dozens more off-the-shelf and custom-built solutions.The company offers its services on an SaaS basis, covering services like secure sign-on, multi-factor authentication, API access security, personalised and unified profile directories, data governance and AI-based security policies. It claims to be the pioneer of “Intelligent Identity,” using AI to help its system analyse user, device and network behavior to better identify potentially malicious activity.More to come.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/ping-identity-files-for-100m-ipo/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The units are far from schools and often in isolated locations surrounded by crime or antisocial behaviour. More than 1.2 lakh children are officially homeless, while 90,000 are estimated to be ""sofa-surfing"", the report added.",Times Now,"London: A report by the Children's Commissioner for England on the terrible living conditions of many homeless families who have been put up in repurposed shipping containers and office blocks has triggered a massive controversy.The report, titled Bleak Houses, released on Wednesday and detailed that around 120,000 children were living in temporary accommodation while almost 90,000 children were 'sofa surfing' in the UK. The commissioner warned the converted office blocks and shipping containers - which are frequently being used as a temporary accommodation - are often not fit to live in.As per the report, the use of shipping containers as temporary accommodation was resulting in cramped conditions and inhospitable temperatures.The report also noted that units were not designed in a child-friendly manner and often had items such ovens and other appliances dangerously close to the ground and within easy reach of young children.As per the Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, who visited the homeless children, said, ""Office block conversions, in which whole families live in single rooms barely bigger than a parking space, and shipping containers which are blisteringly hot in summer and freezing in the winter months.""  Reports said that Ealing Council was one of the councils using ""heavily modified"" shipping container to provide temporary residences in west London.Reportedly, the steel containers have a kitchenette, shower room and bedroom. Frequently, they are being used to house people who would otherwise stay in B&Bs and other interim housing. The Council said that it had to resort to the strategy of using shipping containers as houses owing to the wider housing crisis. Reportedly, councils have blamed £159m funding gap for the use of such newer techniques to house people who are homeless or are in need of temporary accommodation.Lulu Abubakar, who lives with her four children in one of the shipping container-turned-home in West London, told a British news channel that she felt that they were being treated ""worse than animals.""  One of her kids is a child with special needs, for whom Lulu says it’s especially difficult living in such confined spaces. “This is a cargo container, this is not a house, not a BnB, this is a container. It's where people keep their storage. We are not animals, we are not storage or furniture. We are human. This is just ridiculous,” she was quoted as saying. She added, “It's a prison having children here, they have a playground - kids can go - but my special needs child, he's locked in here.”

4380,US billionaire industrialist David Koch passes away aged 79,"US industrialist David Koch, who ran Koch Industries with his brother Charles Koch, died on Friday aged 79. Koch, whose wealth Bloomberg estimates at $59 billion, was a philanthropist and a major financier of conservative causes and political candidates. He derived most of his wealth from a 42% stake in Koch Industries, which has annual revenue of about $110 billion.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire industrialist David Koch, a driving force behind conglomerate Koch Industries who as one of the world’s richest people became a major financier of conservative causes and political candidates, has died at age 79, his brother said on Friday. Charles Koch, Koch Industries Inc’s chairman, disclosed the death in a statement that touched on his younger brother’s lengthy battle with prostate cancer and his philanthropic contributions to medical research, education and the arts.   “He will be greatly missed, but never forgotten,” Koch said in a statement addressed to employees. “David was proud of the extraordinary work you all have done to make Koch Industries the successful company that it is today.”  Koch, a philanthropist and patron of cultural and medical institutions, amassed his vast wealth with a large ownership stake in Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kansas-based company he ran with Charles. With Charles as chairman and chief executive and David as executive vice president, Koch Industries - one of the world’s largest privately held businesses - aggressively expanded beyond the oil refining business their father created into an array of new ventures.  David Koch stepped down from the business and political activities in June 2018, citing declining health. He and his brother Charles, both Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained engineers, spent hundreds of millions of dollars to back conservative causes and Republican political candidates. They were fierce critics of Democratic President Barack Obama but failed in their bid to stop him from being re-elected in 2012. The brothers funded groups like Americans for Prosperity that spread their libertarian vision of conservatism advocating lower taxes and fewer regulations on businesses, and donated heavily to Republican candidates. Critics said the brothers used their riches to buy political influence and peddle positions that would benefit them financially. The Kochs were no fans of businessman-turned-politican Donald Trump and backed rivals for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Once Trump was nominated by the party, the brothers redirected their political donations toward congressional races rather than the presidential election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Koch brothers strongly opposed Trump’s protectionist trade policies, which abandoned free trade deals, aimed tariffs at close U.S. allies and picked fights with major trade partners like China. David and Charles Koch (pronounced “Coke”) each were worth $58.7 billion, ranking 7th and 8th on the list of the world’s richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Their combined wealth exceeded that of the world’s richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Their father, Fred Koch, founded Koch Industries and built gas plants in Josef Stalin’s Soviet Union before becoming an ardent anti-communist and a founder of the archconservative John Birch Society. In 1991, David survived a plane collision in Los Angeles that killed 34 people. After landing, his USAir flight from Ohio slammed into a SkyWest commuter plane on the runway. “I felt that the good Lord spared my life for a purpose. And since then, I’ve been busy doing all the good works I can think of,” Koch told New York magazine in 2010. David, a 6-foot-5-inch (2-meter) former star of the MIT basketball team, was a familiar figure at cultural events in New York City, joined by his wife, Julia, 23 years his junior. Koch donated more than $1 billion in his lifetime. He gave hundreds of millions of dollars to medical facilities, art and natural history museums and the New York City Ballet. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children. Koch ran unsuccessfully for U.S. vice president in 1980 - running to the right of conservative hero Ronald Reagan - on a long-shot Libertarian Party ticket that called for abolishing income taxes, minimum wage laws, government regulatory agencies, the Social Security retirement program, the FBI and the CIA. Under the leadership of John and David, Koch Industries was involved in oil refining, chemicals, biofuels, pipelines, commodities trading, ranching, fertilizer and paper. It made well-known everyday products such as Dixie disposable cups, Brawny paper towels, Quilted Northern toilet paper, Stainmaster carpet and stretchy Lycra fabric. David guided the chemical equipment side of his company from his home in New York while Charles remained in Wichita. The two brothers each owned 42 percent of Koch Industries. The Koch brothers helped back the conservative Tea Party movement that arose after Obama took office and tenaciously fought his policies, including the 2010 Obamacare healthcare law that reduced the number of Americans without medical insurance by millions. Koch was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1992 and underwent radiation treatment, surgery and hormone therapy.    The experience prompted him to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to medical institutions, including MIT, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. David Koch was embroiled in a bitter family feud that erupted in 1980 in which his fraternal twin, Bill, and another brother, Frederick, accused David and Charles of cheating them out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Two decades of court battles ensued. Their mother disinherited Bill and Frederick before her death. During one courtroom showdown in 1998, David sobbed on the witness stand while describing his broken relationship with his twin. After a legal settlement with undisclosed terms in 2001 resolved the feud, the twins restored their relationship, and David served as best man when Bill married his third wife. Koch married his wife Julia in 1996.  She recalled his dedication to their family on Friday, describing Koch as a father whose “sensitive heart had him shed a tear at the beauty of his daughter’s ballet, and beam with pride when his son beat him at chess. We will miss the fifth link in our family.” Reporting by Will Dunham and Steve Holland; Writing by Makini Brice; editing by Bill Trott and Jonathan Oatis",https://in.reuters.com/article/people-david-koch/billionaire-industrialist-david-koch-has-died-idINKCN1VD1DI?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The US on Monday had tested a missile with a range of more than 500 kms. Such tests were banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia, which the US quit earlier this month.",Reuters,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday ordered a like-for-like response to a recent U.S. missile test, which he said showed that Washington aimed to deploy previously banned missiles around the world. The Pentagon said on Monday it had tested a conventionally-configured cruise missile that hit its target after more than 500 km (310 miles) of flight, its first such test since the demise of a landmark nuclear pact this month.  Washington formally withdrew from the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) on Aug. 2 after accusing Moscow of violating it, a charge dismissed by the Kremlin. The pact had prohibited land-based missiles with a range of 310-3,400 miles, reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike at short notice. Putin told his Security Council on Friday that Russia could not stand idly by, and that U.S. talk of deploying new missiles in the Asia-Pacific region “affects our core interests as it is close to Russia’s borders”. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said this month he was in favor of placing ground-launched intermediate-range missiles in Asia relatively soon, and Putin complained this week that the United States was now in a position to deploy its new land-based missile in Romania and Poland.  “All this leaves no doubts that the real intention of the United States (in exiting the INF pact) was to ... untie its hands to deploy previously banned missiles in different regions of the world,” said Putin.  “We have never wanted, do not want and will not be drawn into a costly, economically destructive arms race. That said, in the light of unfolding circumstances, I’m ordering the Defence Ministry, the Foreign Ministry and other appropriate agencies to analyze the threat to our country posed by U.S. actions, and to take exhaustive measures to prepare a reciprocal response.”  Despite his order, Putin said Russia remained open to talks with the United States aimed at restoring trust and strengthening international security. The United States has said it has no imminent plans to deploy new land-based missiles in Europe.

Under it, the VP and the cabinet, if they vote by a majority, can write Congress saying the president is unable to discharge his office. A two thirds vote in each chamber would be required to remove him.As it happens, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley sent out an odd tweet about Pence Wednesday.  Wrote Haley: 'Enough of the false rumors. Vice President Pence has been a dear friend of mine for years. He has been a loyal and trustworthy VP to the President. He has my complete support,' she said. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley called out 'false rumors' about Mike Pence in a tweet she did not otherwise explain. The vice president has a role outlined in the 25th Amendment processAnother twitter user, James Michael Sama, wrote Wedensday: 'If you were having a conversation with someone and they randomly looked to the sky mid-sentence and said ""I am the chosen one"" you'd probably pull up Web MD on your phone immediately. But, when it's the current president, it's just another day in Washington. #25thAmendmentNow User Josh Jordan, who goes by @NumbersMuncher, chimed in: 'When you hop on Twitter and see Antichrist, King of Israel, Second Coming of God, and #disloyaljews all trending. Oh - and #25thAmendmentNow is also trending. Don't worry everyone - we're in good, stable hands to lead us through!'Trump also repeated Wednesday his earlier claim that Jews who vote for Democrats are 'disloyal.' Said Trump: 'In my opinion you vote for a Democrat you’re being very disloyal to Jewish people and you’re being very disloyal to Israel, and only weak people would say anything other than that.'The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution deals with presidential authority in the event of death or removal from office, and was ratified in 1967, in the wake of John F Kennedy's assassination.What does the 25th Amendment say?It is in four sections, all dealing with the president leaving office during his or her elected term. The first section states that the vice president takes over the Oval Office if the president dies or resigns – or is removed – something which the original Constitution did not clearly state.Presidents of course can be removed by impeachment, a feature of the constitution from the start. They can also be removed through the 25th Amendment - of which more below.Section II states that if the vice president dies, or resigns – or is fired – both the House and Senate have to confirm a new vice president. Until 1967, presidents could change vice presidents mid-term on their own if they got the vice president to agree to resign - not something that actually happened, but which was possible in principle.Section III makes clear that the a president can temporarily delegate his powers to the vice president, and later reclaim them when he - or she - is capable of serving. This is most often invoked if a president is under the influence of surgical anesthetic for a short period of time. Section IV is the amendment's most controversial part: it describes how the president can be removed from office if he is incapacitated and does not leave on his own.The vice president and 'a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide' must write to both the president pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, saying that 'the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.'The term principal officers of the executive departments would normally would mean the cabinet secretaries.So at least eight of the president's 15 most senior Cabinet members, who , together with the vice president, must agree that a president should be removed before any plan can move forward.Notifying the House Speaker and the Senate president pro tempore is the act that immediately elevates the vice president to an 'acting president' role.The deposed president can contest the claim, giving the leaders of the bloodless coup four days to re-assert their claims to the House and Senate. Congress then has two days to convene – unless it is already in session – and another 21 days to vote on whether the president is incapable of serving. A two-thirds majority in both houses is required to make that determination.As soon as there is a vote with a two-thirds majority, the president loses his powers and is removed, and the vice president stops acting and is sworn in as president.But if 21 days of debate and votes ends without a two-thirds majority, the president gets back his powers.What could happen to trigger the 25th Amendment?Vice President Mike Pence and eight of the 15 'principal' Cabinet members would have to agree to notify Congress that President Donald Trump was incapable of running the country.That group is made up of the Secretary of State, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of Defense , Attorney General, Interior Secretary, Agriculture Secretary, Commerce Secretary, Labor Secretary, Health and Human Services Secretary, Transportation Secretary, Energy Secretary , Education Secretary, Veterans Affairs Secretary and Homeland Security Secretary.Their formal notification would go to the House Speaker and, in the senate, to the 'president pro tempore', the Senate's most senior member. As soon as the letter is sent, Pence would become 'acting president.'Alternatively, Congress could set up its own mechanism to decide if he is fit for office - maybe a commission, or a joint committee. Pence would still have to agree with its conclusion and then write formally to the Speaker and president pro tempore.Or another possibility is that the pool of 'principal officers' is considered to be bigger than the 15 and a majority of that group call Trump incapable.What if Trump does not agree?If Trump claims he is capable of holding office, he would write to the House Speaker and the president pro tempore of the Senate within four days, setting up three weeks of intense debate in both houses of Congress.Trump would be removed from office if both two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate agreed with Pence and his cabal. If either of both chambers fell short of that mark, Trump would retain his powers and likely embark on a wholesale housecleaning, firing Pence and replacing disloyal Cabinet members.Are there any loopholes?The 25th Amendment allows Congress to appoint its own panel to evaluate the president instead of relying on the Cabinet – the men and women who work most closely with Trump – to decide on  a course of action.It specfies that some 'other body as Congress may by law provide' could play that role, but Pence would still need to agree with any finding that the president is incapable of discharging his duties.If Democrats were to take over both the House and Senate, they could create such a panel with simple majority votes. That commission could hypothetically include anyone from presidential historians to psychiatrists, entrusted to assess the president's fitness for office. Another loophole is that it does not spell out that the Cabinet is needed to agree, but says that the 'principal officers' of the departments are needed. That term is undefined in the constitution. In some departments legislation appears to name not just the secretary but deputies and even undersecretaries as 'principal officers', so many more people could be called in to the assessment of Trump's fitness. Could Trump fire Pence if he rebelled?Yes, in principle.  If Trump smelled a whiff of trouble – if Pence and a cabal of Cabinet members, or Pence and a panel assembled by Congress seemed ready to judge him incapacitated – he could dismiss his vice president with the stroke of a pen to stop the process.But installing a more loyal VP could be problematic since the 25th Amendment includes its own poison pill: Both houses of Congress must vote to approve a new vice president.That means Trump would find himself up against the same Congress that would vote on his fitness for office, unless the process were to unfold in the weeks before a new Congress.Theoretically, a Democratic-controlled Congress could make life dramatically more difficult for the president if it came into power in the midst of the constitutional crisis. One scenario has appeared to stump presidential historians, however: Firing Pence before the process is underway, and then leaving the vice presidency vacant, would give Congress no practical way forward. That would present its own constitutional crisis.Is there any precedent for this?No.  Only Section III, the voluntary surrender of presidential powers, has ever been used - and only very briefly.In December 1978, President Jimmy Carter thought about invoking Section III when he was contemplating a surgical procedure to remove hemorrhoids. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both voluntarily relinquished their powers while undergoing procedures under anesthetic. Section IV has also never been invoked, although there have been claims that Ronald Reagan's chief of staff Donald Regan told his successor, Howard Baker,  in 1987 that he should be prepared to invoke it because Reagan was inattentive and inept.The PBS documentary 'American Experience' recounts how Baker and his team watched Reagan closely for signs of incapacity during their first meeting and decided he was in perfect command of himself.  He added: 'If you vote for a Democrat, you’re very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.' Trump told Medal of Honor recipient Woody Williams at an event in Kentucky Wednesday: 'That was a big day, Medal of Honor. Nothing like the Medal of Honor,' recalling the ceremony.He added: 'I wanted one, but they told me I don't qualify, Woody. I said, 'Can I give it to myself anyway?' They said, 'I don't think that's a good idea.'”The medal is usually given out in a solemn ceremony. Trump did not serve in Vietnam and received multiple deferments.  ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7381269/25thAmendmentnow-trends-Twitter-Donald-Trump-proclaimed-chosen-one.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

""This isn't our issue and we wouldn't want to get involved,"" he added.",RT,"“This is not our business. We do not engage in this kind of international shopping,” Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Thursday when asked about the Greenland debacle. The leaders of the two countries have been exchanging some irritated remarks lately after US President Donald Trump’s suggestion to purchase the Arctic island from its current sovereign was turned down.“If we get this right, they have been rubbing each other the wrong way to some degree,” Peskov said. “Again, this is not our issue and we wouldn’t want to get involved.”Trump’s offer to buy Greenland from Denmark surfaced last week, but the European nation simply said it was not for sale. A few days and jokes later Trump suddenly canceled his scheduled visit to Denmark, which many of its subjects took as an insult. In his latest move Trump doubled down by calling Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen “nasty” for publicly saying Greenland was not for sale.Like this story?

He also said that companies had been unable to export their products because they were mediocre, mainly because they tried to make everything.According to Bajaj, the auto industry was now correcting stocks after having built up an inventory in September 2018.

He was ignored.The SP-Congress alliance failed miserably and BJP's Yogi Adityanath replaced Akhilesh Yadav as Uttar Pradesh chief minister.In 2019 Lok Sabha polls too, Mulayam had advised him against forming the BSP alliance for the Lok Sabha.The veteran leader's advice was not heeded to again.In 2017, Akhilesh had harped upon development agenda during his stint to attract voters.

A European Union official also opposed Russia's readmission. US President Donald Trump had said it would be ""appropriate"" to have Russia rejoin what used to be the G8.",Reuters,"KIEV/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ukraine’s president backed leading European powers on Thursday in opposing the readmission of Russia to the Group of Seven advanced economies, saying Moscow still occupied Crimea and was frustrating peace in eastern Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday it would be “appropriate” to have Russia rejoin what used to be the G8. France will host a meeting of G7 leaders this weekend. But Germany, France, Britain — all G7 members — quickly rebuffed Trump, noting that Russia was excluded after it annexed Ukraine’s Crimea and then backed an anti-Kiev rebellion in the industrial region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. “Nothing has changed since March, 2014, when Russia’s participation in the G8 was stopped. Ukrainian Crimea is being occupied as before, Ukrainian Donbas is suffering from war,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Echoing that view, a European Union official said readmitting Russian President Vladimir Putin to the group without conditions would be “counterproductive, a sign of weakness”. “The EU remains strongly of the view that the reasons for Russia’s exclusion in 2014 from the then-G8 are still valid today as they were valid five years ago. So the EU will be against the idea of reinviting Russia to G7,” he said. The EU and the United States have imposed sanctions on Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict, in which some 13,000 people have been killed to date, according to U.N. data. Fighting continues in Donbas, albeit at a low intensity. A peace process brokered by Berlin and Paris has stalled. Speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, Britain’s new prime minister, Boris Johnson, also cited the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in England last year as a reason not to readmit Russia to the G7.  Britain and the EU blamed Russia for that attack. The Kremlin denied any involvement. Zelenskiy thanked Johnson in a telephone call for supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty, the Ukrainian president’s office said on Thursday.  The disagreement over how to handle Russia - where Trump has praised Putin despite Western criticism of his record - is just one of several areas of tension in trans-Atlantic ties that will be on display at the G7 gathering in France. The G7 groups the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.

Ahmad was pelted with eggs and punched. The assault took place when he came out from a hotel after attending an awards ceremony to smoke a cigar.",Times Now,"London: Pakistan Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad was on Tuesday allegedly assaulted by two officials of the Pakistan People's Party in London who pelted him with eggs and punched him as well.The assault took place when Rashid, who is also the chief of Awami Muslim League (AML), came out from a hotel after attending an awards ceremony in London to smoke a cigar. After the incident, the attackers had allegedly fled the scene. However, on Wednesday, two officials of the PPP in UK - Asif Ali Khan and Samah Namaz - declared in a statement that they were responsible for the attack. The two claimed that they had assaulted the Pakistan minister as he had been using ""abusive language"" for PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Speaking on this, AML's UK president, Saleem Sheikh, told a Pakistani news portal that he would be seeking Rashid's permission to lodge a police case in the matter. He said, ""We saw Asif Khan and a woman being involved in the attack but they ran away from the scene and there was no video proof of their shameful act but now both have come out and claimed the attack. We will decide whether to report them to the police or not after speaking to Sheikh Rashid Ahmad.”Sheikh also claimed that the attack was ""pre-planned"" as not many people knew that Rashid would use the side exit of the building to step out after the event. Meanwhile, Asif Khan and Samah Naz have alleged that Rashid had been using ""abusive language"" against Bilawal. They said in a statement, ""He has been using abusive and bad language during interviews against our Chairman Mr Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.

4438,Ready for both dialogue and confrontation with US: North Korea,"North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said the country is ready for both dialogue and confrontation with the US. Continuing with sanctions would be a miscalculation, Ri warned. He also accused US State Secretary Mike Pompeo of casting ""dark shadows"" over US-North Korea talks, claiming that Pompeo was more interested in his own political ambitions.",Reuters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s top diplomat said on Friday that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was a “diehard toxin” who only complicates denuclearisation talks and North Korea was ready for both dialogue and standoff.  Talks aimed at dismantling the North’s nuclear and missile programs have stalled since a failed second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi in February. Trump and Kim met again in June at the inter-Korean border and agreed to reopen working-level negotiations, but that has not happened. Since the Vietnam summit, North Korea has demanded that Pompeo be replaced with a “more mature” person, while lauding the rapport built between Kim and Trump. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, who took part in the Hanoi summit along with Pompeo, called the chief U.S. negotiator the “diehard toxin of the U.S. diplomacy” who employs “hackneyed sanctions rhetoric”. Ri referred to Pompeo’s remarks in recent press interviews in which he said sanctions would be kept until North Korea takes concrete actions on denuclearisation. “He is truly impudent enough to utter such thoughtless words which only leave us disappointed and skeptical as to whether we can solve any problem with such a guy,” Ri said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency.  Ri also accused Pompeo of casting “dark shadows” over the talks and being more interested in his political ambitions than in U.S. foreign policy.  “If the U.S. still dreams a pipe dream of gaining everything through sanctions, we are left with two options, either to leave it enjoying the dream to its heart’s content or to wake it up from the dream,” Ri said.  “We are ready for both dialogue and standoff.” U.S. envoy Stephen Biegun, who leads working-level talks with North Korea, was in Seoul this week to discuss ways to get negotiations back on track. Talks were expected to be reopened soon, South Korea’s deputy national security adviser Kim Hyun-chong said on Thursday, giving an upbeat assessment after meeting Biegun. “We look forward to the progress of denuclearisation talks in terms of mutual trust and respect between the U.S. and North Korea, culminating in good results,” said deputy spokesman Kim Eun-han of South Korea’s Unification Ministry on Friday, when asked about Ri’s statement. North Korea has fired a series of short-range missiles in recent weeks in protest against U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises and the adoption of new weapons, complicating the reopening of the talks.

4440,Don't have the resources to fight fires in Amazon: Brazil President,"Amid growing international criticism over the wildfires raging through the Amazon, Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro said, ""Amazon is bigger than Europe, how will you fight criminal fires in such an area? We don't have the resources for that."" Fires in the Amazon have surged 83% so far this year compared with the same period a year earlier, government figures show.",Reuters,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amid growing international criticism over the wildfires raging through the Amazon, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday admitted farmers could be illegally setting the rainforest ablaze but told foreign powers not to interfere. French President Emmanuel Macron and United Nations Secretary General António Guterres both took to Twitter to express concern about the fires that have reached a record number this year, devastating vast swathes of forest considered a vital bulwark against climate change. Bolsonaro responded angrily to what he regarded as meddling. “These countries that send money here, they don’t send it out of charity. ... They send it with the aim of interfering with our sovereignty,” he said in a Facebook Live broadcast. But earlier on Thursday, he said that Brazil alone lacked the resources to control the fires. “The Amazon is bigger than Europe, how will you fight criminal fires in such an area?” he asked reporters as he left the presidential residence. “We do not have the resources for that.” Fires in the Amazon have surged 83% so far this year compared with the same period a year earlier, government figures show.  Although fires are a regular and natural occurrence during the dry season at this time of year, environmentalists blamed the sharp rise on farmers setting the forest alight to clear land for pasture. Farmers may have had at least tacit encouragement from the firebrand right-wing president, who took power in January. Bolsonaro has repeatedly said he believes Brazil should open the Amazon up to business interests, to allow mining, agricultural and logging companies to exploit its natural resources. On Wednesday, he blamed non-governmental organizations for setting the fires, without providing evidence. He appeared to row back on Thursday, when he said for the first time that farmers could be behind the fires. Macron took to Twitter to call the Amazon fires an “international crisis” that should be discussed by the G7 summit that will begin on Saturday in Biarritz, France. The Group of Seven rich countries does not include Brazil. Guterres said he was “deeply concerned” by the fires, adding, “We cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity.”   Federal prosecutors in Brazil said they were investigating a spike in deforestation and wildfires raging in the Amazon state of Pará to determine whether there has been reduced monitoring and enforcement of environmental protections. Prosecutors said they would look into an ad that they said was published in a local newspaper encouraging farmers to participate in a “Fire Day,” in which they would burn large areas of forest “to show Bolsonaro their willingness to work.”  Colombia, home to part of the northern Amazon, on Thursday offered its support in the fight to protect the forest. “Colombian authorities are already working to contain the propagation of these fires toward Colombian territory and we are willing to collaborate with our neighbors in this common cause,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Brazil is facing growing international criticism over its handling of the Amazon, 60% of which lies in the country.   Earlier this month, Norway and Germany suspended funding for projects to curb deforestation in Brazil after becoming alarmed by changes to the way projects were selected under Bolsonaro. At the time, when asked about the loss of German funding, Bolsonaro said, “Brazil does not need that.” Others were less sanguine. Brazil’s lower house speaker, Rodrigo Maia, said on Twitter he would create “an external committee” to monitor the burning of the rainforest, and he vowed to form a group “to evaluate the situation and propose solutions to the government.”     The Bishops Conference for Latin America expressed concern about the “tragedy,” and on Thursday called on countries to take immediate action to protect the rainforest and nearby communities. “We urge the governments of the Amazon countries, especially Brazil and Bolivia, the United Nations and the international community to take serious measures to save the world’s lungs,” it said. Wildfires are also raging in Bolivia, where officials estimate that an area the size of the U.S. state of Delaware has burned in recent days.

Sara further said that she and Janhvi had more in common with each other than they had with other people.",Times Now,"Ever since her entry in filmdom, Sara Ali Khan has been compared with her peers Janhvi Kapoor and Ananya Panday. While Sara, courtesy her amazing screen presence, refreshingly beautiful looks and carefree attitude, has made an impression, Janhvi and Ananya are no lesser and therefore, the comparisons.In a recent chat with Femina, Sara, the daughter of actors Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan, was asked if she was bothered by she being constantly compared to Janhvi, to which she said, “Comparison and competition is part and parcel of our profession. I don’t get bothered; there’s space for everybody here, and both of us are confident and secure in our respective places. We don’t hold anything against each other or the media; we know that it’s part of their job to do what they do. We are here to be actors; nothing works more than individualism.”On being asked if she considers Janhvi or Ananya as her competitors, Sara said whether it was her, Janhvi or Ananya, they had more in common with each other than they had with other people. The actress, who made her big-screen debut with the last year’s Kedarnath, said that the three of them were young debutantes trying to make it big in a world that they had only dreamt of.“I am happy, confident, and content with the place I have, and I am sure they are too. I don’t think we need to treat each other as rivals, but as friends that we already are. Competition in any field keeps you on your toes; it’s a healthy vibe where we can all coexist,” she added.
Sara, whose last release was the Ranveer Singh-starrer Simmba (2018), will be seen next in director Imtiaz Ali’s yet-untitled film, co-starring Kartik Aaryan.

This is the same woman who had earlier accused Karan of rape and extortion. ""She had threatened us with dire consequences and claimed that she was using witchcraft to cause my parents pain,"" Karan's sister said.",Times Now,"Karan Oberoi got himself embroiled in controversy after his ex-girlfriend got him arrested over rape accusations. The actor spent a couple of days in jail and was even proven innocent later on. Karan opened up in the media about his struggles and how she kept blackmailing him constantly. He also accused her of praticing witchcraft. Karan had also filed a complaint against her a couple of months before she got him arrested. Karan's sister has now filed a complaint with the police against his ex-girlfriend for practicing witchcraft. She has also acccused her causing their parents a lot of pain and suffering and that the police has not taken any action yet against her. She told a leading daily, ""Her witchcraft practices are not a new development. My brother had mentioned it in his NC, which he had filed against her in October last year, seven months before she filed the case against him. She had threatened us with dire consequences and claimed that she was using witchcraft to cause my parents pain and suffering. Such women cannot be above the law."" Karan added, ""I have suffered for a long time. While I had clearly mentioned her association with witchcraft in my complaint, no action has been taken against her till date. Practising witchcraft is a serious crime in Maharashtra, and one can’t get away using the gender card. Every time someone gets away with an unlawful practice, it emboldens the others to follow suit. For the good of society, it’s important to keep crime and punishment gender neutral. Initiatives like #MenToo are the need of the hour.""Karan's lawyer, Dinesh Tiwari told the daily, ""Propagating and promoting such theories in any form is illegal and that’s the ground of our complaint. Besides publishing a book on witchcraft and voodoo, she has been propagating it on chat groups and also teaching people. In fact, her lawyer, too, admitted that she indulges in such practises and even claimed to be a victim of it. This is good enough evidence and she is liable to be prosecuted and punished.""Karan had earlier opened up about where he met his ex-girlfriend and said, ""We met on a dating app, where she introduced herself as a healer and astrologer. Then we shifted to WhatsApp and slowly got talking. She did not tell me that she was into witchcraft and voodoo, but I soon realised that something was amiss. She would often tell me that I am a misfit and that I needed someone like her to protect me. These conversations started making me uncomfortable, and finally, she told me that she is a wiccan, who has been practising black magic and occult for years. She told me that she could change my destiny by giving me the power to control anyone in the industry. She also claimed that she could cause irreparable damage to anyone she wants to. So, a few months after meeting her, I told her that I wanted to end our association.

Pakistan had urged the UN to remove Priyanka as the ambassador over her tweet cheering Indian military and alleged that she supports nuclear war.",India.com,"Actor Priyanka Chopra was under immense criticism from Pakistan for speaking in support of the Indian armed forces in a tweet made in February this year. After Pakistan’s Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari wrote to the UNICEF demanding the removal of PC as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, a lot was being said and discussed online. Now, putting a rest to all the issues, UNICEF has made its stand clear. In an official statement, a UNICEF spokesperson said that UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors have a right to speak on the issues that concern them and that doesn’t necessarily reflect the views of the UNICEF.Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said at his daily briefing on Thursday that the Goodwill Ambassadors can express their opinions on anything they want to talk about but when they are speaking on UNICEF’s behalf, they will have to adhere to ‘UNICEF’s evidence-based impartial positions’.His statement read, “When UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors speak in their personal capacity, they retain the right to speak about issues that interest or concern them. Their personal views or actions do not necessarily reflect those of UNICEF. When they speak on behalf of the UNICEF, we expect them to adhere to UNICEF’s evidence-based impartial positions.”Revealing that UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors are the people who have willingly agreed to spend their time for the welfare of children by associating themselves with the organisation, the spokesperson also stressed upon the major roles of the ambassadors. He said, “The UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors are prominent individuals who have agreed to generously volunteer their time and their public profile to promote children’s rights.”The matter came into the light when a Pakistani woman asked Priyanka at an event about her tweet made in support of the Indian armed forces post the Pulwama attack on February 14 in which many CRPF troopers were martyred. The woman alleged that PC has been encouraging the idea of a nuclear war against Pakistan and holds hypocrite views as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.She said, “You are a UNICEF ambassador for peace and you’re encouraging nuclear war against Pakistan. There’s no winner in this… As a Pakistani, millions of people like me have supported you in your business of Bollywood and you wanted nuclear war.”Priyanka, who was widely praised for gracefully handling the situation, told the woman, “I have many, many friends from Pakistan and I am from India. War is not something I’m really fond of but I am patriotic, so I’m sorry if I hurt sentiments of people who do love me and have loved me. But I think that all of us have a, sort of, middle ground that we all have to walk. Just like you probably do as well. The way that you came at me right now… girl, don’t yell. We’re all here for love.”Following this, Pakistan wrote to UNICEF and its Human Rights Minister even tweeted to the organisation saying, “@UNICEF needs to remove Priyanka Chopra as its ambassador immediately in the wake of her support for Indian mly (military) and rogue Modi govt. Otherwise it makes a mockery of such appointments. UNICEF should really be more careful on whom it appoints to these honorary positions.” (sic)It should be noted that Priyanka Chopra never talked about ‘nuclear war’. The 2000 Miss World didn’t say anything beyond the tweet made in the aftermath of the car bomb attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed that killed more than 40 Central Reserve Police personnel and the Indian Air Force counterstrike on the organisation’s base in Pakistan.",https://www.india.com/showbiz/bollywood-news-unicef-on-pakistans-stand-against-priyanka-chopra-ambassadors-retain-the-right-to-speak-on-issues-that-concern-them-3753331/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

A former unnamed contractor claimed that most of the voices they heard were of children, the report added.",Engadget,"Microsoft contractors reportedly listened to Xbox owners too. Earlier this month, we learned that contractors heard audio snippets from Skype calls and Cortana interactions. Now, Vice reports that Microsoft contractors also listened to audio picked up by Xbox consoles. The device was only supposed to capture audio after voice commands, like ""Xbox"" or ""Hey Cortana,"" but contractors claim recordings were sometimes triggered accidentally.According to the contractors Motherboard spoke to, this has been going on since before Cortana arrived on the scene. Motherboard's sources said they listened to audio when Xbox could be controlled via voice commands with the Kinect system. Microsoft removed Cortana from the Xbox in July, but the voice assistant can control the console via the Cortana Android and iOS apps.Like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google -- which have all been charged with listening to voice assistant queries -- Microsoft listened in on audio in an attempt to improve products and services.

4461,"Russia sends its 1st, life-sized humanoid robot Fedor to space","The Russian space agency Roscosmos on Thursday sent an unmanned rocket carrying a life-size humanoid robot Fedor (Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research) to space. The robot is scheduled to spend 10 days learning to assist astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS). It repeated the first man to space, Yuri Gagarin's launch phrase, ""Let's go! Let's go!"" on being launched.",Times Now,"Moscow: Russia on Thursday launched an unmanned rocket carrying a life-size humanoid robot that will spend 10 days learning to assist astronauts on the International Space Station. Named Fedor, short for Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research, the robot is the first ever sent up by Russia.Fedor blasted off in a Soyuz MS-14 spacecraft at 6:38 am Moscow time (0338 GMT) from Russia's Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Soyuz is set to dock with the space station on Saturday and stay till September 7. Soyuz ships are normally manned on such trips, but on Thursday no humans are travelling in order to test a new emergency rescue system.Instead of cosmonauts, Fedor, also known as Skybot F850, was strapped into a specially adapted pilot's seat, with a small Russian flag in hand. ""Let's go. Let's go,"" the robot was heard saying during launch, repeating the famous phrase used by first man in space Yuri Gagarin.The silvery anthropomorphic robot stands 1.80 metres (5 foot 11 inches) tall and weighs 160 kilogrammes (353 pounds). Fedor has Instagram and Twitter accounts with posts saying it is learning new skills such as opening a bottle of water. In the station, it will trial those manual skills in very low gravity.""That's connecting and disconnecting electric cables (and) using standard items, from a screwdriver and a spanner to a fire extinguisher,"" the Russian space agency's director for prospective programmes and science, Alexander Bloshenko, said in televised comments ahead of the launch.""The first stage of in-flight experiments went according to the flight plan,"" the robot tweeted after reaching orbit. Fedor copies human movements, a key skill that allows it to remotely help astronauts or even people on Earth to carry out tasks while the humans are strapped into an exoskeleton.Such robots will eventually carry out dangerous operations such as space walks, Bloshenko told the state news agency RIA Novosti. On the website of one of the state backers of the project, the Foundation of Advanced Research Projects, Fedor is described as potentially useful on Earth for working in high radiation environments, demining and tricky rescue missions.Though initially developed for the emergencies ministry, Fedor can also be seen shooting at targets from two handguns in a video posted by Russian space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin.On board, the robot will perform tasks supervised by Russian cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov, who joined the ISS in July and will wear an exoskeleton and augmented reality glasses in a series of experiments later this month.Since Fedor is not trained to grab space station handles to move about in microgravity conditions, its legs will be immobilised on the space station, Bloshenko said.- Fedor not the first -Space agency chief Rogozin showed pictures of the robot to President Vladimir Putin this month, saying it will be ""an assistant to the crew"". ""In the future we plan that this machine will also help us conquer deep space,"" he added. Russian media speculated that Fedor-like robots will be used in Russia's Moon programme.Fedor is not the first robot to go into space. In 2011, NASA sent up Robonaut 2, a humanoid robot developed with General Motors that had a similar aim of working in high-risk environments.It was flown back to Earth in 2018 after experiencing technical problems. In 2013, Japan sent up a small robot called Kirobo along with the ISS's first Japanese space commander.

[USA], Aug 23 (ANI): US President Donald Trump plans to hold discussions on Kashmir and human rights with Prime Minister Narendra Modi this weekend at the G7 summit in Biarritz.A senior administration official who briefed reporters on Trump’s agenda for the upcoming summit on Saturday said the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan are expected to come up.""President Trump will likely want to hear from Prime Minister Modi on how he plans to reduce regional tensions and uphold respect for human rights in Kashmir,"" the official said.After a brief conversation with Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday, the US President once again offered his proposal to mediate on Kashmir, despite making it clear before that the ongoing dispute in the region should be resolved bilaterally by India and Pakistan.Ramping up rhetoric against India, Pakistan is endlessly trying to involve the international community in the wake of New Delhi's historic decision to change the constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir. This move comes despite the latter's, time and again, reiteration that the matter is strictly ""internal"" to the country.Following the initial quashing of his plans on mediation by New Delhi, Trump had reaffirmed his position that Kashmir remains a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan.However, adhering to Khan's request on Tuesday, the US President changed his stance and offered to mediate on the issue once again.Calling Kashmir a ""complicated situation"", Trump said, ""A lot has to do with religion. You have the Hindus, and you have the Muslims.

4475,SEBI permits credit rating agencies to collect clients' debt info,"SEBI on Wednesday allowed credit rating agencies to obtain details of clients' existing and future debt. The move aims at enabling rating agencies to have timely information on the default of an entity. Rating agencies have come under scanner after numerous loan defaults, including IL&FS case, but they often cite lack of information as a reason for their delayed response.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s markets regulator on Wednesday allowed credit rating agencies to obtain details of clients’ existing and future debt, in a bid to help them identify defaults in a timely way, amid a severe credit crunch and a slowdown in the economy.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said it enabled rating agencies to get “explicit consent” from clients in rating agreements to secure details on debt repayments and any delays or defaults from lenders or other organisations. SEBI has cracked down on such agencies in the past few years, following a series of sudden downgrades and withdrawals of ratings and for failing to identify potential defaults in time.  But rating agencies have often cited the lack of information shared by companies as a reason for their delayed response.  The regulator has also been tightening disclosure regulations to boost transparency, monitoring and accountability of rating agencies. The collapse of shadow bank Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) late last year led to a series of defaults by several non-bank finance companies and dented credit growth, bringing a broader slowdown in the economy. Last month, audit firm Grant Thornton said in a report that  rating agencies for years assigned high ratings to IL&FS and its group companies despite its deteriorating finances. SEBI on Wednesday also eased several regulations for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). These include simplifying registration procedures and eligibility criteria, amid a pullout by these investors after controversial tax measures introduced by the government in this year’s budget. The regulator also allowed mutual funds to invest up to 10% of their total debt portfolio in unlisted non-convertible debentures (NCDs) only if the instruments are rated and secured, months after saying it would limit mutual funds to listed NCDs. In June, SEBI had tightened regulations for mutual funds to ensure adequate liquidity in certain schemes and to limit their exposure to housing finance companies.

4488,S Korea to end intelligence sharing pact with Japan amid tensions,"South Korea will end an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan amid the rising tensions between the two countries. Under the pact, South Korea and Japan shared information on North Korea's missile and nuclear activities. Relations between South Korea and Japan have become strained over trade and historical issues related to Japan's colonisation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.",Reuters,"SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korea said on Thursday it will scrap an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, drawing a swift protest from Tokyo and deepening a decades-old dispute over history that has hit trade and undercut security cooperation over North Korea. Seoul’s decision not to extend the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) shows how the political and trade dispute between the Asian neighbours and U.S. allies has hit some of the region’s most sensitive security issues. The agreement had been due for automatic renewal on Saturday. The arrangement was designed to share information on the threat posed by North Korea and its missile and nuclear activities - a threat underlined by the North’s recent launch of a series of short-range ballistic missiles. South Korea’s Kim You-geun, a deputy director of the presidential National Security Council, said Japan had created a “grave change” in the environment for bilateral security cooperation by removing South Korea’s fast-track export status this month. “Under this situation, we have determined that it would not serve our national interest to maintain an agreement we signed with the aim of exchanging military information which is sensitive to security,” Kim told a news conference. Relations between South Korea and Japan began to deteriorate late last year following a diplomatic row over compensation for wartime forced labourers during Japan’s occupation of Korea. They soured further when Japan tightened its curbs on exports of high-tech materials needed by South Korea’s chip industry, and again this month when Tokyo said it would remove South Korea’s fast-track export status. The United States, which fears weakened security cooperation in the region, expressed dismay. “We’re disappointed to see the decision the South Koreans made about that information-sharing agreement. We’re urging each of the two countries to continue to engage,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Ottawa, Canada. “There is no doubt that the shared interests of Japan and South Korea are important and they’re important to the United States of America,” he added, saying he had spoken to South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha earlier on Thursday. Japan’s foreign minister, Taro Kono, criticized Seoul for what he said was mixing the export controls with security issues. “Given such issues as North Korea, everyone probably understands the importance of this agreement. But this decision was made while linking it to Japan’s review of export controls,” he told reporters. “I cannot help saying they are completely misreading the security environment.” He said Tokyo had summoned the South Korean ambassador in protest. South Korea's won currency KRW= extended losses against the dollar in offshore non-deliverable forward trade. South Korea’s Kang emphasized the decision to end the pact was because South Korea had lost trust in Japan. “We will continue to strengthen cooperation with the United States and develop the alliance,” she told reporters in Seoul. South Korea’s Defence Ministry said that regardless of the end of GSOMIA, it would maintain a “stable” joint defence posture based on a robust alliance with the United States. Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Dave Eastburn said the integrity of U.S. mutual defence and security ties needed to be maintained despite frictions in other areas of the relationship between Japan and South Korea. “The Department of Defense expresses our strong concern and disappointment that the Moon administration has withheld its renewal of ... GSOMIA,” he said, referring to South Korean President Moon Jae-in. One Western military source said the intelligence-sharing was sometimes limited but nevertheless an important area of cooperation in the face of threats from North Korea. GSOMIA facilitated the sharing of information on North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats, which remain despite a series of summits and negotiations with North Korea, said Cho Tae-yong, a former South Korean national security adviser who worked on the deal when it was first signed. “Ending GSOMIA is not only the wrong card to play to press Japan, but it is just not helpful for our security,” he said. Analysts in the United States also saw the move as misguided and some blamed an inward-looking Trump administration for failing to pay sufficient attention to U.S. allies. “This is what America First gets us - everyone for themselves in lieu of a collaborative network of partners,” Daniel Russel, the State Department’s top diplomat for Asia until early in the Trump administration, told the Nelson Report online newsletter.  “At a time when North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals are rapidly expanding, the abrogation of GSOMIA directly harms U.S. national security,” he said. “And at a time when China’s assertiveness and new capabilities represent an unprecedented challenge, the disintegration of the U.S.-led alliance system is a disaster.” China and also Russia have become more assertive in the region, flying their first joint military air patrol together in July, which triggered an international incident with South Korea and Japan. Before the signing of the agreement in 2016, under U.S. pressure, South Korea and Japan shared intelligence through the United States. South Korea went ahead with the deal at the time despite opposition from some political parties and a large section of the public, who remain bitter over Japan’s actions during its colonial rule of Korea from 1910 until the end of World War Two. A 2012 attempt to seal the deal fell apart in the face of opposition in South Korea toward military cooperation with Japan. South Korea had warned it could reconsider the GSOMIA after Japan imposed export curbs and then stripped South Korea of its favoured trading partner status. Seoul said those moves by Japan were in retaliation for a South Korean Supreme Court order for Japanese companies to compensate some of their wartime forced labourers last October. Japan condemned that ruling, saying the matter was resolved by a 1965 treaty normalizing ties. It has also cited unspecified security reasons for its export controls.

The report said VW could profit from Tesla's competence in fields of batteries and software.",Reuters,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said on Thursday it was not interested in taking a stake in Tesla (TSLA.O), denying a media report that CEO Herbert Diess wanted to buy shares in the U.S. company to access its software and batteries technology. “The speculation about buying a stake in Tesla made by Manager Magazin is without merit,” a Volkswagen spokesman said in a written statement to Reuters. Manager Magazin had said Diess meets with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on a regular basis because of the U.S. carmaker’s expertise in software and battery cell design, and that Tesla had so far rebuffed Volkswagen’s efforts at striking an alliance. “Diess would go in right away if he could,” the magazine quoted an unidentified top Volkswagen manager as saying. Acquiring a stake would be enough for the German carmaker to access Tesla’s technological expertise, the report said. An obstacle, however, would be to get the consent of Volkswagen’s controlling Piech and Porsche families to fund the stake purchase, the magazine added. A banker close to Volkswagen said that while Diess would love to have Tesla’s software developers, the CEO believed it was almost impossible to justify paying $30 billion (27 billion euros) to buy the whole company. Tesla’s shares pared pre-market gains following Volkswagen’s denial of the magazine report. At 1335 GMT, they were up 1.3% at $223.60, while Volkswagen’s shares were up 1.2% at 144.36 euros.

4499,Too late for a new Brexit deal: Macron tells Johnson,French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday told UK PM Boris Johnson that there was not enough time left to rewrite Brexit divorce deal before October 31 deadline. Johnson has warned of a disorderly no-deal Brexit unless the EU does a new deal. The EU and the UK are yet to resolve whether Ireland will have a hard border after Brexit.,Reuters,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron told Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday that there was not enough time to wholly rewrite Britain’s Brexit divorce deal before an Oct. 31 deadline. Johnson met Macron at the Elysee Palace a day after talks in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who challenged Britain to come up with acceptable alternatives to the agreed safety net provision for the UK-Irish land border. More than three years after the United Kingdom voted to quit the European Union, it is still unclear on what terms - or indeed whether - the bloc’s second largest economy will leave the club it joined in 1973. Talks over lunch were constructive, a French official said. Macron left the door open to Britain seeking a solution to the Irish “backstop”, but said any alternative must respect both the integrity of the EU single market and stability on the divided island of Ireland. “I want to be very clear,” he said. “In the month ahead, we will not find a new withdrawal agreement that deviates far from the original.” On his first trip abroad since entering 10 Downing Street a month ago, Johnson has warned Merkel and Macron that they face a potentially disorderly no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 unless the EU does a new deal. Speaking in The Hague, Merkel said she had not meant to set a deadline when saying on Wednesday that a solution to the Irish border issue could be found within 30 days, but to “highlight the urgency”. The British pound, sensitive to the prospect of a 'no-deal' exit, rose 1% against both the dollar GBP=D3 and the euro GBPEUR= on her comments. [GBP/] Johnson told Macron that he believed it was possible to agree a deal before Oct. 31, and that he had been “powerfully encouraged” by what he had heard from Merkel on Wednesday. “Let’s get Brexit done, let’s get it done sensibly and pragmatically and in the interests of both sides and let’s not wait until October 31,” Johnson said. “Let’s get on now in deepening and intensifying the friendship and partnership between us.” Johnson, an ardent Brexiteer, is betting that the threat of ‘no-deal’ Brexit turmoil will convince Merkel and Macron that the EU should do a last-minute deal to suit his demands. He has repeated promises to leave on Oct. 31 - with or without a deal. Macron insisted Britain’s destiny lay in Johnson’s hands alone. He said the EU did not want a ‘no-deal’ scenario, but would be ready if it happened.  The political crisis in London over Brexit has left allies and investors puzzled by a country that for decades seemed a confident pillar of Western economic and political stability. Many investors say a ‘no-deal’ Brexit would hurt the economies of Britain, the EU and the wider world, roil financial markets and weaken London’s position as the pre-eminent international financial centre. Macron said that any new solution to the problem of the Irish border had to be found in the next month. Signalling that the ball was in the UK’s court, he said: “If we cannot find alternatives, then it will be because of a deeper problem, a political one, a British political problem. “And for that, negotiations can’t help. It will be up to the prime minister to make that choice, it won’t be up to us.” After Brexit, the frontier between Ireland and the UK province of Northern Ireland will be the only land border between the EU’s single market and Britain. The EU wants to ensure that it does not become a back door for goods to enter the single market - which guarantees free movement of goods, capital, services and labour. Ireland for its part says physical checks could undermine the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland after more than 3,600 died in a three-decade conflict between unionists who wanted the province to remain British and Irish nationalists who want it to join a united Ireland ruled from Dublin.     The backstop, negotiated by Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May, provides for Britain to remain in a temporary customs union with the EU after Brexit, avoiding the need for any ‘hard’ border infrastructure, until a better solution is found.  But Johnson said in Paris: “Under no circumstances will the UK government be instituting, imposing, checks or controls of any kind at that border. We think there are ways of protecting the integrity of the single market and allowing the UK to exit from the EU.” Brexit supporters acknowledge that there may be short-term disruption from a ‘no-deal’ exit but say the UK will thrive if cut free from what they cast as a doomed experiment in integration that has led Europe to fall behind China and the United States.

4500,Iran unveils domestically developed missile defence system,Iran on Thursday unveiled its domestically developed surface-to-air missile air defence system and claimed it can shoot down targets at a distance of 200 km. The mobile Bavar-373 system was unveiled by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on IranÂ’s National Defence Industry Day. Iranian media has claimed that mobile Bavar-373 system is a competitor to the Russian S-300 missile system.,Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran displayed what it described as a domestically built long-range, surface-to-air missile air defense system on Thursday, at a time of rising tension with the United States.  Iran shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone in the Gulf with a surface-to-air missile in June. It says the drone was over its territory, but the United States says it was in international airspace. State television showed President Hassan Rouhani attending an unveiling ceremony for the mobile Bavar-373 system, which Iranian media have described as a competitor to the Russian S-300 missile system. “With this long-range air defense system, we can detect ... targets or planes at more than 300 km (190 miles), lock it at about 250 km, and destroy it at 200 km,” Defence Minister Amir Hatami told state television. The system’s unveiling came on Iran’s National Defence Industry Day. Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of international sanctions and embargoes that have barred it from importing many weapons.  Western military analysts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities, though concerns about its long-range ballistic missile program contributed to Washington last year leaving the pact that Iran sealed with world powers in 2015 to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions. On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned at a U.N. Security Council meeting that, under the Iran nuclear deal, a United Nations arms embargo on Iran was due to expire in October 2020.

4503,Google breaks 10-year tradition of naming Android versions on sweets,"Google has revealed the official name of the upcoming Android version as 'Android 10', breaking a 10-year tradition of naming the versions after sweets and desserts. Google had begun the tradition with the Android 1.5 update, which was codenamed 'Cupcake'. Google said it received feedback over the years that the names weren't always understood by everyone in the global community.",Engadget,"Google has finally revealed Android Q's release name, and it's not Quiche, Quinoa or Quesadilla. In fact, it's not named after any dessert that starts with the letter Q at all -- the tech giant has decided to simply call it Android 10. In a blog post, the company said it's changing the way it names its releases altogether in a push for greater accessibility. ""[W]e've heard feedback over the years that the names weren't always understood by everyone in the global community,"" the company wrote.Since L and R aren't always distinguishable when spoken in some languages, for instance, it's not immediately obvious for some people that Android Lollipop came after KitKat. The names of some previous Android versions aren't known desserts in certain parts of the world either. In other words, while the names are fun, they don't always resonate with users. The new scheme sounds much less quirky and delicious, but it'll likely serve Google's purpose: come up with more relatable and intuitive names. ""[W]e think that at version 10 and 2.5 billion active devices,"" the blog post reads, ""it was time to make this change.""In addition to changing the way it names Android versions, Google has also updated the mobile platform's logo. It changed the text from green to black to make it easier to read, switched fonts and used a close-up of the Android robot that's now colored in a new shade of green.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/22/android-q-becomes-android-10/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4504,Changes in Zomato's 'Gold' service a knee-jerk reaction: NRAI,"National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) called Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal's decision to make changes in the 'Gold' service a ""knee-jerk reaction"" to the #Logout movement. Annual Gold subscription cost will be hiked by 50% and changes including one unlock per day, per user will be implemented, Goyal told restaurants. ""It's a tweak in the drug...doesn't solve addiction,"" NRAI said.",Entrackr,"After facing continuous backlash from restaurant partners over deep discounting by restaurant table reservation platforms, Zomato has taken a series of measures to stop misuse of Zomato Gold subscription. The company is limiting Gold usage by a single user to one unlock per day with restriction to a max of two per table.Zomato also hiked the annual Gold subscription cost by 50%. So far, it was selling a premium subscription at Rs 1,199. Now, it costs Rs 1,800. The firm already had reflected new pricing for Gold subscription on its website.Zomato will restrict a user’s Gold login ID to a single mobile device at a time so that login sharing becomes impossible. Introduction of features to block sharing of unlocking screens over Whatsapp is also on the card.According to a detailed document sent to restaurant partners and representing bodies including the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), the firm is also discontinuing the trial packs for Gold that it recently launched.Entrackr has a copy of the proposal sent by Zomato to NRAI.Responding to changes made in Gold subscription, NRAI stated that this is a knee jerk reaction to the #logout movement and the meeting held between the founding team of Zomato and Management committee members of NRAI.“It’s a validation of the fact that Zomato acknowledges the deep discounting epidemic. However, the ‘reconstruct of gold’ is another attempt to stuff old wine in a new bottle. It’s a tweak in the drug, which doesn’t solve the addiction. We stand united in the cause to obliviate the deep discounting phenomenon, and will therefore #stayloggedout,” mentioned the statement.According to Zomato proposal, Gold restaurants that have a minimum of 1,000 Gold unlock per quarter per outlet with an average cumulative rating of 4.5+ for Gold visits during that quarter, will get ads credit worth Rs 25,000 per outlet per quarter from Zomato to promote their brand and drive non-discounted business.Zomato would invest in the brand of Gold partners who have a minimum of 600 subscriptions unlocks per quarter. Boycotting the Gold subscription several thousand restaurants had logged out from Gold partnership. According to a TOI report, about 450 restaurants walked out from contract in Pune alone.Looking at NRAI stance, it’s clear that Zomato has failed to contain boycott from restaurant partners through revising the Gold plan. The company is likely to tweak the membership with more favours in restaurant partners.Meanwhile, more favours for restaurants essentially mean less lucrative for consumers. Indeed, Zomato is locked in a tight battle with partners. It would be interesting to see how the company responds to the NRAI call.",https://entrackr.com/2019/08/zomato-rejigs-gold-membership-nrai-boycott-continue/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4505,Amazon's largest campus in Hyderabad got govt clearances in 11 days,"Clearances for Amazon's largest campus in Hyderabad were given by the government in only 11 days, Telangana Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said. This was possible with the Telangana State Industrial Project and Self-Certification System (TS-iPASS). Ranjan added that clearance for Amazon's complicated building structure would have taken at least one year without TS-iPASS.",The News Minute,"Global e-commerce giant Amazon opened the world’s largest campus building in Hyderabad on Wednesday. While it was built in a record time of three years, Telangana Principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan revealed at the launch that the approval for Amazon to set up such a massive facility in the heart of the city was given by the government in just 11 days. And this was done with the help of TS-iPASS.Telangana State Industrial Project and Self-Certification System (TS-iPASS) is a self-certification service by the state that allows companies to obtain speedy approvals to do business with the state through a single window within a stipulated timeline.“Amazon has a very complicated building structure. It has interconnected corridors, multiple parking spaces and having had experiences of working with the Urban development authority, the company would have required at least a year to obtain permission (to do business with the state). But because of TS-iPASS, Amazon obtained its certification in a record number of 11 days,” he said.Speaking to TNM, Jayesh Ranjan said that until a few years ago, from junior officers to senior engineers, the process of approval prior to the introduction of TS-iPASS took several months for certification.“Officers would point out trivial issues like using red ink over blue ink to using the photocopy of a certificate instead of its original. There used to be extortion and people would deal the issue with vested interests. However, with the help of TS-iPASS, the process is now transaparent and much simplified,” he said.According to Jayesh, the new system now generates a date when the officials have to mandatorily visit and inspect the sites. In case of major glitches, the software allows a time period of three days for the officials to raise a query and that’s the only time frame when the officers can ask questions. Most of the documents can be now submitted online instead of carrying papers in big suitcases to offices.“For companies like IKEA and Amazon, some exemptions are made in the case of bye-laws, to ensure that the construction of the company’s modern infrastructure is not hindered because the laws we follow in the state are still archaic,” he added, reiterating that the exemptions don’t mean that any of the safety measures are compromised or overlooked.Jayesh Ranjan also said that he placed three requests in front of the e-commerce giant at improving the technological landscape of Hyderabad and Telangana. The official said the state is looking forward for Amazon to provide opportunities to the textile industry and weavers in the state by providing them marketing support through Amazon’s global platform.He also added that Amazon, which has mastered machine learning through virtual assistants like Alexa, can play a major role in altering the AI (Artificial Intelligence) landscape of the city. He invited the company to be a major partner of the state’s Centre for Excellence and also urged Amazon to actively engage in more CSR activities by partnering with the Telangana social impact group.With 1.8 million square feet office space built over 3 million square ft area, the newly opened state-of-the-art campus can house over 15,000 employees. This is Amazon's single largest building in the world in terms of area. Amazon laid the foundation stone for the campus building in March 2016. An average of 2,000 workers every day finished building the facility in three years, spending 18 million man-hours.With the coming of the new building, Hyderabad is now home to one-third of Amazon employees in India and will have the largest IT employee base outside the US.  With inputs from Shilpa S Ranipeta Read: Amazon unveils its largest campus in the world in Hyderabad, to house 15,000 employeesIs rampant pharma pollution in Telangana a policy issue?

Reports say police had resorted to ""mild lathi charge"" and tear gas to disperse the crowd.Azad was supposed to be produced before Delhi’s Saket court on Thursday, but the authorities were reportedly wary that there might be commotion at the court complex. Hence, a decision was taken to conduct the hearing at the police station, where the party was presented before a judge and court proceedings were held.At the Kalkaji police station, the judge listened to each of the 96 people who were arrested on an individual basis — a process which took almost four hours to complete.

4527,Banks publish newspaper ads calling for peace in Hong Kong,"Hong Kong's biggest banks on Wednesday published full-page advertisements in newspapers calling for peaceful resolutions after more than two months of political unrest. HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of East Asia, which published the ads, urged the restoration of social order. Protests against an extradition bill have evolved into a pro-democracy movement, concerned about China's growing power in Hong Kong.",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong banks published full-page newspaper ads calling for law and order in the Chinese-ruled city and international jewelers sought the rescheduling of a huge trade fair as weeks of pro-democracy protests showed no sign of let-up on Thursday. Thousands held a scrappy anti-government protest on Wednesday at a suburban subway station where demonstrators were attacked by a mob of white-shirted men last month. Protesters at the subway station were angry that nobody had yet been prosecuted for that violence. Police said they charged two men with rioting in connection with the July attack, who are to appear in court on Friday. Wednesday’s standoff stopped short of recent intense clashes, including the storming of the legislature and occupation of the airport, with police refraining from using tear gas or attempting to storm protesters’ lines. Police said they arrested two men for unlawful assembly. HSBC (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and Bank of East Asia (0023.HK) all urged the restoration of order in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. “Oppose violence, restore social order, safeguard Hong Kong’s status as an international financial center,” Standard Chartered said in its advertisement. Trade representatives of the world’s largest diamond trading centers, from Antwerp, Mumbai and Ramat Gan, asked the organizer of the high-profile Hong Kong Jewellery and Gem Fair to postpone the event, which typically draws more than 54,000 visitors. In a letter, they told organizer Informa Markets that between 30% and 40% of exhibitors were demanding to pull out of the fair, due to be held in September at the Asia World Exposition center and the Wan Chai Convention and Exhibition center. “In light of recent events, we urge Informa Markets to consider the following; rather than potentially risking an empty show in terms of both visitors and exhibitors, postpone the show to a later date - as yet to be determined - once Hong Kong is in a more stable climate,” the representatives wrote. “Additionally, we request financial compensation in the form of a discount or refund for all participating companies.” Protests erupted in Hong Kong in June over a now-suspended bill that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial but have since grown into one of the biggest populist challenges faced by Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012. The unrest has been fueled by broader worries about the erosion of freedoms guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” formula adopted after 1997 but not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary and the right to protest. Several anti-government demonstrations are planned, including a rally by hundreds of high school students on Thursday and a “stress test” of the airport at the weekend. The protests are already exacting a toll on Hong Kong’s economy and tourism, with the financial hub on the verge of its first recession in a decade. The Hong Kong Retail Management Association, which represents more than 8,000 businesses, urged all landlords to halve rents for six months. “If the situation continues, it is expected that many retailers may have to sack staff or even shut down,” it said in a statement.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam reiterated on Tuesday that the extradition legislation was dead but has stopped short of officially withdrawing the bill, as protesters have demanded. Demonstrators are also calling for an independent inquiry into the protests and perceived police brutality, a halt to descriptions of the protests as “rioting”, the waiver of charges against those arrested, and resumption of political reform. Beijing has reacted sharply to the protests and accused foreign countries, including the United States, of fomenting unrest. China has also sent a clear warning that forceful intervention is possible, with paramilitary forces holding drills in neighboring Shenzhen. An employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong has been detained in China for involvement in prostitution, the state-backed Global Times newspaper said. China’s foreign ministry confirmed that the employee, Simon Cheng, was detained in Shenzhen. Britain has expressed its extreme concern about the case. U.S. President Donald Trump over the weekend warned against a crackdown in Hong Kong like Beijing’s suppression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, which would make reaching a deal he has been seeking to end a trade war with China “very hard”.

4530,Reducing e-commerce restrictions will revive Indian economy: Amazon,"Amazon's India head Amit Agarwal on Wednesday said that India needs to encourage e-commerce and reduce red tape to help revive domestic economic growth. ""Even a seller, who wants to sell out of their state, has to get a tax registration in the new state,"" he said. Agarwal added that there is ""so much opportunity to just let e-commerce thrive"".",Reuters,"HYDERABAD (Reuters) - India needs to encourage ecommerce and reduce red tape to help small businesses sell online and export goods to help revive sagging domestic economic growth, a senior Amazon.com executive said on Wednesday. “There is so much opportunity to just let ecommerce thrive versus trying to define every single guard rail under which it should operate,” Amazon’s India head Amit Agarwal told Reuters, ahead of the launch of Amazon’s biggest campus in the world in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, on Wednesday. India revised its ecommerce rules in early 2019, creating hurdles for Amazon and rival Walmart Inc’s ecommerce subsidiary, Flipkart.    “I feel ecommerce can actually accelerate India’s economy in a big way, if it’s just allowed to thrive,” said Agarwal, whose comments come at a time when India’s economic growth has slumped to near five-year lows. Agarwal said Amazon works with some 500,000 sellers, and has created over 200,000 jobs in India since launching its ecommerce operations in 2013. He said Amazon’s push to get small and medium businesses in India to export has resulted in more than $1 billion in exports and it expects this to exceed $5 billion in the next three years, but red tape is holding some businesses back. “Even a seller, who wants to sell out of their state, has to get a tax registration in the new state. How many small business owners would go through the onerous job of doing that?” he said.  “The number of basic paper cut opportunities out there are so many,” he said. “I feel we’re getting lost in the high level debate around ecommerce and data localization.”    India’s revised ecommerce regulations, along with its push to compel multinationals to store data locally, have irked the U.S. government and heightened trade tensions between the two countries. India has argued the rules are aimed at protecting interests of its small traders and also its citizens’ privacy. Amazon’s launch of a new campus in India comes just months after the Seattle-based company scrapped its plans to build a major outpost in New York, blaming opposition from local leaders. It has since picked Arlington, Virginia as the site of its upcoming second headquarters. India is considered the last major growth market for the e-commerce giant and founder Jeff Bezos has committed investments of more than $5 billion toward Amazon’s expansion in India. Amazon said the new campus in India, spread over 9.5 acres, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and could house more than 15,000 employees. Amazon has 62,000 employees in India, roughly a third of whom are based in Hyderabad. Despite weaker economic conditions Amazon has no plans to slow down its expansion in India, said Agarwal, adding that in tougher times “customers want even more value, convenience and selection.” While declining to give any specific numbers, Agarwal said membership in Amazon’s Prime loyalty program has doubled in the last 18 months in India and the market remains Amazon’s fastest growing for Prime worldwide.

4531,Electronic lens more capable than human eye made: Harvard team,"A team of Harvard researchers has created an electronic lens that works like the human eye. However, the lens comprises additional capabilities including simultaneous focus, control of aberrations caused by astigmatisms and image shifts. ""This demonstrates the feasibility of embedded optical zoom and autofocus for a wide range of applications, including cell phone cameras,"" the team said.",Engadget,"A new breakthrough could soon revolutionize the design of almost every optical instrument in use today, including cameras, eyeglasses and telescopes. Combining recent developments in artificial muscle and flat lens technologies, a team of researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have created a new lens that functions a lot like the human eye. Not only is the instrument capable of focusing in real-time thanks to an elastomer muscle, it features none of the bulk of a traditional spherical lens. It can even do some things the human eye can't, including adjusting for astigmatism and image shift, two variables that lead to blurry vision.All of this is thanks to an earlier technology a team of some of the same researchers developed. The flat lens design this new artificial eye takes advantage of is called a metalens. It uses tiny nanostructures to focus light. In this way, it's able to focus the entire visible light spectrum at a single point. By contrast, traditional lenses use multiple elements to achieve the same feat, which is why they get so bulky.Prior to this latest breakthrough, the SEAS team says they were only able to manufacture metalenses that were ""the size of a piece of glitter."" By contrast, their latest invention is larger at approximately one centimeter in diameter Bigger, in this case, is better because it makes it more feasible to use the technology in a host of modern applications. With cameras, for instance, a lens needs to be big enough to cover a sensor so that there's no vignetting.As with any new technology, it'll likely be years before metalenses make their way to consumer gadgets. However, their potential is unmistakable. Combined with even smaller computer chips, something like virtual and augmented reality headsets could become small and comfortable enough where the technology becomes appealing to the average consumer.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/21/harvard-metalens-better-than-human-eye/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

World powers know that unilateral pressure against Iran can't be to their advantage, he added. This comes after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif said the country might act ""unpredictably"" in response to ""unpredictable"" US policies.",Reuters,"GENEVA (Reuters) - If Iran’s oil exports are cut to zero, international waterways will not have the same security as before, its president said on Wednesday, cautioning Washington against raising pressure on Tehran in an angry confrontation between the longtime foes. The comment by President Hassan Rouhani coincided with a remark by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif that Tehran might act “unpredictably” in response to “unpredictable” U.S. policies under President Donald Trump. “World powers know that in the case that oil is completely sanctioned and Iran’s oil exports are brought down to zero, international waterways can’t have the same security as before,” Rouhani said while meeting Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to Khamenei’s official website. “So unilateral pressure against Iran can’t be to their advantage and won’t guarantee their security in the region and the world.” Tensions between Tehran and Washington have risen since the Trump administration last year quit an international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions and began to ratchet up sanctions. Tehran has denounced the new penalties as “economic warfare”. In a speech at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Zarif appeared to echo Rouhani’s tone. “Mutual unpredictability will lead to chaos. President Trump cannot expect to be unpredictable and expect others to be predictable. Unpredictability will lead to mutual unpredictability and unpredictability is chaotic,” Zarif said. Global commodity trading has been rocked in recent months after a series of attacks on international merchant vessels, which the United States has blamed on Iran, and an Iranian seizure of a British oil tanker. Tehran has denied accusations that it was behind attacks on six tankers in May and June. Washington, which has by far the strongest Western naval contingent in the Gulf, has been calling for its allies to join it in an operation to guard shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital gateway for the world’s oil industry. So far, Britain, Australia and Bahrain have joined the U.S.-led security mission to protect merchant vessels traveling through key Middle East waterways. Reiterating Iran’s chilly response to the security mission, Iranian Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi, a deputy commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, said no one can secure the Gulf other than Iran and countries of the region, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. “Securing the Persian Gulf is the responsibility of Iran and the countries of the region,” Fadavi said. “Other than us, no one can secure the Persian Gulf.” Erik Hanell, owner of the British-flagged tanker detained by Iran while entering the Gulf, met Zarif in Stockholm on Aug. 20 to make the case for the ship and its crew to be freed. The Stena Impero was diverted to an Iranian port on July 19, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar. That ship was released this week. “A constructive dialogue was had and we shared information around the case,” Hanell, chief executive of Stena Bulk, said in a statement on Wednesday. “It was important for us to emphasize the importance of the release of the 23 crew...Also for the release of the Swedish-owned vessel Stena Impero.” Reporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh with additional reporting by Simon Johnson in Stockholm, Tuqa Khalid in Dubai and Kate Holton in London; Editing by William Maclean/Mark Heinrich",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-iran/iran-says-top-waterways-wont-be-as-safe-if-its-oil-exports-cut-to-zero-idUSKCN1VB1EM?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Crude oil imports into the world’s third-largest consumer declined 1.2% from a year earlier to 19.34 million tonnes, but increased 14.6% from the previous month.  Petrol imports rose to 230,000 tonnes in July, the highest since PPAC data going back to 2011.

LNG imports, meanwhile, fell to their lowest since February 2018 at 850,000 tonnes.  India’s imports of crude oil have stalled in recent months, with both coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) also soft.

Convict Nalini had sought for an extension of her ongoing parole by 30 days.Despite her ‘sincere efforts’, Nalini could not complete the arrangements for the marriage of her daughter within the given leave period, stated her current petition. Seeking response from the Tamil Nadu government regarding the extension plea, a bench comprising Justices M M Sundresh and M Nirmal Kumar had posted a further hearing on Nalini’s petition by Nalini on Thursday.Last Tuesday, Nalini had moved the court after the deputy inspector general of prisons rejected her plea for extension of the leave for another 30 days starting from Sunday.  “Nalini has petitioned the Home Secretary to extend her leave by a month in connection with preparations for her daughter’s wedding,” her legal adviser P Pugazhenthi had said.On July 25, Nalini was released from the Vellore Prison on month-long ordinary parole after she argued in person at the Madras High Court to grant her the leave. Since her release, Nalini has been residing at Sathuvachari of Vellore district. Initially, Nalini had sought a six-month leave to make arrangements for her daughter’s marriage. She had sent the petition to the government on August 7 through speed post, noted Pugazhenthi. In her plea, Nalini noted that every life convict was entitled to one month of ordinary leave after completing two years in prison and she had not taken any leaves during her past 27 years in jail.During the hearing of Nalini’s plea, Public Prosecutor A Natarajan had submitted in the court that as per the Tamil Nadu Suspension of Sentence Rules 1982, a convict is subject to receive a maximum period of 30 days as ordinary leave (parole) at a point of time. Thus, he asked the court to consider granting leave for convict Nalini within the maximum limit.The court order said that the extension of 30 days’ leave can be exercised as per Rule 22 but only after the initial grant. Further, the court ruled that Nalini must neither give any interviews nor meet any political person or member of any organisation while out on parole. Since Nalini is out on parole, a recording of her undertaking to this effect has been taken.About Rajiv Gandhi Assassination Case:Besides Nalini, the other six life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case are V Sriharan alias Murugan, husband of Nalini, AG Perarivalan, T Suthendraraja alias Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, and Ravichandran.

Tata Steel Europe was to offload about $2.4 billion debt to the combined entity.",Reuters,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp on Thursday said it was filing a complaint with a European court to dispute an antitrust decision that blocks a planned joint venture with Tata Steel. The complaint to the General Court of the European Union - seen as a symbolic move - comes after the Commission in June vetoed plans to create Europe’s second-biggest steelmaker, fearing it would overly hurt competition. The Commission was most concerned about the two companies’ combined position in the area of automotive and packaging steel, resulting in a remedy proposal Thyssenkrupp said would have been sufficient. Brussels disagreed. “In its competitive assessment of the product groups of packaging steel and hot-dip galvanized steel for the automotive industry, the Commission has for the first time set out a restrictive market definition that unduly extends the scope of the existing competition law,” Thyssenkrupp said in a statement. It was already clear in early May that Brussels would block the deal, causing a strategic U-turn at the group which includes a planned stock market listing or sale of its elevators division. Thyssenkrupp’s steel division - Steel Europe - is now expected to remain part of the group in the long-term, Thyssenkrupp has said, though it has not ruled out partnerships or the sale of a minority stake.

4585,9.5-acre Hyd campus cost 'hundreds of millions of dollars': Amazon,"Amazon on Wednesday said that its biggest campus globally in Hyderabad, spread over 9.5 acres, cost ""hundreds of millions of dollars"". Around a third of Amazon's 62,000 employees in India are based in Hyderabad. ""The investment to create an office of this size indicates that we are going to continue to grow,"" said Amit Agarwal, Amazon country's manager for India.",Reuters,"HYDERABAD (Reuters) - India needs to encourage ecommerce and reduce red tape to help small businesses sell online and export goods to help revive sagging domestic economic growth, a senior Amazon.com executive said on Wednesday. “There is so much opportunity to just let ecommerce thrive versus trying to define every single guard rail under which it should operate,” Amazon’s India head Amit Agarwal told Reuters, ahead of the launch of Amazon’s biggest campus in the world in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, on Wednesday. India revised its ecommerce rules in early 2019, creating hurdles for Amazon and rival Walmart Inc’s ecommerce subsidiary, Flipkart.    “I feel ecommerce can actually accelerate India’s economy in a big way, if it’s just allowed to thrive,” said Agarwal, whose comments come at a time when India’s economic growth has slumped to near five-year lows. Agarwal said Amazon works with some 500,000 sellers, and has created over 200,000 jobs in India since launching its ecommerce operations in 2013. He said Amazon’s push to get small and medium businesses in India to export has resulted in more than $1 billion in exports and it expects this to exceed $5 billion in the next three years, but red tape is holding some businesses back. “Even a seller, who wants to sell out of their state, has to get a tax registration in the new state. How many small business owners would go through the onerous job of doing that?” he said.  “The number of basic paper cut opportunities out there are so many,” he said. “I feel we’re getting lost in the high level debate around ecommerce and data localization.”    India’s revised ecommerce regulations, along with its push to compel multinationals to store data locally, have irked the U.S. government and heightened trade tensions between the two countries. India has argued the rules are aimed at protecting interests of its small traders and also its citizens’ privacy. Amazon’s launch of a new campus in India comes just months after the Seattle-based company scrapped its plans to build a major outpost in New York, blaming opposition from local leaders. It has since picked Arlington, Virginia as the site of its upcoming second headquarters. India is considered the last major growth market for the e-commerce giant and founder Jeff Bezos has committed investments of more than $5 billion toward Amazon’s expansion in India. Amazon said the new campus in India, spread over 9.5 acres, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and could house more than 15,000 employees. Amazon has 62,000 employees in India, roughly a third of whom are based in Hyderabad. Despite weaker economic conditions Amazon has no plans to slow down its expansion in India, said Agarwal, adding that in tougher times “customers want even more value, convenience and selection.” While declining to give any specific numbers, Agarwal said membership in Amazon’s Prime loyalty program has doubled in the last 18 months in India and the market remains Amazon’s fastest growing for Prime worldwide.

However, North Korea said it remains unchanged in its position to resolve all issues through dialogue and negotiation.",Reuters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean spokesman said on Thursday the United States’ recent mid-range cruise missile test and plans to deploy F-35 jets and offensive military equipment around the Korean peninsula were “dangerous” moves that would “trigger a new cold war” in the region. North Korea remains unchanged in its position to resolve all issues through dialogue and negotiation, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said, but “dialogue accompanied by military threats is of no interest to us,” according to state media KCNA. “Dangerous and unusual military moves are now on the horizon, which would trigger a new cold war on the Korean peninsula and in the region,” the statement added.  Working-level talks between the United States and North Korea have yet to restart since they were stalled by the failed second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi in February.  Trump and Kim met again in June at the inter-Korean border and agreed to reopen negotiations.  U.S. envoy Stephen Biegun, who leads working-level talks with North Korea, has been in Seoul since Tuesday after a stop in Japan to discuss the denuclearization of North Korea.  “We are prepared to engage as soon as we hear from our counterparts in North Korea,” Biegun said on Wednesday.   The KCNA statement also echoed North Korea’s repeated protest against high-tech weapons being imported by South Korea such as F-35 stealth jets, calling them “grave provocations.”  The Pentagon said on Monday it tested a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 500 km (310 miles), the first such test since the United States pulled out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). North Korea has fired several short-range missiles in recent weeks, citing the need to strengthen its own security.

4599,Trump suggests India must fight Islamic State in Afghanistan,"US President Donald Trump has suggested that India must fight the Islamic State militant group in Afghanistan, saying, ""India is right there, they are not fighting it, we are fighting it."" ""The United States is 7,000 miles away...All of these other countries where Islamic State is around...all of these are going to have to fight,"" he added.",RT,"“Look, India is right there. They are not fighting it. We are fighting it,” Donald Trump complained to reporters on Wednesday. “Pakistan is right next door. They are fighting it very little. Very, very little. It’s not fair. The United States is 7,000 miles away.”“At a certain point Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, they are going to have to fight their battles too,” the president continued in response to a question about the alleged reemergence of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terror groups in Afghanistan. While he did not explain how the war that began nearly two decades ago when the US invaded Afghanistan had become its neighbors’ battle to fight, he hinted that it could easily become a problem for them if they didn’t help keep the terrorists in check.“All of these other countries where ISIS is around…all of these are going to have to fight,” he warned. The US would not spend “another 19 years” in what is already the longest war in its history.Trump incongruously took the opportunity to pat himself on the back for “destroying ISIS 100 percent,” suggesting that at least those other countries will have little to do to maintain order – though Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insists the decimated terror group is “gaining strength” now that Trump has raised the possibility of pulling out of the region.With India and Pakistan already occupied with the tensions in Kashmir, and Russia – which actually did the work of defeating IS in Syria (often reinforced by the US-backed “moderate rebels”) – most likely uninterested in wading back into a quagmire it exited decades ago, it’s unclear who among the countries Trump addressed might take him up on his offer to share the clean-up job in Afghanistan.Iran is already suffering from a “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign, and Washington considers it to be a “terrorist regime” anyway. Iraq barred US planes from its airspace on Wednesday after an alleged Israeli airstrike on Baghdad, while Turkey is facing sanctions for choosing Russian missile defense systems over a notoriously troubled US fighter jet.While Trump has periodically floated a total withdrawal from Afghanistan, he suggested on Tuesday that he would leave “somebody there” to ensure the Taliban did not take over – though the Taliban already holds more than half the country, despite trillions of dollars poured into the war since 2001.Think your friends would be interested?

4601,Stigma associated with rape should be abolished: Richa,"Actress Richa Chadha, who will next be seen in 'Section 375', said in an interview that social stigma associated with rape should be abolished and added that ""rape cases often don't get reported"". She said, ""The phrases used to describe rape are izzat lootna or naak katna."" ""One wonders why cops are reluctant to register FIR,"" Richa further added.",Times Now,"Actress Richa Chadha has raised concern over lack of strict laws for rape cases in India.

""There are myriad problems in India when it comes to reporting gender crimes. The statistic is worrying that rape cases often don't get reported because of the social stigma attached to rape. The phrases used to describe rape are izzat lootna or naak katna. There needs to be a multifaceted approach to fix this so we need to fix this on multiple levels. The society needs to be more aware. One wonders why cops are reluctant to register FIR. No law is made without context so after the Nirbhaya rape case, there were amendments to the clauses of rape law. But to what extent is it followed and implemented is crucial to determine how successful rape law is. The conviction rate of rape in India is fairly high contrary to popular belief,"" she said. 

Richa will be seen essaying the role of a public prosecutor in the upcoming film Section 375. In the movie, she will fight to get justice for her client, who claims she was raped by a filmmaker (played by Rahul Bhatt), who is defended by Akshaye Khanna's character in court. 

For Section 375, Richa says she did ""extensive research"".

""It has to start with wearing black and white, and turning up with tied hair neatly. Female lawyers dress plainly to not attract attention, in order to be taken more seriously. Mentally, I did extensive research and (director) Ajay Bahl had a lot of material on reported versus unreported rape cases. The UN women foundation material was available for reading, and some great women lawyers guided me on how to approach cases of sexual violence. I met private defence lawyers and public prosecutors, and I was surprised to read so much about gender violence in the country,"" said Richa.

Section 375 will release on September 13.

The letter said this has added to the mental stress among people already living with high-levels of psychosocial stress.",The News Minute,"After the Lancet’s publication, it is now the British Medical Journal (BMJ) which has drawn the attention of the medical fraternity in the country – a letter was recently published in the journal where doctors stated that the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir is preventing people from accessing healthcare. The letter was written by 18 doctors across the country expressing their concerns regarding the plight of those unable to access the required healthcare.“The lockdown and snapping of all modes of communication has made it very difficult for people in the Kashmir valley to access healthcare. From various news reports that are available from Srinagar the capital city, the picture that emerges is grim. People are unable to call an ambulance to take a sick person to hospital – they need to be taken a private vehicle if they have access to one. These vehicles are stopped every few metres by security forces standing at concertina wire barricades to check identity and ask questions,” states the letter, which was published on August 16.The doctors have also stated that they are worried about patients who require dialysis and chemotherapy but have been unable to make it to the hospital for their appointments. In addition, there have also been several accounts of pregnant women being unable to reach the hospital for their deliveries, which the doctors have highlighted in their letter as well.“The situation has also led to a lot of mental stress among a population already living with high levels of psychosocial stress. Some women due to deliver were moved closer to a hospital when the troop buildup began as they anticipated some trouble. There are likely to be many more women who are not able to get to a hospital for their delivery or have got there very late,” write the doctors.The letter was coordinated by Dr Ramani V Atkuri, a public health consultant from Madhya Pradesh.

We have had limited contact with our staff, which has prevented us from gathering information about the medical needs of the population on the ground,” reads a statement by the organisation.Earlier, the Lancet journal had published an article titled 'Fear and uncertainty around Kashmir's future', voicing its concerns over the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. This was met with scrutiny from the Indian Medical Association, which stated that the journal had ""committed breach of propriety in commenting on India’s political issue.""",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/open-letter-18-doctors-india-voice-concern-over-health-kashmiri-patients-107604?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Although Sri Lanka did not qualify for the semi-finals, under Karunaratne, they beat hoists England in a stunner and defeated the West Indies.READ: Dilruwan Perera added to Sri Lanka’s squadIn the first Test at Galle against New Zealand, Karunaratne led from the front in Sri Lanka’s second innings and scored a match-winning 122 which helped pave the way for a successful chase of 268. Lauding the efforts of his captain, Dickwella spoke about some amazing qualities which Karunaratne brings to the table as a leader.“Dimuth is a very different kind of captain,” he said. “His way of managing players is different, and every captain has their own style. I’ve played a lot with Dimuth and what he does is give the player the freedom to go and express themselves 100% in the match.“What Dimuth says is go and do what you want to do, and what you feel you can do. If we make a mistake, he’ll pull us aside and say this happened, why don’t we fix that mistake for next time? He talks a lot about being confident about your abilities. And he gives you that confidence.”Having won the first Test to secure a 1-0 lead, Sri Lanka’s third under Karunaratne, the team moves to Colombo, where their record isn’t too great. Of their previous seven Tests at the venue, Sri Lanka have tasted defeat in five. Dickwella feels the conditions will favour the batsmen more in Colombo, a stark contrast to Galle, where neither team could manage to conjure 300.“It’s a big challenge. Having won one game, we have a big responsibility to win the series. We have the confidence, but we need to keep making good decisions at crunch moments,” Dickwella said. “Close-in fielders, including me, have missed some chances in Galle, but those were difficult chances – you don’t have even seconds to react. But still, we spoke about that. We’re happy to improve on those areas.“In the batting, we were 142 for 2 and then collapsed to 168 for 7 in the first-innings, so we have to improve on that as well. When it comes to bowling, when one bowler is bowling well, from one end, we need to build a partnership from the other end as well.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/sri-lanka-vs-new-zealand-2019-he-allows-players-to-express-themselves-100-percent-niroshan-dickwella-on-his-skipper-dimuth-karunaratne-882401?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Banerjee, who has applied for Team India bowling coach position, said Umesh needs to check his line and length.",Cricket Country,"October 14, 2018 – Umesh Yadav’s maiden 10-wicket haul helped India thrash West Indies in the second Test at Hyderabad. Cut to August 21, 2019, the eve of the two-match Test series opener at Antigua, against the same opposition, and the fiery fast bowler seems no where in sight to stake claim for a place in the playing XI.It hasn’t been an easy ride for the Vidarbha pacer in the past year. The 31-year old played only five Tests in 2018, and just one during the tour of Australia where he claimed two wickets in Perth. However, the tour to West Indies began positively with Umesh picking up three wickets in the first innings in Antigua against West Indies A.So, what went wrong with Umesh, who has not played for India since the last eight months?“It was a matter of hitting the right areas, adapting to different conditions, specially to the red and white ball. On certain days, the ball moves a bit more, while on others, it goes a little straighter. Umesh needs to check his line and length,” Yadav’s childhood coach Subroto Banerjee tells CricketCountry.After this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL), Umesh went back to Banerjee at his academy in Vidarbha to work on his bowling. “I was talking to him on how to sort out these adjustments. I have sorted out a few things like getting his length back on track, hitting the right areas and a little bit of strategising. At the moment, he’s looking good,” former India pacer Banerjee explains.READ: Umesh Yadav: Refreshed and recalculated fast bowler targets Test success after time awayWhile Umesh has had to warm up the bench for most part last year, the situation has not affected him mentally. “His mental frame of mind is really strong. I have never doubted that. Whatever situation you throw him in, he will always find a way out,” Banerjee said about his student.On the mental front, Banerjee expects Umesh to be a little smarter.“When you run with that ball, your mindset has to be correct and he should be clear what he’s going to do. After representing India for 9-10 years, you cannot do too much (in terms of changing the bowler), but you can get clever as a bowler. These are the things he has to work on, which we also did it during that one week. He has to become a little smarter,” he said.ALSO READ: ‘Umesh Yadav is a captain’s fast bowler’“Umesh has all the variations, he is most talented bowler, but now he needs to utilise that talent and turn it into a good performance. I always keep telling him that I will keep advising you, but it’s up to you to implement it. He should not hesitate to implement it or have no fear about going for runs. In bowling, the more you think, the more you will suffer. When you are in for that run-up, think of uprooting that wicket, that’s all.”Meanwhile, Banerjee has also thrown his hat into the ring for the position of India’s bowling coach. “It went well.

4643,Fires in Amazon rainforests increased by 83% in 1 year: Brazil,"Amazon rainforest fires have increased by 83% so far in 2019 over the same period of 2018, Brazil's space research unit INPE revealed. The surge is the highest since records began in 2013, it added. ""There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or rainfall in Amazon region, which is just a little below average,"" an INPE researcher said.",Reuters," (This copy published on August 21, 2019, has been updated to correct to say fires highest since 2010 and removes reference to record.) By Lisandra Paraguassu BRASILIA (Reuters) - Wildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest have jumped this year, with 72,843 fires detected so far by Brazil’s space research center INPE, as concerns grow over right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro’s environmental policy. The surge marks an 83% increase over the same period of 2018, the agency said on Tuesday, and is the highest since 2010. Since Thursday, INPE said satellite images spotted 9,507 new forest fires in the country, mostly in the Amazon basin, home to the world’s largest tropical forest seen as vital to countering global warming.   Images show the northernmost state of Roraima covered in dark smoke. Amazonas declared an emergency in the south of the state and in its capital Manaus on Aug. 9. Acre, on the border with Peru, has been on environmental alert since Friday due to the fires. Wildfires have increased in Mato Grosso and Para, two states where Brazil’s agricultural frontier has pushed into the Amazon basin and spurred deforestation. Wildfires are common in the dry season, but are also deliberately set by farmers illegally deforesting land for cattle ranching. The unprecedented surge in wildfires has occurred since Bolsonaro took office in January vowing to develop the Amazon region for farming and mining, ignoring international concern over increased deforestation. Asked about the spread of uncontrolled fires, Bolsonaro brushed off criticism, saying it was the time of the year of the “queimada” or burn, when farmers use fire to clear land. “I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame. But it is the season of the queimada,” he told reporters. Space agency INPE, however, said the large number of wildfires could not be attributed to the dry season or natural phenomena alone. “There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or the rainfall in the Amazon region, which is just a little below average,” said INPE researcher Alberto Setzer. People frequently blame the dry season for the wildfires in the Amazon, but that is not quite accurate, he said. “The dry season creates the favorable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,” Setzer said. Bolsonaro recently fired the director of INPE after he criticized agency statistics showing an increase in deforestation in Brazil, saying they were inaccurate. “I am waiting for the next set of numbers, that will not be made up numbers. If they are alarming, I will take notice of them in front of you,” he told reporters.

4644,NGOs may be burning Amazon forest to shame my govt: Brazil President,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday said that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) could be burning down the Amazon rainforest to bring shame on his government after he cut their funding. Bolsonaro said ""everything indicates"" that NGOs are going to the Amazon to ""set fire"" to the forest but presented no evidence. ""These people are missing the money,"" he added.",Reuters,"BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday accused non-governmental organizations of burning down the Amazon rainforest to hurt his government, as a growing global outcry against the wildfires raged through social media. Presented without evidence and disputed by environmental and climate experts, Bolsonaro’s comments enraged critics and fanned a growing social media campaign over the dangers to the Amazon, one of the world’s key bulwarks against climate change. #PrayforAmazonas was the world’s top trending topic on Twitter on Wednesday, and millions of people took to Instagram and Facebook to share concerns over the future of the Amazon. With global awareness growing, Bolsonaro’s comments risk creating a spiralling crisis for his government, imperilling an EU-Mercosur trade pact and upsetting key agribusiness clients.   “Everything indicates” that NGOs were going to the Amazon to “set fire” to the forest, Bolsonaro said in a Facebook Live broadcast on Wednesday morning. When asked if he had evidence to back up his claims, he said he had “no written plan,” adding “that’s not how it’s done.” The former army captain turned politician said the slashing of NGO funding by his government could be a motive.  “Crime exists,” he said. “These people are missing the money.” Bolsonaro said his administration was working to control the Amazon fires, which have reached a record number this year. Brazil’s space research centre, INPE, has detected 72,843 fires so far in 2019, an 83% increase on the same period in 2018.   Environmental and climate experts labelled his claims that NGOs were responsible a “smoke screen” to hide his government’s dismantling of protections for the world’s largest tropical rainforest. They said farmers clearing land were responsible for the uptick in fires.  “This is a sick statement, a pitiful statement,” said Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace Brazil’s public policy coordinator. “Increased deforestation and burning are the result of his anti-environmental policy.”  Bolsonaro, a longtime sceptic of environmental concerns, wants to open the Amazon to more agriculture and mining, and has told other countries worried about rising deforestation under his watch to mind their own business. Congressman Nilto Tatto, leader of the lower house environment caucus, said Bolsonaro’s “stunning” attack on NGOs was an attempt to obscure his administration’s destruction of 30 years of Brazilian environmental protections. Climate scientist Carlos Nobre said farmers seeking to clear land for cattle pastures wait for the dry season when forests become combustible and then set them alight. He attributed this year’s spike to illegal deforestation since it has not been unusually dry. “NGOs working in the Amazon do not use fire in farming. On the contrary, they encourage rural communities to avoid fire,” said Nobre, senior researcher at Sao Paulo University’s Institute for Advanced Studies. Former presidential candidate and environment minister Marina Silva took to Twitter to criticize Bolsonaro. “The Amazon is on fire,” she wrote. “The president says NGOs may be behind this. The lack of commitment to the truth is a chronic pathology. This irresponsible attitude only aggravates an environmental disaster in Brazil.”        Speaking later on Wednesday, Bolsonaro also took aim at the Paris climate accord, saying that if it were so good, the United States would have stayed in it. But he added that for the time being, Brazil would remain in the pact.  French President Emmanuel Macron warned in June he would not sign the EU-Mercosur trade treaty if Bolsonaro pulled Brazil out of the Paris accord. Earlier this month, Norway and Germany suspended funding for projects to curb deforestation in Brazil after becoming alarmed by changes to the way projects were selected under Bolsonaro.

4649,Sleepwalking UK man found not guilty of sexually assaulting woman,"A jury in the UK has found a 21-year-old man with a history of sleepwalking not guilty of sexually assaulting his friend's girlfriend by reason of insanity. Dale Kelly sleepwalked into the coupleÂ’s bedroom, got into their bed and touched the woman intimately in 2017. Kelly said he was dreaming and thought he was with a woman he was dating.",Times Now,"New Delhi: A jury in northeast England acquitted a 21-year-old man accused of sexually assaulting his friend's girlfriend based on the argument that he was sleepwalking at the time of the incident and cannot be held responsible for his actions. A woman had accused Dale Kelly of committing the offence at a home in North Yorkshire in April of 2017.In her complaint, the woman had stated that she went to a nightclub with her boyfriend and his friend Dale one night in April of 2017. The three returned to their home on the morning of April 17 of last year. Kelly, who fell asleep in the cab on the way back home, went to sleep as soon as the three reached home. While the woman and her boyfriend took one of the rooms, Dale occupied a separate room.The woman alleged that she woke up to the sight of Kelly lying in the same bed as her and her boyfriend. She then alerted the local police and a case of sexual assault was registered against him. Dale was soon arrested and sent for a medical examination which revealed that he was suffering from a sleep disorder more commonly known as parasomnia, said a report. A jury at a York Court cleared Kelly of the charges made against him and said that he was not responsible for sexually assaulting the complainant while sleepwalking.Arguing on behalf of Kelly, Eleanor Fry said that her client was dreaming at the time he climbed onto the bed and was thinking about a woman he was dating at the time. During the course of the trial, Fry told the jury and the court how her client had been suffering from parasomnia since childhood.As a result, the jury found Kelly to be not guilty by reason of insanity. Such a verdict is usually returned when a court finds that a pre-existing condition has rendered the defendant helpless and unlikely to take responsibility for their actions. In this case, the condition was parasomnia. Usually, such a verdict is followed by a court order directing the defendant to seek medical treatment for the said condition.While delivering the verdict, judge Simon Hickey said that the case was not an easy one. He added that the doctors told him how Kelly's mental disorder could be treated. Hickey said that he would like to hold on to his sentencing options before hearing from experts about improvement in Kelly's condition.",https://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/crime/article/uk-court-sleepwalking-man-not-guilty-of-sexually-assaulting-his-friends-girlfriend/473125?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4652,Germany sells world's first 30-year bond with no interest payments,"Germany on Wednesday sold the world's first 30-year bond that doesn't offer any interest payment, meaning investors would receive nothing for lending their money. Investors who hold the bonds until they mature in 2050 will actually lose money as the bonds will offer a yield of -0.11%. However, Germany only raised Â€824 million against its Â€2-billion target.",Reuters,"(Updates prices) By Dhara Ranasinghe and Michelle Martin LONDON/BERLIN Aug 21 (Reuters) - Germany sold 30-year bonds with a negative yield for the first time at an auction on Wednesday, a milestone for a fixed-income market where the entire curve now yields less than zero. The euro zone’s benchmark bond issuer sold 824 million euros of the new long-dated bonds against a target of 2 billion euros, with an average yield of -0.11%. The coupon on the bond was set at 0% earlier this week. Bond yields across major markets have tumbled this year on worries about weak growth and speculation about central bank easing. Ultra-long-dated bonds have outperformed as investors move into longer and longer-dated maturities to grab a few extra basis points of yield. The decline in 30-year bond yields in recent weeks meant tepid demand at Wednesday’s bond auction was no surprise, analysts said. German 30-year yields are down 28 basis points this month and set for the biggest monthly drop since 2016. “It was a litmus test for just how willing the market was to take down a 30-year Bund with a 0% coupon, and there was a lack of commitment, of willing that is significant,” said Matt Cairns, a rates strategist at Rabobank in London. “Opinions are likely to change in the foreseeable future given an announcement from the ECB, which is likely to drag yields even lower.” The European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates when it meets next month and deliver other easing measures to shore up a flagging economy and boost inflation. In Germany, that has pushed the entire yield curve below 0% . Germany’s bond yields rose on Wednesday before the auction and briefly extended those increases after the auction results. As trading wound down in European hours, Germany’s 30-year bond yields was flat on the day at -0.17%, holding above last week’s record-low -0.31%.

Below 0%, investors are essentially paying governments to hold their debt — a move that can be profitable if investors are willing later on to pay more for holding government debt. In the past year, German 30-year bonds have returned over 30%, compared with returns of around 10% on 10-year Bunds. This comes as the pool of negative-yielding bonds deepens globally. “The more structural theme now is what now happens to institutional demand with the whole German bond yield curve below zero,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. “It shows that the market is still concerned about the macro backdrop,” he said, referring to the auction results.

4659,China's parliament rules out allowing same-sex marriage,"A Chinese parliament spokesman on Wednesday ruled out allowing same-sex marriages in China. Â“This rule suits our countryÂ’s national condition and historical and cultural traditions,Â” Zang Tiewei, spokesman for parliamentÂ’s legal affairs commission said. Â“As far as I know, the vast majority of countries in the world do not recognise the legalisation of same-sex marriage,Â” he added.",Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Limiting marriage to a relationship between a man and a woman will remain China’s legal position, a parliament spokesman said on Wednesday, ruling out following neighboring Taiwan in allowing same-sex marriage, despite pressure from activists. Taiwan’s parliament passed a bill in May that endorsed same-sex marriage, after years of heated debate over marriage equality that has divided the self-ruled and democratic island. China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has a thriving gay scene in major cities, but there has been little sign the ruling Communist Party will legalize same-sex marriage.     Asked at a news briefing whether China would legalize same-sex marriage, Zang Tiewei, spokesman for parliament’s legal affairs commission, said Chinese law only allowed for marriage between one man and one woman. “This rule suits our country’s national condition and historical and cultural traditions,” he said. “As far as I know, the vast majority of countries in the world do not recognize the legalization of same-sex marriage.” Individual Chinese legislators have occasionally in the past few years proposed measures during the annual meeting of the largely rubber-stamp parliament every March to legalize same-sex marriage, without success. There are no laws against same-sex relations in China and despite growing awareness of LGBT issues, the community has been the target of censors in recent months, fuelling fears of a growing intolerance. Activists have asked people in China to propose amendments to a draft civil code en masse, though they have admitted they see little chance of success. The parts of the code relating to marriage are expected to pass into law next year. The code makes changes on issues such as sexual harassment, divorce and family planning, but does not further the rights of the LGBT community, drafts published by parliament show. Zang said the marriage section of the draft civil code maintains the bond as being between a man and a woman. Prominent gay rights activist Sun Wenlin told Reuters he was disappointed in the comments, but not surprised. “I feel that my partner and I are sacrificing our happiness for the country’s legal system,” said Sun, who three years ago had his application to legally marry his partner rejected by a Chinese court. “They are undermining our life plan of choosing to marry the person we love.” He added, “I feel I am being excluded, and am absolutely not a consideration for policymakers.” Another activist, who asked not to be named, told Reuters there were cases in China of same-sex partners who had lost their homes after one of them died, as they lacked the legal protection of marriage. “We hope these tragedies don’t keen happening,” the activist said.

4660,Alibaba delays $15 bn Hong Kong share listing amid protests: Reports,"Amid political tensions in Hong Kong, China's Alibaba Group has delayed its up to $15 billion listing in the country, reports said on Wednesday. Alibaba is reportedly looking to launch the deal in October, which was initially set for late August. The delay was due to the lack of financial and political stability in Hong Kong, which has caused turmoil.",Reuters,"HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China’s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has delayed its up to $15 billion listing in Hong Kong amid growing political unrest in the Asian financial hub, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listing plans are being closely watched by the financial community for indications on the business environment in the Chinese-controlled territory and provides a window into Beijing’s reading of the situation. While no new timetable has been formally set, Alibaba could potentially launch the deal as early as October, still seeking to raise $10 billion-$15 billion, depending on whether political tensions had eased and market conditions became more favourable, one of the people said. The decision to postpone the deal, initially set to launch in late August, was taken at a board meeting before Alibaba’s earnings release last week, the second person said. The delay was due to the lack of financial and political stability in Hong Kong, the people added, following more than 11 weeks of frequently violent pro-democracy demonstrations which have plunged the city into turmoil.  Police have fired over 1,000 rounds of tear gas while more than 700 people have been arrested, followed by an unprecedented airport shutdown last week.  Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index fell to seven-month lows last week. “It would be very unwise to launch the deal now or anytime soon,” the first person said. “It would certainly annoy Beijing by offering Hong Kong such a big gift given what’s going on in the city,” the source added. Preparations for Alibaba’s listing, potentially the world’s biggest equity deal this year and the largest follow-on share sale in seven years, have been underway for some time.  Earlier this year, Altaba, the Yahoo offshoot holding the company’s stake in Alibaba, announced plans to sell up to its entire 11% stake - an event Alibaba would want to see completed ahead of its Hong Kong float to stabilise its U.S. trading volumes before investors need to adjust to the two prices that would be available following a Hong Kong listing. The Altaba sale has been completed, the second person said. Both people declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. Altaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.  Alibaba declined to comment on its Hong Kong deal plans. The second source, however, said Alibaba views the Hong Kong deal as a way to “diversify its access to capital markets”, but not as core to its business. Alibaba “does not see the postponement as a blow”, the person added.       Meanwhile, a listing by Alibaba is a big deal for the Hong Kong stock exchange, which is lagging behind its New York rivals in the annual battle to be the leading global listings venue. Just last month, Anheuser-Busch InBev cancelled a planned up to $9.8 billion Hong Kong IPO of its Asia Pacific unit. “It won’t be too bad for investors as long as Alibaba is going to Hong Kong, sooner or later,” said Connie Gu, a tech analyst at BOCOM International.  The delay could in fact temporarily benefit rival Chinese tech stocks such as Tencent Holdings Ltd and Meituan Dianping if it meant investors would hold off withdrawing their capital from those companies in preparation for investing in Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing, Gu added.  The city loosened its rules last year specifically to lure overseas-listed Chinese tech giants to list closer to home. Alibaba would be the first to test the new system.  Asked last week whether Hong Kong’s turmoil would affect Alibaba’s listing, Hong Kong stock exchange CEO Charles Li avoided directly acknowledging the company’s application, which is still technically confidential. But Li added: “I am confident that companies like that ultimately will find a home here, because this is home and I think they will come. I don’t know when though.” Reporting by Julie Zhu in Hong Kong and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Additional reporting by Yingzhi Yang in Beijing; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Jennifer Hughes",https://in.reuters.com/article/alibaba-listing/exclusive-alibaba-postpones-up-to-15-billion-hong-kong-listing-amid-protests-sources-idINKCN1VB06O?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
4661,Had to take on China: Trump amid growing concerns of US recession,"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday admitted that the trade war with China could put America under economic unrest. He said that he had to ""take on China"" because they had been cheating Washington for decades and ""taking out $500 billion a year plus"". Asked if the trade war could tip US into recession, Trump said it was ""irrelevant"".",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had to confront China over trade even if it caused short-term harm to the U.S. economy because Beijing had been cheating Washington for decades. Trump’s strongly worded comments came hours before his government announced approval of an $8 billion sale of Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a move sure to draw Beijing’s ire and further dim prospects for a quick trade deal. On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence had also poked China on another sensitive topic, Hong Kong, calling on Beijing to respect the integrity of the former British colony’s laws in its response to mass protests there. “Somebody had to take China on,” Trump told reporters during a White House visit by Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, when asked about wide-ranging tariffs he has imposed on imports from China. “This is something that had to be done. The only difference is I am doing it,” he said. “China has been ripping this country off for 25 years, for longer than that and it’s about time whether it’s good for our country or bad for our country short term. Long term it’s imperative that somebody does this,” he said. China’s Foreign Ministry appeared to downplay the comments. “That the two sides have differences in issues of trade and the economy is not something to be scared of. The key is to resolve the issues through dialogue,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday. Trump’s tariffs and threats of more to come have roiled global markets and unnerved investors as the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies stretches into its second year with no end in sight. Growing concerns that the trade war could trigger a possible U.S. recession weighed on financial markets last week and seemed to put administration officials on edge about whether the economy would hold up through the November 2020 presidential election.  Democrats on Sunday argued Trump’s trade policies were posing an acute, short-term risk. U.S. stock markets slumped last week on recession fears with all three major U.S. indexes closing down about 3% on Wednesday, although they pared their losses by Friday.  Trump, who is seeking re-election, again dismissed such fears, saying: “We’re far from recession.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC that U.S. and Chinese officials were expected to speak by telephone about the trade dispute over the next week to 10 days, followed by a possible face-to-face meeting.  But trade experts said the prospects for productive negotiations were clouded by Washington’s increasingly combative stance against China, including the arms sale to Taiwan and its increasingly tough language on Hong Kong. The Pentagon on Tuesday formally notified Congress that the U.S. State Department had approved the possible sale of 66 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control, has warned it could take unspecified “countermeasures” in response to the sale. Under Washington’s “one-China” policy, the U.S. government officially recognizes Beijing and not Taipei, while assisting Taiwan. It remains the main arms supplier to Taiwan. In a separate development, the U.S. International Trade Commission said it had found that subsidized steel rack imports from China had materially harmed U.S. industry, locking in duties imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department on such products. The Commerce Department last month said it had concluded that exporters from China had sold steel racks and parts at less than fair value, with total imports from China of such products amounting to about $200 million in 2017.

The actress has often been criticised for her statements on political issues and she has also seen indulging in a lot of work being the UN Goodwill Ambassador for Peace. The Government of Pakistan has now issued a letter to UN asking them to remove the actress from the position of Goodwill Ambassador for Peace over her statements on the issue. The Pakistani Government has written that the actress’ stand is the complete opposite of what should be of a UN Ambassador of Goodwill for Peace.The statement  reads, “I wish to draw your attention to the issue of Ms. Priyanka Chopra whom you have appointed as a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Peace. The recent crisis in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) has been the result of the Modi government's violatin of all international conventions that it is a signatory to, along with UNSC resolutions as well as conducting a campaign of ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Muslims in IOK. The Modi government is also denying 4 m Indian muslims of their citizenship in Assam creating ""detention centres"" akin to Nazi concentration camps. The Indian Occupation forces have also intensified their campaign of using pellet guns against women and children as well as violence and abuse of women in IOK. The entire policy of the BJP Government is similar to the Nazi doctrine of ethnic cleansing, racism, fascism and genocide. Ms Chopra has publicly endorsed this Indian government position and also supported the nuclear threat issued to Pakistan by the Indian Defene Minister.”It further continues, “All this goes completely against the principles of peace and goodwill that Ms Chopra is supposed to uphold as an UN Goodwill Ambassador for Peace. Her jingoism and support for violations by the Modi government of international conventions and UNSC resolutions on Kashmir, as well as support for war, including a nuclear war, undermines the credbility of the UN position to which she has been elevated.

YouTube said Brady filed dozens of takedown notices, falsely claiming that materials posted by other users infringed his copyrights. He allegedly asked some YouTubers for a small payment to avoid getting a third copyright claim, which could get their accounts terminated.",Engadget,"A lawsuit filed by YouTube yesterday claims that a user abused its copyright infringement reporting system to extort fellow YouTubers and carry out a swatting attack. YouTube alleges that Christopher Brady, of Omaha, Nebraska, filed dozens of Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices, which falsely claimed that materials posted by other users infringed his copyrights. Not only were the takedown notices bogus, they were allegedly part of Brady's plan to extort money from those users.According to Ars Technica, Brady made the false claims against three well-known Minecraft streamers. He then demanded they make payments of $150 to $300 via PayPal (or $75 to $200 in bitcoin). If they refused, he threatened to make a third copyright claim, which could get their accounts terminated.One of the targeted YouTubers filed a formal counter-notice, which required he share his name and address. That information is meant to help victims of copyright infringement file lawsuits, but a few days later, that YouTuber was swatted. While YouTube doesn't have proof that the swatting attack was carried out by Brady, the lawsuit says it ""appears"" he is responsible.YouTube has faced its fair share of copyright infringement disputes, and this isn't the first time its copyright claim system has been used for extortion. For years, the DMCA, meant to protect original content, has been called broken, harmful and obsolete. Earlier this summer, YouTube attempted to improve the system by demanding that those claiming infringement be specific in their complaints. This case is a reminder that the system is far from perfect, but if YouTube takes a strong stand against Brady, it may send a message to others with similar ideas.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/20/youtube-lawsuit-false-takedown-notices-extortion/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The other two teams in India’s group E are Afghanistan and Bangladesh.“The first two games are difficult but according to me, every single game is going to be difficult,” Gurpreet told IANS from Goa where the national team is holding its preparatory camp.“So, we just need to make sure that we play to our strengths and get something out of these two games to start with. We should have a lot of self-confidence and belief in our abilities,” said the 27-year old.Asked if the opening two fixtures are the toughest, the tall custodian said: “I cannot predict the future just like anyone else.

He was sure that if the country ever faces communal tensions, it will be due to RSS’ policies,” Dhariwal, a Congress leader, said.He said that when Mahatma Gandhi asked people of the country to celebrate Independence Day on January 26, 1930, and unfurl the tricolour, the RSS unfurled a saffron flag at its Shakhas instead of tricolour. The RSS people, he said, oppose the national anthem as they feel it doesn’t generate that intensity of patriotism in people.“RSS has been saying this since 1925 that the national anthem “Jana Gana Mana…” doesn’t instill a feeling of patriotism like a national song does. They were against the national anthem and also used to say it openly that there should be only one colour, saffron, in the flag, instead of tricolour,” the minister added.Dhariwal said that RSS people even today want to hoist a saffron flag in place of the national flag. “Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar (the second Sarsanghchalak) insulted the national flag most,” he said, according to a report in Hindi daily Amar Ujala.RSS is the world’s largest voluntary organisation.

Britain has said it is “extremely concerned” by reports that the staff member at the consulate in its former colony had been detained. Simon Cheng did not return to work on Aug. 9 after visiting the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen the previous day, Hong Kong news website HK01 reported, citing an interview with his girlfriend and family. Cheng’s family confirmed his disappearance in a Facebook post on Tuesday night, saying he travelled from Hong Kong to Shenzhen on the morning of Aug. 8 for a business trip. Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Shenzhen police had detained Cheng for 15 days by for violating public security management regulations. He gave no details. “He is not a British citizen. He is a Chinese person, so this is entirely a matter of China’s internal affairs,” Geng said. “As for Britain’s comments, we’ve made stern representations to Britain for the series of comments and actions they’ve made on Hong Kong,” he said. He also called on Britain to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs.  “Britain has made a series of wrong statements on Hong Kong. We again urge them to stop gesticulating and to stop fanning the flames,” Geng said. Shenzhen police declined immediate comment. Hong Kong police said Cheng left for China “around Aug. 9 with no further movement record we could find”. “Our liaison team had actually enquired with the mainland authority about the whereabouts of this gentlemen,” Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung told a news conference.  “However, the results are still pending.” Hong Kong has been gripped by anti-government protests in recent weeks, with China accusing Britain and other Western countries of meddling in its affairs. Britain, the United States and other countries have urged China to respect the “one country, two systems” formula under which Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Max Chung, a friend of Cheng, organised a small protest against his detention outside the consulate in Hong Kong. He said Cheng had not been involved in any of the anti-government demonstrations. “Simon’s case has shown very serious consequences to everybody in Hong Kong,” he told reporters, urging the British government to “save Simon now”.

""(Consumers) are extremely conscious of how many biscuits they're getting for a particular price,"" Parle's Category Head Mayank Shah said. He added that demand for Parle's popular products such as Parle-G had been worsening since GST rollout.",Reuters,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Parle Products Pvt Ltd, a leading Indian biscuit maker, might lay off up to 10,000 workers as slowing economic growth and falling demand in the rural heartland could cause production cuts, a company executive said on Wednesday. A downturn in Asia’s third-largest economy is denting sales of everything from cars to clothing, forcing companies to curtail production and raising hopes that the India government will unveil an economic stimulus to revive growth. A sharp drop in Parle’s biscuit sales means the company may have to slash production, which may result in layoffs of 8,000-10,000 people, Mayank Shah, category head at Parle, said in a telephone interview from Mumbai. “The situation is so bad, that if the government doesn’t intervene immediately ... we may be forced to eliminate these positions,” he said. Parle, founded in 1929, employs about 100,000 people, including direct and contract workers across 10 company-owned facilities and 125 contract manufacturing plants. Shah said demand for popular Parle biscuit brands such as Parle-G had been worsening since India rolled out a nationwide goods and services tax (GST) in 2017, which imposed a higher levy on biscuits costing as low as 5 rupees, or 7 cents a pack. The higher taxes have forced Parle to offer fewer biscuits in each pack, hitting demand from lower-income consumers in rural India, which contributes more than half of Parle’s revenue and where two-thirds of Indians live. “Consumers here are extremely price-sensitive. They’re extremely conscious of how many biscuits they are getting for a particular price,” Shah said. Parle, which has an annual revenue of above $1.4 billion, held talks over the past year with the government’s GST council as well as former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, asking them to review tax rates, Shah added. Once known as Parle Gluco, the Mumbai-headquartered company’s flagship biscuit brand was renamed as Parle-G, and became a household name in India through the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, Parle-G was considered the world’s largest selling biscuit brand. The slowdown in India’s economic growth, which has already led to thousands of job losses in its crucial automotive industry, was accelerating the drop in demand, Shah said. Market research firm Nielsen said last month India’s consumer goods industry was losing steam as spending in the rural heartland cools and small manufacturers lose competitive advantages in a slowing economy. Parle is not the only food product company to have flagged slowing demand. Varun Berry, managing director of Britannia Industries Ltd, Parle’s main competitor, said earlier this month that consumers were “thinking twice” about buying products worth just 5 rupees. “Obviously, there is some serious issue in the economy,” Berry had said on a conference call with analysts. Shares in Britannia were down 1.5%, as of 0620 GMT, having fallen as much as 3.9% earlier on Wednesday.
