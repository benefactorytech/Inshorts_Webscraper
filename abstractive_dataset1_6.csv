4748,World's largest processor with 1.2 trillion transistors unveiled,"US-based startup Cerebras Systems has unveiled the world's largest single silicon-based processor, the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine. The chip is the world's first trillion-transistor processor comprising 1.2 trillion transistors, 400,000 AI-optimised cores and 18 GB of memory. The chip, made especially to enhance the development work of AI, has 56 times more silicon area than the largest GPU.",TechCrunch,"Superlatives abound at Cerebras, the until-today stealthy next-generation silicon chip company looking to make training a deep learning model as quick as buying toothpaste from Amazon. Launching after almost three years of quiet development, Cerebras introduced its new chip today — and it is a doozy. The “Wafer Scale Engine” is 1.2 trillion transistors (the most ever), 46,225 square millimeters (the largest ever), and includes 18 gigabytes of on-chip memory (the most of any chip on the market today) and 400,000 processing cores (guess the superlative).Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine is larger than a typical Mac keyboard (via Cerebras Systems).Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine is larger than a typical Mac keyboard (via Cerebras Systems).It’s made a big splash here at Stanford University at the Hot Chips conference, one of the silicon industry’s big confabs for product introductions and roadmaps, with various levels of oohs and aahs among attendees. You can read more about the chip from Tiernan Ray at Fortune and read the white paper from Cerebras itself.Superlatives aside though, the technical challenges that Cerebras had to overcome to reach this milestone I think is the more interesting story here. I sat down with founder and CEO Andrew Feldman this afternoon to discuss what his 173 engineers have been building quietly just down the street here these past few years, with $112 million in venture capital funding from Benchmark and others.First, a quick background on how the chips that power your phones and computers get made. Fabs like TSMC take standard-sized silicon wafers and divide them into individual chips by using light to etch the transistors into the chip. Wafers are circles and chips are squares, and so there is some basic geometry involved in subdividing that circle into a clear array of individual chips.One big challenge in this lithography process is that errors can creep into the manufacturing process, requiring extensive testing to verify quality and forcing fabs to throw away poorly performing chips. The smaller and more compact the chip, the less likely any individual chip will be inoperative, and the higher the yield for the fab. Higher yield equals higher profits.Cerebras throws out the idea of etching a bunch of individual chips onto a single wafer in lieu of just using the whole wafer itself as one gigantic chip. That allows all of those individual cores to connect with one another directly — vastly speeding up the critical feedback loops used in deep learning algorithms — but comes at the cost of huge manufacturing and design challenges to create and manage these chips.Cerebras’ technical architecture and design was led by co-founder Sean Lie. Feldman and Lie worked together on a previous startup called SeaMicro, which sold to AMD in 2012 for $334 million (via Cerebras Systems).Cerebras’ technical architecture and design was led by co-founder Sean Lie. Feldman and Lie worked together on a previous startup called SeaMicro, which sold to AMD in 2012 for $334 million (via Cerebras Systems).The first challenge the team ran into, according to Feldman, was handling communication across the “scribe lines.” While Cerebras’ chip encompasses a full wafer, today’s lithography equipment still has to act like there are individual chips being etched into the silicon wafer. So the company had to invent new techniques to allow each of those individual chips to communicate with each other across the whole wafer. Working with TSMC, they not only invented new channels for communication, but also had to write new software to handle chips with trillion-plus transistors.The second challenge was yield. With a chip covering an entire silicon wafer, a single imperfection in the etching of that wafer could render the entire chip inoperative. This has been the block for decades on whole-wafer technology: due to the laws of physics, it is essentially impossible to etch a trillion transistors with perfect accuracy repeatedly.Cerebras approached the problem using redundancy by adding extra cores throughout the chip that would be used as backup in the event that an error appeared in that core’s neighborhood on the wafer. “You have to hold only 1%, 1.5% of these guys aside,” Feldman explained to me. Leaving extra cores allows the chip to essentially self-heal, routing around the lithography error and making a whole-wafer silicon chip viable.Those first two challenges — communicating across the scribe lines between chips and handling yield — have flummoxed chip designers studying whole-wafer chips for decades. But they were known problems, and Feldman said that they were actually easier to solve than expected by re-approaching them using modern tools.He likens the challenge to climbing Mount Everest. “It’s like the first set of guys failed to climb Mount Everest, they said, ‘Shit, that first part is really hard.’ And then the next set came along and said ‘That shit was nothing. That last hundred yards, that’s a problem.’ ”And indeed, the toughest challenges, according to Feldman, for Cerebras were the next three, since no other chip designer had gotten past the scribe line communication and yield challenges to actually find what happened next.The third challenge Cerebras confronted was handling thermal expansion. Chips get extremely hot in operation, but different materials expand at different rates. That means the connectors tethering a chip to its motherboard also need to thermally expand at precisely the same rate, lest cracks develop between the two.As Feldman explained, “How do you get a connector that can withstand [that]? Nobody had ever done that before, [and so] we had to invent a material. So we have PhDs in material science, [and] we had to invent a material that could absorb some of that difference.”Once a chip is manufactured, it needs to be tested and packaged for shipment to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who add the chips into the products used by end customers (whether data centers or consumer laptops). There is a challenge though: Absolutely nothing on the market is designed to handle a whole-wafer chip.Cerebras designed its own testing and packaging system to handle its chip (via Cerebras Systems).Cerebras designed its own testing and packaging system to handle its chip (via Cerebras Systems).“How on earth do you package it? Well, the answer is you invent a lot of shit. That is the truth. Nobody had a printed circuit board this size. Nobody had connectors. Nobody had a cold plate. Nobody had tools. Nobody had tools to align them. Nobody had tools to handle them. Nobody had any software to test,” Feldman explained. “And so we have designed this whole manufacturing flow, because nobody has ever done it.” Cerebras’ technology is much more than just the chip it sells — it also includes all of the associated machinery required to actually manufacture and package those chips.Finally, all that processing power in one chip requires immense power and cooling. Cerebras’ chip uses 15 kilowatts of power to operate — a prodigious amount of power for an individual chip, although relatively comparable to a modern-sized AI cluster. All that power also needs to be cooled, and Cerebras had to design a new way to deliver both for such a large chip.It essentially approached the problem by turning the chip on its side, in what Feldman called “using the Z-dimension.” The idea was that rather than trying to move power and cooling horizontally across the chip as is traditional, power and cooling are delivered vertically at all points across the chip, ensuring even and consistent access to both.And so, those were the next three challenges — thermal expansion, packaging and power/cooling — that the company has worked around-the-clock to deliver these past few years.Cerebras has a demo chip (I saw one, and yes, it is roughly the size of my head), and it has started to deliver prototypes to customers, according to reports. The big challenge, though, as with all new chips, is scaling production to meet customer demand.For Cerebras, the situation is a bit unusual. Because it places so much computing power on one wafer, customers don’t necessarily need to buy dozens or hundreds of chips and stitch them together to create a compute cluster. Instead, they may only need a handful of Cerebras chips for their deep-learning needs. The company’s next major phase is to reach scale and ensure a steady delivery of its chips, which it packages as a whole system “appliance” that also includes its proprietary cooling technology.Expect to hear more details of Cerebras technology in the coming months, particularly as the fight over the future of deep learning processing workflows continues to heat up.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/the-five-technical-challenges-cerebras-overcame-in-building-the-first-trillion-transistor-chip/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The staff reportedly said that there were no beds available. A video of the incident shows the woman lying on the floor with blood all around her as people walk past her.",Times Now,"Farukhabad: A state-run hospital in Uttar Pradesh turned away a pregnant woman in labour pain, forcing her to deliver the baby in the hospital's corridor on Sunday evening. The staff allegedly told the woman that there were no beds available to admit her. The incident happened in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Farukhabad district of the state. The woman's delivery was captured on a mobile phone by a passerby and was shared with local journalists in the area. Reportedly, while the woman was delivering the baby, men and women in the hospital were mere spectators and no one came forward to help her. In the visuals, the newly-born baby was lying in one end of the corridor on a red colour cloth piece and was after picked up by one of the woman relatives.According to a report, the woman was taken to the hospital's labour room by on-duty doctors after she gave birth to the baby in miserable conditions. Taking cognisance of the medical negligence, Monika Rani, the District Magistrate of Farukhabad told a news agency that she has already ordered a probe into the incident and she has also ordered an inquiry in the case. She further mentioned that they will try and ascertain the truth behind the incident. And if anyone is found guilty, strict action will be taken against the accused. Reportedly, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital is the only specialised government hospital in Farukhabad. The hospital made headline in 2017 as well when as many as 49 babies died in a month here. The news came days after reports of child deaths at Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur were reported due to lack of oxygen supply in the hospital. The incumbent BJP-government was widely criticised for the deaths. A similar case reported in January this year where a woman was turned away by the hospital staff citing lack of availability of beds forcing the woman to deliver her child on the roadside. This incident took place in Jalaun district of the state. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/civic-issues/article/uttar-pradesh-medical-apathy-woman-delivers-baby-in-govt-hospitals-corridor-in-full-public-view/472382?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

4760,"MIT's sensor can work underwater without battery, send data back","MIT researchers have developed battery-free underwater sensors and a communication system that uses near-zero power to transmit data back to the surface. They used a material that can transform pressure waves into electricity using the property 'piezoelectricity'. ""The system could be used to monitor sea temperatures to study climate change and track marine life over long periods,"" MIT said.",TechCrunch,"MIT researchers have created a new underwater sensor and communication system that doesn’t require batteries, and barely uses any power at all. This could help set up an underwater Internet of Things, according to MIT, which would allow for real-time sea temperature and marine life monitoring, without requiring regular equipment and power swaps to make it work. Without that requirement, it would even be possible to set up networks of underwater sensors in the seas of distant planets.The system, devised by MIT researchers, uses a transmitter that sends out sound waves underwater, which then hit sensors with embedded receivers, transmitting a tiny amount of energy in the process. The sensor then either uses that energy to answer back — or doesn’t, which corresponds to either a 1 or a 0, meaning it can effectively communicate in binary. The only energy required for this to work is the power stored in the sound wave sent by the transmitter.The inspiration for devising this system came from a somewhat unlikely source: Fadel Adib, an assistant professor in the MIT Media Lab  and one of the researchers who worked on the project, was watching nature doc “Blue Planet” and thought about how much of the Earth’s oceans are left unstudied, and also about how the solution for that can’t be battery-powered sensors as that could result in a lot of excess pollution.Essentially, the system works by allowing piezoelectric resonators, which have been used in things like microphones for well over 100 years, to either deform in response to a sound wave, or retain their shape and reflect, based on information contained in any kind of sensor you might want to pair with the piezoelectric material. That sends back the binary signal, which can then be collected and interpreted.Next up for the research team is to show that this can work at longer distances, and in concert with other sensors for simultaneous transmission. Eventually, it might even be able to transmit sound and even low-res images, which would be a huge development in terms of establishing remote monitoring stations — especially as we pursue more science and research on worlds not our own.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/mit-develops-a-sensor-that-can-work-underwater-without-a-battery-and-send-back-data/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

4778,250 inmates escape from prison set on fire during Indonesia riots,"Over 250 inmates escaped from a prison in Indonesia's West Papua province after protesters set fire to it during riots, officials said on Tuesday. The protests were triggered by the detention of Papuan students for allegedly disrespecting the Indonesian flag. Only five inmates had since been recaptured, local justice ministry spokesperson Marlien Lande said.",Reuters,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia sent 200 more police officers to Papua on Tuesday and reined in internet speeds to “prevent hoaxes from spreading” as civil unrest persisted in some parts of the country’s easternmost area, officials said. Thousands of Papuans took the streets of the cities of Sorong, Manokwari and Jayapura on Monday, blocking roads, damaging an airport and torching government buildings. The protests were triggered by the detention of Papuan students in the East Java city of Surabaya over accusations that they had disrespected the Indonesian flag in front of a dormitory during celebrations of Independence Day on Saturday.  Police fired tear gas into the dormitory before arresting 43 students, according to an activist, who said the students had been called “monkeys” during the operation. On Tuesday, the situation was calmer in some areas, but Papua’s deputy governor, Mohamad Lakotani, said by telephone that about 200 more police officers had been sent to Sorong from the island of Sulawesi amid continued tension. Lakotani said a “significant number” of Papuans took to the streets in Sorong again after Monday’s protests had seen the airport damaged, offices torched and a jail set ablaze. About 400 protesters were on the streets of Sorong on Tuesday, its police chief, Mario P. Siregar, told news portal Detik.com, while state news agency Antara said some streets were still being blocked by burning tires. Police were also hunting for more than 250 inmates who fled a jail in Sorong that was set ablaze during Monday’s unrest.  Protesters had attacked the jail among other buildings, said Ade Kusmanto, a spokesman for the director-general of correctional facilities at the Law and Human Rights ministry. “After burning the regional government’s office facilities, (protesters) headed to the prison and threw rocks, provoking  inmates,” said Kusmanto, adding that a prison warden had been injured in the unrest. The official said 258 inmates had escaped, from among 547 held in the jail, but added that some had since been recaptured, without elaborating. Internet bandwidth had also been intentionally slowed in some parts of Papua on Tuesday, mainly around Sorong, making it harder for people to send pictures and videos, a spokesman of the ministry of communication and information technology said.Similar measures were taken on Monday “to prevent hoaxes from spreading widely”, the ministry said in a statement.  Papuans were angry because of “the extremely racist words used by East Java people, the police and military,” Papua Governor Lukas Enembe has said. A separatist movement has simmered for decades in the resource-rich area of Papua, where there have been frequent complaints of rights abuses by Indonesian security forces. Rights groups urged Indonesian police to act with restraint and investigate the accusations of racism and discrimination faced by Papuan students. “Indonesian authorities must act promptly to de-escalate tensions in West Papua province and guarantee that people who wish to protest peacefully can continue to do so,” Usman Hamid, the Indonesia executive director of rights group Amnesty International, said in a statement.

NBFCs have been facing a credit crunch since IL&FS collapsed late last year. Further, the debenture reserve requirement for unlisted companies has been reduced to 10% of the outstanding debentures from 25%.",Reuters,"(Adds details) NEW DELHI, Aug 19 (Reuters) - India’s non-banking financial firms and listed companies that issue debentures will no longer have to maintain a certain level of redemption reserves against them, the government said on Monday, in an effort to increase the availability of money for lending. The non-banking finance companies, also known as shadow lenders, have been battling a credit crunch since IL&FS, or Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, collapsed in late 2018 amid fraud allegations. The fall of IL&FS, a major player in the market, pushed up borrowing costs for rivals and forced them to pull back on lending, hurting the availability of consumer loans. This has curbed consumer spending and hit sectors such as real estate and automaking that are big drivers of consumer demand. The move will also make it cheaper for the shadow lenders and listed companies to raise funds and deepen the nation’s bond market, the government said in a statement. The companies will no longer need to maintain a 25% reserve of the value of the outstanding debentures issued to the public or placed privately, the government said. It has also reduced the reserve requirement for unlisted companies to 10% of the outstanding debentures from 25%. The move will create more of a level-playing field between shadow lenders and commercial banks which are already exempt from maintaining such reserves, the government said.

4781,US says it removed 2.7 million barrels of Iranian oil from market,"The US has removed nearly 2.7 million barrels of Iranian oil from global markets after it reimposed sanctions on all purchases of Iranian crude, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. In May, the US ended sanction waivers given to importers of Iranian oil, including India. Iran reportedly exported about 100,000 barrels per day of crude in July.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has removed nearly 2.7 million barrels of Iranian oil from global markets daily as a result of Washington’s decision to reimpose sanctions on all purchases of Iran’s crude, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. In an interview with MSNBC, Pompeo said the U.S. government was confident it could continue with its strategy. The United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran in November after pulling out of a 2015 nuclear accord between Tehran and six world powers. In May, Washington ended sanction waivers given to importers of Iranian oil, aiming to cut Tehran’s exports to zero. Iran exported about 100,000 bpd of crude in July, according to an industry source who tracks such flows and data from Refinitiv Eikon. If condensate, a light oil, is included, shipments were about 120,000 bpd a day. “We have managed to take almost 2.7 million barrels of crude oil off of the market, denying Iran the wealth to create their terror campaign around the world, and we have managed to keep the oil markets fully supplied,” Pompeo said. “I am confident we can continue to do that,” he added. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other producers have been cutting 1.2 million bpd since Jan. 1 to reduce global supply. OPEC in July renewed the pact until March 2020 to avoid a build-up of inventories as worldwide demand is seen weakening. Despite OPEC’s actions along with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, Brent crude international oil prices LCOc1 have been relatively weak, falling on Tuesday to $59 a barrel from a 2019 high of $75, pressured by concerns about slowing demand. The exact level of Iranian exports has become harder to assess since U.S. sanctions returned in November, meaning estimates fall into a range rather than a definitive figure.

4785,He can bowl long spells at top pace: McGrath on Archer,"Speaking about England pacer Jofra Archer, former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath said, ""[B]rilliant sign that he can bowl long spells at top pace then come back and bowl second and third spells no problem at all."" ""It's just experience that he needs and he will be fine,"" McGrath said about the youngster who made his Test debut at the Lord's.",Cricket Country,"Jofra Archer produced one of the most menacing spells on Test debut at Lord’s during the second Ashes 2019 match. Case in question was the 24-year-old England pacer’s hostile bowling to Steve Smith, who was hit straight on the head on Day 4, which resulted in the former Australia captain retiring hurt on 80.So, what makes Archer one of the world’s most feared bowler and so difficult to face? Former Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath explains that Archer not only has pace, but accuracy as well which can be prolonged for as long as two to three spells or even more.ASHES 2019 FULL SCHEDULE | ASHES 2019 LATEST NEWS“It’s quite rare to be able to bowl with pace and accuracy for such a long time. To have pace is so unique and with Archer, it is all natural. His action doesn’t look too stressful, he has a nice, smooth run-up and goes through the crease really well,” McGrath wrote in his column for BBC Sport on Tuesday.READ: Three things we learnt from Lord’s Test“It’s a fairly stress-free action and he’s young and fit. He keeps it simple: he just comes in, bowls good areas and with good pace. At Lord’s he bowled some quite lengthy spells, but he maintained his pace throughout his overs. That is a brilliant sign that he can bowl long spells at top pace then come back and bowl second and third spells no problem at all.”McGrath feels Archer just needs to gain experience. “With a guy with his action and technique, I don’t see any reason why he can’t play plenty of Tests. It’s just experience that he needs and he will be fine,” the Australian, who snapped 563 wickets in 124 Tests, said.“Because he is such a natural, fast bowling comes quite easy to him. I think accuracy is always going to be nearly second nature. He’s not going to have a spell where he bowls a heap down the leg side.”With Archer coming into good form, England look to be hot favourites going into the third Test at Headingly that begins on August 22 (Thursday). McGrath reckons Mitchell Starc can come into the picture, but he cannot be as intimidating as Archer.ALSO READ: Pat Cummins equals best-ever Australian bowler rating of 914, set by Glenn McGrath“When Mitchell Starc, who has yet to play in this series, gets it right, he can bowl at 90mph and swing the ball. But he attacks the stumps – he doesn’t bowl aggressive spells like we saw Archer bowl so easily the other day. That’s probably the only thing with Starc – he bowls good pace and he’s going to get you out, but he’s not going to really intimidate you the way Archer does,” he noted.While it’s going to be a good contest at Headingly, McGrath feels that Australia do have the edge. “I’m still backing Australia, of course. I think England still have a lot of worries in their top order and with three Tests to go and Australia leading 1-0, England have to win at least two,” he said.“England will be buoyed by Archer coming in and doing as well as he did – but there’s a long way to go in this series yet.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/ashes-2019-glenn-mcgrath-explains-whats-so-special-in-jofra-archer-881949?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Naik is wanted in India for alleged money laundering and inciting terror.,Reuters,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Controversial Indian Islamic preacher Zakir Naik apologized on Tuesday for making racially sensitive remarks in Malaysia, after police banned him from speaking in public and questioned him for hours over the comments. Naik, who faces charges of money laundering and hate speech in India, has come under fire for comments that pitted Malaysia’s ethnic and religious minorities against the predominantly Muslim Malay majority. Malaysian police grilled Naik for 10 hours on Monday about a speech this month in which he said Hindus in Malaysia had “100 times more rights” than the Muslim minority in India, and that Malaysian Chinese were guests of the country. Race and religion are sensitive issues in Malaysia, where Muslims make up about 60 percent of its 32 million people. The rest are mostly ethnic Chinese and Indians, most of whom are Hindus.

He said his detractors had taken his comments out of context and added “strange fabrications to them”.   “It was never my intention to upset any individual or community,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.   “It is against the basic tenets of Islam, and I would like to convey my heartfelt apologies for this misunderstanding,” Naik said.

The experienced campaigner last plied his trade for the Edmonton Royals in the Global T20 Canada in Ontario.Hafeez was also a part of the national squad in the 2019 edition of the World Cup in England and Wales. In the mega event, he played eight matches in which he notched 253 runs at an average of 31.62. His top score of 84 came versus England at the Trent Bridge in Nottingham. The knock also helped his team open their account in the tournament with a closely-fought 14-run victory.AdvertisementHowever, he didn’t find a place in the list of centrally contracted players for the 2019-20 season. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) put forth 19 names and Hafeez, along with Shoaib Malik, weren’t included. But the duo would be available for selection. Last year, Hafeez decided to hang his boots from Test cricket after the series versus New Zealand in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).It was only in October that he made his Test comeback against Australia in the UAE after missing out on quite a few matches prior to that. Pakistan will play the T20 World Cup next year in Australia and it will be interesting to see whether Hafeez continues to play that far or not.Recently, the Punjab-born cricketer conducted a Question and Answer session on Twitter. There one of the users asked him about his plans of ‘giving up’ on cricket’. The fan took to Twitter and wrote, “Any plan for giving up on career?”The question didn’t go down well with Hafeez by any means. He replied to the fan, saying that it’s his career and he has the right to make the decisions, and ‘giving up’ doesn’t exist in his dictionary.

Chandrayaan-2 was launched on July 22.",The News Minute,"“For 30 minutes, our hearts almost stopped today,” shared ISRO chairman K Sivan, as India’s ambitious second moon mission Chandrayaan-2 crossed a major milestone by entering the lunar orbit on Tuesday. The ISRO chief was addressing a press conference in Bengaluru after the Chandrayaan 2 was successfully inserted into the moon’s orbit at 9.02 am on Tuesday and the total duration of the manoeuver was about 30 minutes (1,738 seconds).""The tension increased,” said Dr Sivan, when asked about the moments leading up to and after the insertion into the orbit.The next major step for the moon mission will be on September 2, when the Vikram lander is scheduled to separate from the orbiter. Vikram lander will separate from the Orbiter and then enter into a 100km x 30km orbit around the Moon.“On September 3, we will have a small manoeuvre for about 3 seconds to ensure that the systems of the lander are running normally,” Dr K Sivan said. The lander is expected to make the soft landing at the Moon’s south pole on September 7, at 1.55 am.“Even though we had a successful lunar orbit insertion today, the landing is a terrifying moment because till now the lander systems have not operated, that will only come after the 2nd (September). Then only we will know better. Why we are calling it a terrifying moment is because that is a phase which we will be doing for the first time. Today's lunar orbit insertion we have already done once, whereas the hover's descent, that will be a first for us and we may face difficulty there,” explained Dr K Sivan.The launch of Chandrayaan 2 was carried out successfully on July 22, 2019 by the GSLV Mk-III and had entered the Lunar Transfer Trajectory on August 14.The health of the spacecraft is being continuously monitored from the Mission Operations Complex (MOX) at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru with support from Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennas at Byalalu, near Bengaluru.

The government proposed abolishing Merchant Discount Rate, paid by merchants to banks, card payment networks and other intermediaries. ""I'm a firm believer in low economics, but no economics student can believe in no economics,"" Visa's India and South Asia head TR Ramachandran said.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Global card payments group Visa (V.N) is critical of the Indian  government’s decision to boost adoption of electronic payments by requiring banks and card payment networks to offer no-fee debit card transactions, a senior Visa executive said. Last month, India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that businesses with annual turnover of 500 million rupees will not have to pay a merchant discount rate on debit card and other digital modes of transactions, excluding credit cards. The discount rate is paid by the merchant to banks, card payment networks, and other financial intermediaries for handling a digital transaction. For debit cards, the fees are on average between 0.40% and 0.80% of the transaction amount, according to industry officials.  “I find the logic a bit fallacious because the cost is not free ... I am a firm believer in low economics, but no economics student can believe in no economics,” T.R. Ramachandran, Visa’s India and South Asia head, said on Monday, speaking on a panel at an industry conference.   Ramachandran said if the government, the merchant and the consumer are all saving on the cost of cash via an electronic payments mechanism then the stakeholders should be adequately compensated.  India’s Finance Ministry was not immediately reachable for comment on the matter outside of business hours.  Sitharaman had said in her budget speech that the Reserve Bank of India and banks would absorb these costs from the savings that will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move to digital payments.  But industry officials say there is still no clarity on who will pick up the tab.  The no-fee debit card plan could hit the fee revenues of banks, which are already burdened with bad loans of about $150 billion. As of May this year there were 824.9 million debit cards in circulation in India compared with 48.9 million credit cards, according to the Reserve Bank of India.

4831,Employees should find new projects or face salary cuts: Huawei CEO,"Huawei Founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei on Monday warned the company is at a ""live or die moment"" and advised redundant employees to form ""commando squads"" to explore new projects. Workers who fail will have their salaries cut every three months and may lose their jobs, the billionaire said. Notably, the US pushed a full ban on Huawei to November.",BloombergQuint,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co.’s founder Ren Zhengfei warned in an internal memo the company is at a “live or die moment” and advised underutilized employees to form “commando squads” to explore new projects. Workers who fail will have their salaries cut every few months and may lose their jobs, the billionaire said yesterday.Since May, Huawei has occupied the uncomfortable position of being both an established global technology brand and a member of the United States Entity List, which bars it from trading with American suppliers. Despite a series of 90-day reprieves, the latest of which came yesterday, the uncertainty caused by American sanctions has already cost the company a great deal. Even if Huawei is eventually brought in from the cold, the impact of this summer’s upheaval will be widespread and painful.The most immediate of Huawei’s losses is the international smartphone market. The company’s internal estimates show it expects to sell 60 million fewer phones in 2019 than it would have done without the U.S. impositions. In 2018, Huawei grew its mobile shipments by 34% to 206 million, according to IDC data, and in the first quarter of 2019 its pace accelerated to a 50% improvement while rivals Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. both saw shrinking sales. By the second quarter, partially affected by U.S. sanctions, Huawei’s growth had been slashed to 8.3%.Having successfully penetrated the European mobile market, Huawei was on a path to becoming the world’s biggest phone vendor, however the loss of Google’s Android, the brains inside its handsets, and the related Play Store app ecosystem made Huawei devices undesirable outside of China.Ren warned in his memo that redundant staff need to find a way to make themselves useful.“They either form a ‘commando squad’ to explore new projects -- in which case they could be promoted to company commander if they do well,” he wrote. “Or they can find jobs in the internal market. If they fail to find a role, their salaries will be cut every three months.”Read more: Huawei’s Founder Wants an ‘Invincible Iron Army’ to Fight U.S.The consumer division is, according to Huawei itself, its growth engine. Accounting for 45% of its revenue last year, the business that sells phones and other gadgets is instrumental to Huawei’s future health, and it’s taken a substantial reputation blow from all the allegations and sanctions levied against Huawei. That won’t be repaired anytime soon.On the same front is Huawei’s loss of software engineering time as it’s had to scramble to create a potential Android substitute. In the wake of the U.S. ban, the company switched to 24-hour days, working as many as 10,000 developers across three shifts and three offices to eliminate the need for American software and circuitry. Huawei ended up hurrying its HarmonyOS out this month, just to demonstrate it can code its own operating system, though it convinced very few people that it has anything approaching an Android alternative waiting in the wings.Read more: Huawei Engineers Go to 24-Hour Days to Beat Trump BanLess quantifiable but still significant will be the talent drain that Huawei suffers from the tarnishing of its global reputation and the overwork that’s resulted from its efforts to recover. The company has downsized its workforce in response to its new circumstances.Ren wrote that the company’s priorities are for employees to make “meritorious deeds” and for management “to promote outstanding employees as soon as possible and infuse new blood to our organization.”In explaining the fresh extension to Huawei’s reprieve from U.S. sanctions, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that some American telecoms are “dependent” on Huawei tech and need time to wean themselves off it. So while the Washington authorities are giving Huawei a little more breathing room, the company’s situation is still very much precarious, as its founder has indicated.Read more: Trump’s Huawei Ban Threatens to Throttle Global 5G RolloutWithout the U.S. trade intervention, Huawei would be threatening Samsung for the crown of the world’s most prolific smartphone vendor and it would be capitalizing on its lead in 5G technology instead of counting the cost of lost customers. The company remains in a strong position, but the dynamism of its growth and the luster of its cutting-edge technology have both been diminished by the measures taken by the American government.©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/huawei-founder-sees-live-or-die-moment-from-u-s-uncertainty?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

4836,Google's hand-tracking algorithm could help translate sign language,"Google's AI labs has released a new machine-learning algorithm that provides hand and finger tracking, which could lead to translating sign language to verbal. The algorithm inferred up to 21 3D points of a hand from just a single frame, researchers said. ""Our method achieves real-time performance on a mobile phone, and even scales to multiple hands,"" they added.",TechCrunch,"Millions of people communicate using sign language, but so far projects to capture its complex gestures and translate them to verbal speech have had limited success. A new advance in real-time hand tracking from Google’s AI labs, however, could be the breakthrough some have been waiting for.The new technique uses a few clever shortcuts and, of course, the increasing general efficiency of machine learning systems to produce, in real time, a highly accurate map of the hand and all its fingers, using nothing but a smartphone and its camera.“Whereas current state-of-the-art approaches rely primarily on powerful desktop environments for inference, our method achieves real-time performance on a mobile phone, and even scales to multiple hands,” write Google  researchers Valentin Bazarevsky and Fan Zhang in a blog post. “Robust real-time hand perception is a decidedly challenging computer vision task, as hands often occlude themselves or each other (e.g. finger/palm occlusions and hand shakes) and lack high contrast patterns.”Not only that, but hand movements are often quick, subtle or both — not necessarily the kind of thing that computers are good at catching in real time. Basically it’s just super hard to do right, and doing it right is hard to do fast. Even with multi-camera, depth-sensing rigs like those used by SignAll have trouble tracking every movement. (But that isn’t stopping them.)SignAll is slowly but surely building a sign language translation platformThe researchers’ aim in this case, at least partly, was to cut down on the amount of data that the algorithms needed to sift through. Less data means quicker turnaround.For one thing, they abandoned the idea of having a system detect the position and size of the whole hand. Instead, they only have the system find the palm, which is not only the most distinctive and reliably shaped part of the hand, but is square, to boot, meaning they didn’t have to worry about the system being able to handle tall rectangular images, short ones and so on.Once the palm is recognized, of course, the fingers sprout out of one end of it and can be analyzed separately. A separate algorithm looks at the image and assigns 21 coordinates to it, roughly coordinating to knuckles and fingertips, including how far away they likely are (it can guess based on the size and angle of the palm, among other things).To do this finger recognition part, they first had to manually add those 21 points to some 30,000 images of hands in various poses and lighting situations for the machine learning system to ingest and learn from. As usual, artificial intelligence relies on hard human work to get going.Once the pose of the hand is determined, that pose is compared to a bunch of known gestures, from sign language symbols for letters and numbers to things like “peace” and “metal.”The result is a hand-tracking algorithm that’s both fast and accurate, and runs on a normal smartphone rather than a tricked-out desktop or the cloud (i.e. someone else’s tricked-out desktop). It all runs within the MediaPipe framework, which multimedia tech people may already know something about.With luck, other researchers will be able to take this and run with it, perhaps improving existing systems that needed beefier hardware to do the kind of hand recognition they needed to recognize gestures. It’s a long way from here to really understanding sign language, though, which uses both hands, facial expressions and other cues to produce a rich mode of communication unlike any other.This isn’t being used in any Google products yet, so the researchers were able to give away their work for free. The source code is here for anyone to take and build on.“We hope that providing this hand perception functionality to the wider research and development community will result in an emergence of creative use cases, stimulating new applications and new research avenues,” they write.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/this-hand-tracking-algorithm-could-lead-to-sign-language-recognition/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

4848,Apple mistakenly lets hackers 'jailbreak' iPhones with iOS update,"Security researchers have found that Apple has reintroduced a vulnerability in the latest, iOS 12.4 update which let a hacker publicly release a 'jailbreak' for current, up-to-date iPhones. The jailbreak lets users run unsupported software and apps, which are otherwise banned by Apple. The flaw, earlier found by a Google hacker, was fixed in the iOS 12.3 version.",Engadget,"In the iPhone's early days, hackers would ""jailbreak"" the iPhone in order to install third-party apps that weren't available through the App Store. It's been a while since anyone seriously needed to jailbreak their iPhone, as there are plenty of apps and more customizable operating systems to choose from. But this weekend, hackers dusted off their jailbreaking skills when a vulnerability was discovered in iOS 12.4. Security researcher Pwn20wnd released the first free public jailbreak for a fully updated iPhone in years.According to Vice, iOS 12.4, the latest version, reintroduced a bug that was fixed in iOS 12.3. Several iPhone users took to Twitter, claiming they used the Pwn20wnd jailbreak on their phones.Unfortunately, the bug also makes it easier to hack iPhones. So, until iOS 12.4.1 comes out, many iPhones are at risk. One security researcher told Motherboard that someone could use this vulnerability to make a malicious app that could steal data from other apps on a user's phone. Given the security risks, you probably don't want to jailbreak your iPhone and you should beware of apps you download from the App Store until Apple re-patches the bug. If nothing else, this may take you on a memory lane trip, back to the days of the Cydia Store.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/19/iphone-jailbreak-bug-ios-vulnerability/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

4853,US tests first cruise missile since withdrawal from INF treaty,"The US tested a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 500 kilometres, the first since it withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia earlier this month. The missile was launched from the San Nicolas Island off the coast of Los Angeles. INF treaty banned the development of missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometres.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Monday it tested a conventionally configured ground-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 500 km (310 miles), the first such test since the United States pulled out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The United States formally withdrew from the landmark 1987 pact with Russia on Aug. 2 after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty, an accusation the Kremlin has denied. The treaty, negotiated by then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500 to 5,500 km). In a statement, the Pentagon said the test took place on Sunday at San Nicolas Island, California, and the missile hit its target after more than 500 km of flight.  The test would have been prohibited by the INF treaty.  “The testing by (the) U.S. military of a land-based missile banned under INF treaty two weeks after the official termination of this treaty is a blatant cynicism and mockery of the international community,” the RIA news agency cited Russian lawmaker Frants Klintsevich as saying on Monday. “We, of course, will do our best in the shortest period of time to ensure that the United States does not have a superiority in these types of weapons,” he said, adding that Russia did not intend to enter into an arms race.  U.S. officials had said for a number of months that they planned to carry out the test in August. The United States plans to test an intermediate-range ballistic missile in November. Moscow denies flouting the accord and has accused Washington of breaking the pact, allegations rejected by the United States. The dispute is aggravating the worst U.S.-Russia friction since the Cold War ended in 1991. Some experts believe the treaty’s collapse could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms. A Pentagon spokesman told Reuters that Sunday’s test used an MK41 launcher, but the system tested was not the same as the Aegis Ashore missile defense system currently operating in Romania and under construction in Poland. Russia’s Defense Ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for comment sent outside normal working hours. “Russia had alleged for years that the land-based MK-41 could launch Tomahawks and therefore would violate the treaty,” said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament research at the Arms Control Association advocacy group.  “Even though this is the first test of the combination, Russia will no doubt claim vindication,” Reif said. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said that while he is in favor of placing ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles in Asia, it could be years before such missiles are ready to be deployed.

He urged them to ""participate personally"" in discussions with Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and government officials on data localisation and e-commerce. ""My team at the Embassy stands by ready to help,"" Juster further stated.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The United States ambassador to India has written to top American technology firms assuring them of support for a level playing field in India, a letter seen by Reuters showed, amid Washington’s concerns over New Delhi’s protectionist policies. Kenneth Juster last month wrote to the heads of leading U.S. technology companies in India, urging them to “participate personally” in discussions with government officials in New Delhi on data localization and e-commerce, issues that have soured trade ties between the two nations. Industry executives with direct knowledge said it wasn’t common to receive such letters from the U.S. administration, but described the communication as the latest sign of Washington’s determination to deter India from measures that hurt its firms. “Our Embassy will continue working with you to ensure that U.S. firms compete on a level playing field. My team at the Embassy stands by ready to help,” Juster said in his letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. “We look forward to your continued success in India.” The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi did not comment on the letter, but said U.S. companies were the biggest source of foreign direct investment in India. “We hope that the Indian Government will pursue policies that create a welcoming and predictable environment for U.S. investors,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The United States and big technology companies say India has taken a series of protectionist measures by imposing stricter foreign investment rules for the online retail sector and outlining plans to force companies to store more of their data locally. The decisions have already dealt a blow to companies such as Amazon.com Inc, Walmart Inc, Mastercard and Visa, and the proposed data rules will also impact firms such as Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s Google. Such proposals, critics say, create entry barriers for foreign firms and favour domestic Indian corporations, leading to an unfair competitive landscape between the two. Indian officials have said the rules were aimed at protecting interests of its small traders and citizens’ privacy. Despite talks to resolve some of the trade disputes, there has been no major breakthrough: India said last month the countries had agreed to continue discussions “addressing mutual trade concerns”. In his letter, Juster also said he had met Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal who told him the government was adopting a “consultative approach” to the proposed regulations. There is some level of concern among U.S. officials that while Goyal has met industry officials in recent weeks, some top American company executives have not been forthright about expressing their policy concerns to the Indian government, two other sources aware of the communication said. “The Government of India is seeking stakeholder input, and, given the importance of these issues, we strongly encourage you to participate personally in future meetings with the Minister and other senior officials,” Juster said in his letter. It was not clear exactly how many companies received Juster’s letter, but the sources said at least four U.S. technology firms had received it. “It is not normal to get such letters, but these are not normal times,” said one of the executives.

Instagram said it's also inviting a select group of trusted security researchers to find flaws in its 'Checkout' shopping feature ahead of its international rollout. Facebook awarded researchers over $1 million under the program in 2018.,Engadget,"Facebook will start rewarding security researchers who report data abuse happening on Instagram, the company has announced. This is an expansion of Facebook's Data Abuse Bounty program, which it introduced in April 2018. As part of these efforts, Facebook will now start accepting reports about third-party apps that improperly access and store user data, including applications and services that offer fake likes, comments and followers. Essentially, any app that asks for people's login information (like usernames and passwords) is violating Instagram's terms of use -- and Facebook wants the security community to notify it of anyone who may be taking advantage of this.In addition to that, Facebook is working with security researchers to stress-test Checkout on Instagram, the shopping feature that lets people buy products without leaving the app, before it launches outside the US. Facebook says it has given a select group early access to Checkout on Instagram and will reward them for eligible reports. ""Putting people first is one of Instagram's most important values, and keeping our service secure is an essential part of the work we do to serve our community,"" said Nam Nguyen, Instagram's head of engineering. ""Expanding and building on the Facebook bug bounty program is a key development in our ongoing security efforts, and we are grateful to the wider security community for all they do to help keep our platforms safe.""Just to give you an idea of how much Facebook has paid people for their help, the company awarded more than $1.1 million to security researchers from across the world in 2018. And last year alone, Facebook says, the average payout for bugs that could lead to account takeover was increased to $40,000. All told, in 2018, Facebook received about 17,800 reports, with the average reward amount being around $1,500. Now that its Data Bounty Program covers Instagram, Facebook's hope is that with help from security researchers worldwide, it can keep the popular app safe from bad actors who could misuse people's data.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/19/facebook-data-abuse-bounty-program-instagram-checkout/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Aware of the new law that criminalises the practice, the woman refused to go to her parents' house. The woman's husband is absconding. The accused, Khush Mohammad gave triple talaq to his wife during an argument and allegedly thrashed her. The woman then reached the police station and lodged a complaint against her husband. On Monday, the woman told the police that the new law does not recognise triple talaq as a method of divorce and hence, she refused to accept that her husband had 'divorced' her. According to a report, the woman refused to leave her in-laws' house and said that she wanted to continue living there with her children. The police recorded the woman's statement and launched an investigation. The accused has not been arrested yet.

Yediyurappa had submitted the list to the Governor early morning on Tuesday. BJP's Yediyurappa became the CM after Congress-JD(S) alliance failed to prove majority during the floor test last month.",The Quint,"Nearly four weeks after taking oath on 26 July, 17 ministers led by Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa took oath as Cabinet members on Tuesday, 20 August, ending a long period of instability in the state.After multiple rounds of discussions internally and meetings with Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Yediyurappa had finally received the green signal to form his Cabinet on Monday.However, the list of ministers announced by Yediyurappa indicated a Lingayat-heavy cabinet with 7 of the 17 ministers belonging to the same caste.Seen as the face of the Lingayat community in Karnataka, it was expected that the CM would favour the Lingayat community and would have a tough time ensuring equal representation. However, Lingayats being a huge voter base for the BJP in Karnataka, also translated to the high command in Delhi not interfering too much with Yediyurappa’s choice.Also Read : After Amit Shah’s Green Signal, K’taka Cabinet Expansion on 20 AugSeven of the 17 new ministers – Jagadish Shettar, V Somanna, JC Madhuswamy, CC Patil, Laxman Savadi and Basavaraj Bommai – represent Lingayat interests and have returned to the Cabinet. Newcomer Sashikala Jolle, the only woman in Yediyurappa’s Cabinet, is also from the same community.Not only do the Lingayats form a huge chunk of the electorate in Karnataka, most of BJP’s MLAs are also Lingayats.Other castes have also found due representation in the form of B Sriramalu from the Valmiki Nayak community, R Ashok from the Vokkaliga community and Suresh Kumar representing the Brahmin community.LS Savadi, who lost the elections from the Athani constituency to Mahesh Kumathahalli, also found a place as a Cabinet minister.Along with CC Patil and J Krishna Palemar, Savadi had reportedly been forced to resign from the Assembly in 2012 following a row where the three ministers were found to have been viewing pornography inside the Vidhana Soudha.Savadi, who lost the Athani seat by a margin of approximately 2,000 votes, is believed to be the BJP’s choice for bypolls from the region after Congress’ Kumathahalli resigned from the party, leading to his disqualification under the anti-defection law.Also Read : Yediyurappa Wins Karnataka Trust Vote: A Brief Timeline of EventsKota Srinivas Poojari, an MLC from Udupi, also found his name in the list under the legislative council quota. Poojari was reportedly among the front-runners from coastal Karnataka who were vying for Cabinet posts.He is believed to be particularly popular in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada after serving as an MLC from the district for the past ten years.Independent MLA H Nagesh also found a place in Yeddiyurappa’s new Cabinet. Nagesh and Independent MLA R Shankar had earlier attracted state-wide scorn for ditching the previous Kumaraswamy government to pledge their support for the BJP at the time of the crucial floor test last month.There were a few surprises, however, in Yediyurappa’s final Cabinet with no MLA from Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada and Udupi districts finding a slot.Dakshina Kannada and Udupi have been a long-time bastions of the BJP with prominent names like Anantkumar Hegde, Shobha Karandlaje. Experts believe that they may find a place in the next round of Cabinet expansion that will be done to fill all the berths in the state Cabinet.Five-time MLA from Sullia, S Angara from Dakshina Kannada was also sidelined.While the posts of Cabinet ministers have been announced, there has been no announcement on which portfolio has been allotted to whom.(With inputs from The New Indian Express)(Hi there!

In the wake of the ban that is imposed on the singer after his performance in Pakistan amidst the ongoing India-Pakistan tension, a group of people was seen holding placards with slogans like Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Hindustan Zindabad, Desh Se Bada Paisa Nahi Hota, Shame! Shame on Mika Singh, Shame, and Go Back Pakistan Mika Singh written on them.If a tweet by the controversial singer is anything to go by, Mika requested Mumbai Police to stop the protest happening outside his house and thanked them for ""their immediate action to stop the violence"". Mika's tweet read, ""I would like to thank @MumbaiPolice @CPMumbaiPolice and #oshiwarapolice for their immediate action to stop violence by the #aiwca people and suresh .

4880,"Pak accuses India of using water as 'weapon of war', India rejects claim","Pakistan has accused India of using water to wage ""fifth-generation warfare"" claiming that the latter failed to inform them about the release of water from a dam that could cause flooding across the border. India, however, rejected the claim saying that according to the water treaty between them, it had informed Pakistan about the release of excess water on Monday.",Reuters,"ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Accusing India of waging “fifth-generation warfare”, Pakistan said on Monday New Delhi had failed to inform it about the release of water from a dam that could cause flooding across the border.  India, however, rejected the claim saying that under the terms of a water treaty between the two nations it had informed Pakistan about the release of excess water late on Monday when it crossed a certain threshold. Relations between the neighbors, already hostile, have been further strained over India’s decision this month to revoke the special status of its portion of the Kashmir region that both countries claim. Pakistan reacted with fury, cutting transport and trade links and expelling India’s ambassador in retaliation.  Islamabad said the unexpected release of water into the River Sutlej that flows from India to Pakistan was part of an attempt by New Delhi to flout the longstanding treaty between the countries. “They try to isolate diplomatically, they try to strangulate economically, they’re trying to strangulate our water resources – and water automatically will have an impact on your economy, your agriculture and your irrigation,” Muzammil Hussain, chairman of the Pakistani government’s Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), told Reuters. India was using its position upstream to wage “fifth-generation warfare” on the country, said Hussain. India’s federal water resources ministry told Reuters late on Monday that under the treaty advance information needs to be given in a situation when “extraordinary discharges of water from reservoirs and flood flows” could harm the other party. Until today no such extraordinary discharges had been observed on the Indian side in the current flood season. At 1900 IST (1330 GMT), the flow of Sutlej river reached the threshold level of high flood and the same was conveyed to Pakistan, the ministry said in a statement, adding that it is committed to the treaty. Pakistani emergency authorities were preparing for minor flooding in several areas in Punjab state on Monday as a result of the unexpected rise in water flow, though it was not clear if any had occurred. “India did not communicate the release of water to Pakistan,” Khurram Shahzed, director general of Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), told Reuters. India and Pakistan have long argued over water resources. A World Bank-mediated arrangement known as the Indus Water Treaty splits the Indus River and its tributaries - which 80 percent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on - between the countries.  India, which lies upstream, threatened in February to stop sharing excess water with Pakistan after a suicide bomb attack by a Pakistan-based militant group in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian paramilitary police. Hussain said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “threatened very clearly that he could stop water to Pakistan. He couldn’t care less (for) the treaties”. In 2016, after suspending a meeting on the Indus Water Treaty, Modi told government officials that “blood and water cannot flow together”.   India says a program of maximizing its water usage by building hydroelectric plants is in line with the treaty.

The apex court observed this while coming down heavily on the Delhi Transport Department, which has filed an affidavit raising objections over the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) asking it to purchase five machines to identify polluting vehicles.The department requested the court to consider asking it to purchase ""only one or two machines"" for remote sensing technology to identify such vehicles.""Do not you think that people and children should live in a clean environment?,"" a bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta told the counsel appearing for the Delhi Transport Department.""Why only one or two (machines)? Why not five?"".The bench said Delhi's air quality has been at its ""best"" now after such a long time.""Today, this year we have the best time so far as (far as) air quality is concerned,"" the bench said, adding, ""We are taking up this matter day in and day out to ensure clean air"".""You should not have filed such objections. You can raise valid objections,"" the bench observed.Senior advocate Aparajita Singh, who is assisting the top court as an amicus curiae in the pollution matter, also pointed out to the affidavit filed by transport department and said that air quality in Delhi has come to the best after such a long period only due to the orders passed by the court.""All this (improvement in air quality) has happened only because of the court,"" Singh told the bench.In its affidavit, the Delhi transport department has pointed out ""some shortcomings"" in the study conducted by International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) which has scanned about 1.76 lakh vehicles and found the remote sensing technology to be useful.""As regards the EPCA suggestion for purchase of five machines by the Delhi Transport Department, it is submitted that at this initial stage, this court may consider the purchase of only one or two machines by the Delhi Transport Department and the same can be later increased gradually,"" the affidavit said. 
It said the number of devices can be increased once sufficient experience over a period of time is gained by the Delhi Transport Department and challenges in implementing the remote sensing in India, as pointed out in the ICAT study, are overcome.The transport department said it can issues tender for induction of remote sensing devices only after the specifications or standards are fixed by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) and machines certified accordingly are available.In a separate affidavit filed in the apex court, the MoRTH has said that considering the ""diversity and extensiveness"" of the country, the system of remote sensing programme for monitoring on-road emission of vehicles would be possible only on limited stretches. 
""The current programme of pollution check through the PUC centres for the vehicles in the idle condition is suitable and for the time being remains an essential part of the pollution management system,"" the MORTH said.The bench, which posted the matter for further hearing after two months, asked the MORTH to file a status report on the issue of remote sensing technology.On July 29, the top court had asked the MoRTH and Delhi Transport Department to respond to the EPCA's report on the use of remote sensing technology to help identify polluting vehicles.The amicus curiae had earlier told the top court that remote sensing technology would help in checking emission of particulate matter (PM) and other hazardous substances like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) from vehicles.The EPCA report has said that MoRTH needs to frame rules under the Central Motor Vehicle Act and define the scope and use of remote sensing programme for monitoring and enforcement of on-road emissions.
The report said that transport department of Delhi will be responsible for implementation of the programme in the city and once successful, transport departments of national capital region (NCR) districts can be directed to implement the same.It said that transport department of Delhi can issue global tender for procurement of remote sensing equipment and its operations.The issue of remote sensing technology has cropped up before the court when it was hearing a matter relating to air pollution in Delhi-NCR.",http://www.ptinews.com/news/10790240_Hearing-pollution-matters-regularly-so-that-people-can-get-clean-air--SC.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Public breastfeeding should be allowed. If you are allowed to smoke, drink, abuse in public, why not breastfeeding? It's the most beautiful and natural thing to do. All of us have done it at some point of time. Why shy away from it? A lot of importance is given to breastfeeding.""She went on and talked about fitness and weight loss. She said being fit is more important than weight loss as fitness and being healthy leads to weight loss. She also said how one should give time to the body to recover and how one should follow a balanced diet as well.What are your views on the same?

Payment terms are not adhered to and are easily violated for the slightest excuse without recourse to any easy dispute resolution,” said Somaraju, Treasurer, FHRAI.FHRAI also alleged that food aggregators have disconnected restaurants from its customers by the number masking of customers.“The food aggregators methods and practices are unbearable and require to be dealt with in the larger interest of the Hotel and Restaurant Industry,” added Kohli.Restaurants have also complained about the imposition of FSAs’ absurd food acceptance, food preparation, food collection time with penalties and a negative grading system.Meanwhile, requesting restaurant owners to stop the logout campaign, Zomato’s CEO and founder, Deepinder Goyal, in a series of tweets called for a collaborative discussion with internet aggregators.He also requested the restaurant industry to look for ways to reduce operating costs, so that eating out becomes more affordable for consumers. Acknowledging burden on restaurant partners, Goyal said that Zomato would be making modification in Zomato Gold and will do more for restaurant partners.Earlier on last Friday, Gurugram-based food delivery major had in a letter asked its Zomato Gold partner restaurants to serve notice before discontinuing service.A day before it, more than 300 restaurants in Gurugram in a protest against deep discounting pulled out from aggregators and table reservation services platforms such as Zomato, EazyDiner, Nearbuy, MagicPin and Gourmet Passport.NRAI, which represents 500,000 restaurants in the country, had jointly participated in the logout movement and threatened to do the same in other cities including Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru and Mumbai.",https://entrackr.com/2019/08/fhrai-calls-to-review-food-aggregators-contracts/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

There were demands that the driving license of Wafa Firoz, who was Sriram’s co-passenger when the accident took place, also be suspended.Speaking to TNM, Rajeev Puthalath, the Joint Transport Commissioner of Kerala, had stated that the department is following the law. “According to the law, we have to submit a notice to the accused persons and give them a period of 15 days to come up with an explanation, failing which their license will be cancelled,” explained Rajeev.According to the Transport Commissioner, although not directly, both the accused in the case were notified by the MVD about the 15-day period within which they must provide an explanation. “The deadline of 15 days concluded on Sunday and since they have not given any explanation, the MVD will move ahead with measures to cancel their driving license,” Rajeev said.Medical officers’ association protest police reportMeanwhile, the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) has lashed out at the police report which criticised the General Hospital doctor for not collecting the blood samples of the IAS officer immediately after the accident. According to the KGMOA, the police in their report have blamed Dr Rakesh Kumar of the Thiruvananthapuram General Hospital for the alleged delay in collecting the blood sample.Responding to this, OS Shyam Sundar, the President’s nominee of the KGMOA told Manorama News that the police are trying to hide their lapses by putting the blame on the doctor. “The General Hospital doctor has done everything that he was legally bound to do. And as far as the medical samples are concerned, the hospital needs a written request from the police, which was not given,” he said. The KGMOA has stated that they will submit a complaint to the Chief Minister of Kerala as well as to the Director-General of Police (DGP) regarding the report prepared by the police.Also read: What happened the night a journalist was mowed down by a car driven by an IAS officer",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/journalist-basheer-death-driving-licence-sriram-ias-suspended-year-107452?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The leading digital assistants were asked 800 questions each. Google Assistant was able to correctly answer 92.9% of the questions versus Siri at 83.1% and Alexa at 79.8%.,BGR India,"The war between smart digital assistants is certainly at its most intense. A new report now claims that Google Assistant has once again beaten Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri when it comes to answering queries correctly on smartphones.The claim is a part of an annual research test by venture capital firm Loup Ventures. The research team asked Assistant, Siri and Alexa 800 questions each. The firm found that Google’s virtual assistant understood every single query and answered correctly 92.9 percent of the time. In comparison, Siri answered correctly 83 percent of the time, and Alexa 80 percent.One candidate missing was Microsoft’s Cortana. The firm reportedly eliminated Cortana from its tests due to “Microsoft’s recent shift in Cortana’s strategic positioning.”The test used Siri on iOS 12.4, Google Assistant on a Pixel XL running Android 9 Pie, and Alexa via the iOS app. Google’s star performer understood all 800 queries. Siri, on the other hand, misunderstood two questions. Lastly, Alexa only misunderstood one.Google Assistant was the top performer in four of the five categories. But it fell short of Siri in the Command category again. “Siri continues to prove more useful with phone-related functions like calling, texting, emailing, calendar and music. Both Siri and Google Assistant far outperformed Alexa in the Command section,” the findings showed.Alexa lives on a third-party app. It can send voice messages and call other Alexa devices. But it cannot send text messages, emails, or initiate a phone call.The largest disparity was Google’s performance in the Commerce category. It correctly answered 92 percent vs Siri at 68 percent, and Alexa at 71 percent. Conventional wisdom suggests that Alexa would be best-suited for commerce questions. However, Google Assistant correctly answered more questions about product and service information and where to buy certain items.With Inputs from IANS",https://www.bgr.in/news/google-assistant-beats-amazons-alexa-apples-siri-on-smartphones/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It claims to process 60,000 orders daily, and more than half of the orders fulfilled include its private label products.Recently, the company organized its semi-annual Grand Orange Bag Days (GOBD) sale around the Independence Day clocking a revenue of Rs 115 crore by offering customers a 100% cashback on the products, selling roughly 1.3 crore product on the first day of the sale.Before the start of the sale, Grofers had hired around 5,000 employees to ramp up delivery and warehousing teams across 16 cities in the country. It claims to be on track to hit monthly GMV of Rs 550 crores fuelled by the increased demand due to the GOBD sale this month.Hat tip: paper.vc",https://entrackr.com/2019/08/grofers-70-mn-series-f-softbank-567-mn-valuation/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

4964,Iranian oil tanker seized by UK heads to Greece after release,"An Iranian oil tanker, seized by British Royal Marines last month, sailed through the Mediterranean toward Greece on Monday after it was released from detention off Gibraltar. The Grace 1, renamed the Adrian Darya 1, left anchorage off Gibraltar about 11 pm on Sunday. Iran has warned that any US move to seize the vessel again would have ""heavy consequences"".",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - An Iranian tanker at the center of an angry confrontation between Iran and Washington sailed for Greece on Monday after it was freed from detention off Gibraltar, as Washington called the release unfortunate and warned Greece and Mediterranean ports against helping the vessel. Tehran said any U.S. move to seize the vessel again would have “heavy consequences”. While Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif appeared to downplay the possibility of military conflict with Washington in an interview on U.S. television, he also indicated on a visit to Finland that Washington was seeking “more escalation”. The Grace 1, renamed the Adrian Darya 1, left anchorage off Gibraltar about 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Sunday. Refinitiv ship tracking data showed on Monday that the vessel was heading to Kalamata in Greece and was scheduled to arrive next Sunday at 0000 GMT. The seizure of the tanker by British Royal Marines near Gibraltar in July 4 on suspicion of carrying oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions led to a weeks-long confrontation between Tehran and the West. It also heightened tensions on international oil shipping routes through the Gulf. Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, lifted the detention order on Thursday. But the next day, a federal court in Washington issued a warrant for the seizure of the tanker, the oil it carries and nearly $1 million. Gibraltar said on Sunday it could not comply with that request because it was bound by EU law. Washington wanted to detain the tanker on the grounds that it had links to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which it has designated a terrorist organization. “It’s unfortunate that that happened,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News Channel about the ship’s release. Pompeo said that if Iran was successful in making a profit from the tanker’s oil cargo, IRGC elite forces would have “more money, more wealth, more resources to continue their terror campaign.”. A U.S. State Department official said Washington had conveyed its “strong position” to the Greek government, as well as to all ports in the Mediterranean about facilitating the tanker. The official said assisting the ship could be considered providing support to a terrorist organization. Zarif said in Finland: “We are happy this ordeal has ended and I hope this will lead to less escalation.” He also said the U.S. warrant had no legal basis and was politically motivated to “make more escalation.”    But in an interview with “NBC Nightly News,” Zarif said Iran would not take military action to end its standoff with its longtime adversary. “We will not. We have never done that, in the past 250 years. We have defended ourselves. And we have taught good lessons to those who invaded us,” Zarif said. He also appeared to downplay the possibility of U.S. military action against the Islamic Republic in the interview, saying the U.S. habit of saying: “No option is off the table” in its approach to Iran was a violation of the U.N. Charter. Greek authorities had no immediate comment on the situation. Asked whether the United States could renew its seizure request after the tanker sailed from Gibraltar, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said: “Such an action, and even the talk of it ... would endanger shipping safety in open seas.”  “Iran has issued the necessary warnings through official channels, especially the Swiss embassy, to American officials not to commit such an error because it would have heavy consequences,” Mousavi said in remarks on state television. Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran, which has no diplomatic relations with the United States. The Adrian Darya 1, which was reflagged to Iran after being delisted by Panama on May 29, was fully laden and carrying about 2 million barrels of oil, Refinitiv data showed. The cargo was valued at tens of millions of dollars.       U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in May last year, while the European Union is still part of the accord, which allows Tehran to sell its oil.  Washington wants to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero and has reimposed U.S. sanctions that place heavy penalties on any breaches even for non-U.S. citizens and companies, including asset freezes and being cut off from the U.S. financial system. While EU regulations still allow for companies and citizens in the bloc to trade with Iran, falling foul of U.S. sanctions has meant most banks are unwilling to process even authorized transactions such as for food and medicine, finance sources say. It is likely to be the first major foreign policy test for Greece’s new prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, since he took office in July if the vessel enters Greek territorial waters. Zarif said that because of U.S. sanctions, Iran could not disclose where the oil would go.  The Greek coastguard said it had no formal information the vessel was heading to Kalamata and was monitoring the matter.   Separately, a senior Iranian lawmaker said a crisis in Iran’s ties with Britain, which included Tehran’s seizure of a British-flagged tanker last month, would not be over until the tanker reached its destination. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on July 19 seized the Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz waterway for alleged marine violations, two weeks after the Grace 1 was commandeered. “Until the Iranian oil tanker arrives at its destination the British must help end the crisis,” Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, of parliament’s national security and foreign affairs committee, was quoted as saying by semi-official ISNA news agency. “The crisis with Britain is not over. Britain has the primary responsibility for ending the oil tanker crisis,” Falahatpisheh said. Mousavi said Tehran was waiting for a court decision on alleged maritime violations by the Stena Impero and he hoped the procedures would be completed as soon as possible.

4965,UK Queen's son denies any involvement in Epstein sex scandal,UK Queen Elizabeth II's son Prince Andrew has rejected any suggestion that he participated in alleged sex crimes which US financier Jeffrey Epstein was accused of. Epstein committed suicide in a US jail earlier this month. British media had published a picture which it said showed Andrew waving goodbye to a woman from inside a Manhattan mansion owned by Epstein.,Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince Andrew rejected any suggestion that he participated in the alleged sex crimes which U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein was accused of, Buckingham Palace said in a statement. Epstein committed suicide in a Manhattan jail cell earlier this month while being held on sex-trafficking charges. “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement.  “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behavior is abhorrent,” the Palace said. British media including the Daily Mail published a picture which it said showed Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth, waving goodbye to a woman from inside a Manhattan mansion owned by Epstein. The Mail said the picture had been taken in 2010 - two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state felony prostitution charge and registered as a sex offender. U.S. court papers have previously shown that Epstein had socialized with Andrew and other high-profile figures including U.S. President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton. Epstein first came under investigation in 2005 after police in Palm Beach, Florida, received reports he had sexually abused underage girls in his mansion there. By 2007, Epstein was facing a potential federal indictment for sexually abusing dozens of girls between 1999 and 2007. Epstein struck a deal, however, to plead guilty in 2008 to the Florida state felony prostitution charge, and register as a sex offender.

4966,10 blasts hit Afghanistan 2 days after suicide explosion killed 63,"At least 66 people were wounded in around 10 bomb blasts that hit Afghanistan's Jalalabad on Monday as the country marked the 100th anniversary of its independence, according to reports. No group claimed responsibility for the blasts. This comes two days after a suicide blast at a wedding hall in Kabul killed 63 people and wounded 182 others.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - A series of bombings struck restaurants and public squares on Monday in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, wounding at least 66 people, officials said, as the country marked the 100th anniversary of its independence. No group claimed responsibility for the 10 bombs but both Islamic State (IS) and the Taliban militants operate in the area. IS claimed responsibility for a weekend bomb attack on a wedding reception in the capital, Kabul, that killed 63 people  and wounded nearly 200. The Jalalabad bombs were planted near a market where hundreds of people had congregated after attending Independence Day events. Senior health official Fahim Bashari said at least 66 people were wounded, including 20 children enjoying the public holiday. Ghulam Mohammad, a shopkeeper selling plants, said his two sons and a nephew were among the injured in a blast at the market square. “Children insisted on being in the shop, as they wanted to celebrate Independence Day in the market, but they were seriously injured when a bomb exploded,” Mohammad said at a hospital in the city. Independence day ceremonies were disrupted in Mehtralam, the capital of the eastern province of Laghman, when militants hit a celebration venue with five rockets, officials said, adding that six civilians were injured. “The formal ceremony had ended,” said Assadullah Dawlatzai, a spokesman for the provincial governor. “People were being served lunch when the rockets landed. Unfortunately, six civilians were wounded.”  President Ashraf Ghani, in an Independence Day address in Kabul, called on the international community to stand with Afghanistan to eradicate the militants’ “nests”. “Our fight against the Daesh will continue,” he said, referring to IS. “The Taliban have laid the foundation for such brutal killings.” In the speech, Ghani did not refer to negotiations between the United States and the Taliban on a deal by which U.S. troops can withdraw in exchange for Taliban security guarantees. The United States also wants a Taliban commitment on power-sharing talks with Ghani’s government and a ceasefire. The Taliban have refused to talk to the government. But there are concerns among Afghan officials and U.S. national security aides about a U.S. withdrawal, with fears  Afghanistan could be plunged into a new civil war that could herald a return of Taliban rule and international militants, including Islamic State, finding a refuge. U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan before the 2020 presidential election. Trump on Sunday called the Kabul bomb attack horrible and expressed optimism about the talks. He said the United States would seek to get troop levels below 13,000 but leave behind “very significant” intelligence capabilities. The U.S. troops in Afghanistan train and advise Afghan security forces and conduct counterinsurgency operations.  The Taliban said in an Independence Day statement they looked forward to the departure of all foreign forces. “The day approaches closer when these invaders shall completely leave our country, akin to the British and Soviets before them,” they said. While never part of the British empire, Afghanistan gained complete independence from Britain on Aug. 19, 1919. Independence day ceremonies in Kabul were curtailed out of respect for those who died in the Saturday night bomb, the government said.

The idea was to tell an inspiring and extraordinary story,"" Balki told PTI. He said director Jagan Shakti, who has been his associate since Cheeni Kum, came up with the idea of the film. ""He has been living with this the idea of making a film on Mangalyaan for two years with five women. He developed many drafts but things never took off. He came to me and I said let me think about it. I did think it will be inspiring to do a story like this and we started work on it."" 
The noted filmmaker-writer said it was a bit difficult to simplify the process of a mission that is so complex in reality. ""It was challenging as a writer as I had to make a lot of scientific processes understandable by using analogies from everyday life and compare it to and weave it like a story. We also made sure it is not preachy, it is not like a documentary but is as an entertaining thriller."" One of the posters of Mission Mangal had Akshay on one side, while all the five women on another, courted controversy for giving a bigger space to the male protagonist. On this Balki said, ""Who is the hero of the film? Akshay Kumar. If I have Akshay Kumar as the hero of the film and how can I not put him on the poster? For intellectual reasons, it will be foolish to not have him on the poster.

The company was working on a modular smartwatch with a strap made of several modules, each with its own function.",Engadget,"Blocks' years-long quest to build a modular smartwatch has come to an unfortunate end.  The company has revealed (including through a private Kickstarter post) that it's liquidating assets after running out of cash.  The company had been looking for investors back in April 2018, but apparently didn't have much success.  Backers are receiving ""proof of debt"" forms, although we wouldn't count on getting money back.The shutdown isn't a complete shock.  Blocks unveiled its modular watch project back in 2014, and it blew past its May 2016 release target as it tweaked the design to reach a quality level it would accept.  Even by the standards of major tech companies, this was ambitious.  Blocks not only had to design the watch and multiple modules, but write a custom operating system (using Android underpinnings) to support the technology.  It needed a mountain of resources and time that it simply didn't have.This is unfortunately an all-too-familiar tune.  Modular mobile devices have long struggled to reach the market -- even Google axed its modular smartphone efforts in a bid to streamline its hardware strategy.  The hardware has long faced technical hurdles (such as ensuring compatibility), and that isn't even including the challenge of finding partners to create a module ecosystem.

He further said that India is a natural partner to help balance China.",The Financial Express,"Amid an increased India-Pak tension on Kashmir and an ongoing Afghan peace talks, a top American foreign policy expert has cautioned the Trump Administration against any strategic tilt towards Pakistan and moving away from India.“The US would be unwise to turn to Pakistan as a strategic partner,” Richard N Hass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in an op-ed last week. Pakistan sees a friendly government in Kabul as vital to its security and competition with arch-rival India, he wrote in his op-ed that was first published by Project Syndicate and thereafter, on the CFR website.Also read: Focus of Jammu and Kashmir police to isolate terrorists, not let them mislead people: DGP“There is little reason to believe that the military and intelligence services, which continue to run Pakistan, will rein in the Taliban or rule out terrorism,” Hass said. “Equally, the US would be unwise to alienate India. Yes, India has a tradition of protectionist trade policies and often frustrates US policymakers with its reluctance to cooperate fully on strategic issues,” he wrote. But democratic India, which will soon surpass China as the world’s most populous country and will boast the world’s fifth-largest economy, is a good long-term bet, he added.“It is a natural partner to help balance China. India has rejected participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, whereas Pakistan, struggling economically, has embraced it,” Hass said. According to the top American scholar, the US would also be unwise to race for the exits from Afghanistan.Peace talks with the Taliban mostly look like a means to extract US forces from the country, he claimed, adding that the process is reminiscent of Vietnam, where a 1973 agreement between the US and North Vietnam provided a pretext for American withdrawal from the South but not a basis for peace.The notion of a coalition government, with power shared by the current government and the Taliban, is optimistic at best, fanciful at worst, Hass observed. “Instead of embracing fantasy, the US should continue to keep a modest number of troops in Afghanistan to ensure the government survives and the country does not again become a terrorist haven. “What is required is an endurance strategy, not an exit strategy, based on local conditions, not political calendars. As has long been the case, south Asia is at best a region to be managed, not a problem to be solved,” he said.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

He added, ""The concept came up and...strategically it's interesting.""",Reuters,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Greenland is not for sale and the idea of selling it to the United States is absurd, Denmark’s prime minister said on Sunday after an economic adviser to President Donald Trump confirmed the U.S. interest in buying the world’s largest island. “Greenland is not for sale. Greenland is not Danish. Greenland belongs to Greenland. I strongly hope that this is not meant seriously,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told the newspaper Sermitsiaq during a visit to Greenland. Trump confirmed to reporters on Sunday that he had recently discussed the possibility, though he said such a move was not an immediate priority. “The concept came up and ...strategically it’s interesting,” Trump told reporters from the tarmac in Morristown, New Jersey, as he prepared to board Air Force One. “It is not No.1 on the burner; I can tell you that.” Trump is due to visit Copenhagen early next month, when the Arctic will be on the agenda in meetings with Frederiksen and Prime Minister Kim Kielsen of Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday initially confirmed media reports earlier in the week that Trump had privately discussed with his advisers the idea of buying Greenland. “I don’t want to predict an outcome. I’m just saying the president, who knows a thing or two about buying real estate, wants to take a look at a Greenland purchase,” Kudlow told Fox News. Kudlow said the situation was “developing” and noted that U.S. President Harry Truman also had wanted to buy Greenland. “And Denmark owns Greenland, Denmark is an ally, Greenland is a strategic place, up there. And they’ve got a lot of valuable minerals,” Kudlow added. A defense treaty between Denmark and the United States dating back to 1951 gives the U.S. military rights over the Thule Air Base in northern Greenland. Greenland, located between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, is dependent on Danish economic support. It handles its own domestic affairs while Copenhagen looks after defense and foreign policy. “It’s an absurd discussion, and Kim Kielsen has of course made it clear that Greenland is not for sale. That’s where the conversation ends,” Frederiksen told the Danish broadcaster DR. On Friday, Greenland’s foreign minister, Ane Lone Bagger, had told Reuters: “We are open for business, but we’re not for sale.”  Reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen; additional reporting by Sarah N.

It further went on to say that Pakistan, when it comes to Kashmir, has always ‘put an axe on its own foot’ and had been ‘crushed’ in the UNSC.It added that Pakistan can see it is failing to gather any support on Kashmir and is hence ‘frustrated’ and resorting to ‘false threats’.

The actor said a person can have multiple identities but there is a problem in the way being religious is interpreted today.""I think there is a problem with the way religion is being interpreted today. I know a lot of people who are shying away from calling themselves religious and I am one of them. I have always felt like I don't want to say I'm religious. I always call myself spiritual,"" the actor told PTI in an interview.""Religious has become or obtained a negative connotation because being religious has become synonymous with being intolerant. But they don't have to be divorced,"" Viday said adding that Tara Shinde, her character in the film, believes in a power beyond science.The actor also spoke about the increase in ""you versus me"" debate, which she believes, has led to the dilution in the concept of ""us"". ""Not just in our country but world over, it is becoming 'you' vs 'me'. That feeling of 'us' has been diluted lately. I wonder why though? Does it have to do with fewer resources or access to fewer resources and therefore wanting to hold it and then finding groups to align it with religion or some language or region or race or something like that... I don't know,"" the actor said.""We need to question ourselves over how open-minded we are. This is also a world, where freedom, I think means that I want to be free but I want to control you. That, to me, is not freedom... Everyone is screaming out loud. There are some blatant wrong things that are angering but look at what happens on Twitter. Everyone is taking offence to what is being said.""The film, released on Independence Day, features an ensemble cast including Vidya, Akshay Kumar, Taapsee Pannu, Sonakshi Sinha, Nithya Menon and Kirti Kulhari. Vidya said her character brings her own set of tricks as a homemaker in the professional space. She relied on the research done by director Jagan Shakti to play her part.""I spoke to director Jagan Shakti's sister, who works in ISRO. For me, it was important to understand how she strikes a balance between being a scientist, an extremely demanding job, and at the same time being a homemaker. ""Jagan met hundreds of scientists and I think he got all the requisite information about the mission. And then (R) Balki, Jagan and the team interpreted the theory the mission was based on.""

Labuschagne replaced Steve Smith, who has been ruled out of the Lord's Test following a delayed concussion after being hit on neck by a 148-kmph bouncer by England pacer Jofra Archer. Concussion substitute rule came into effect in international cricket on August 1.",Cricket Australia,"Steve Smith is in doubt for next week's third Ashes Test after being ruled out with concussion and replaced by Marnus Labuschange for the final day of the second Test at Lord's.Smith suffered a delayed concussion response to the blow on the back of the neck by a rapid Jofra Archer bouncer after lunch on Saturday.The 30-year-old passed a series of concussion tests after the incident and was cleared to resume his innings, but woke up on Sunday morning with a ""bit of a headache and a feeling of grogginess"".Smith was re-tested for concussion and his condition was found to have deteriorated, which is in line with the symptoms Smith reported.   Match referee Ranjan Madugalle approved Australia's application for a substitute under recently-introduced concussion rules, meaning Labuschagne can bat and bowl in the ongoing Test.It's the first time a concussion sub has ever come into a Test match.Smith will undergo a precautionary scan on his neck on Sunday, but is now in serious doubt for the third Test at Headingley, which starts on Thursday.The ICC's playing conditions for the new World Test Championship were recently tweaked to allow players who suffer concussions during a match to be replaced in their team’s XI.The regulations give the power to match referees to approve whether a nominated substitute is a 'like-for-like' replacement for the concussed player.Under the terms of Cricket Australia's concussion protocol, team doctor Richard Saw will have the final say in determining whether Smith can return to play.Per CA's concussion policy, Smith must not play or train until clearance has been provided by the doctor and he'll be prevented from any cricket activity for at least 24 hours after the diagnosis.After the initial 24 hours, Smith may gradually return to physical activity if he gets the doctor's clearance.CA's concussion protocol firmly states the decision to clear a concussed player must not be influenced by any coach, administrator, support staff, or the player themselves.Where a delayed concussion has been diagnosed, as is the case with Smith, he must pass two concussion Tests – the SCAT5 (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool) and CogSport tests - before being cleared to train and play.The non-computerised SCAT5 test requires Smith to answer a series of questions and fill out forms, while the computerised CogSport test compares a baseline assessment taken in the off-season to the test at time of injury.Smith passed both those tests in the team dressing room at Lord's after retiring hurt following the blow to his neck, and was cleared to resume his innings before eventually being dismissed for 92.He then faced fresh tests at Lord's on the morning of the fifth day when the concussion was diagnosed.2019 Qantas Ashes Tour of EnglandAustralia squad: Tim Paine (c), Cameron Bancroft, Pat Cummins, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Michael Neser, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner.England squad: Joe Root (c), Jofra Archer, Jonny Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Sam Curran, Joe Denly, Jack Leach, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes (vc), Chris Woakes.First Test: Australia beat England by 251 runs at EdgbastonSecond Test: August 14-18,Lord'sThird Test: August 22-26, HeadingleyTour match: Australians v Derbyshire, August 29-31Fourth Test: September 4-8, Old TraffordFifth Test: September 12-16, The Oval",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/steve-smith-concussion-substitute-marnus-labuschagne-lords-ashes-world-test-championship/2019-08-18?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Abhishek Mukherjee looks back at what can be called a hat-trick of appeals in a First-Class match.It was one of those dull Northampton days. The turnaround at Wantage Road was low. To make things worse, visiting captain Ed Joyce won the toss and opted to bat. After a brisk start, Ben Hutton and Owais Shah slowed things down.

Simon Cook, that giant of a fast bowler who used to share new ball with Angus Fraser for Middlesex, was not the same threat following shin splints and a stress fracture.Bowling at him was the fast bowler Johann Louw, Northamptonshire’s perseverant South African import who would later play for his country in 2008.The pair had put on 31. The Middlesex innings was going nowhere. Then it happened.Appeal, appeal, appeal…Louw hit Cook on the pad. The ball flew to Graeme Swann at slip. The Northants fielders went up in unison, but David Constant turned the LBW appeal down. Meanwhile, since Swann had the ball, it was not dead, and he noticed Cook was outside the crease. Swann threw the stumps down.The fielders turned to leg-umpire Peter Willey. Northamptonshire captain David Sales, meanwhile, walked up to Constant to find out why he had said no to the appeal. “He nicked it,” came Constant’s response.“In that case, we’re appealing for the catch,” was the prompt response. However, there was a catch (no pun intended): was the catch taken cleanly?After a conference with Willey, Constant gave Cook out caught, not LBW or run out.The Guardian later reported (and rightly so): “A sparse Wantage Road crowd needed something to justify their decision to opt for live cricket over televised badminton after enduring a painfully scratchy innings from Ed Joyce.”They did get their fill.What followed?Middlesex folded for 345, with Louw taking 4 for 110. Usman Afzaal scored a gutsy 111, but the hosts were reduced to 185 for 7 before Louw walked out and threw his bat around. He smashed 63 in 84 balls to take Northamptonshire to 295.Shah scored a quick hundred as Middlesex set Northants a target of 267. Louw, perhaps still pumped up by the triple-appeal, had his third good performance of the match, taking 5 for 44 as Middlesex lost only 6 wickets.Timothy Roberts scored 46 in response, but the hosts kept on losing wickets. Sales himself rose to the occasion and played out time. Afzaal, batting at No. 8, hung on doggedly; in the end Sales remained unbeaten on 73 as Northamptonshire finished on 155 for 7.Brief scores:Middlesex 345 (Ben Hutton 100, Owais Shah 62, Paul Weekes 44; Johann Louw 4 for 110) and 216 for 6 decl. (Owais Shah 100, Paul Weekes 51; Johann Louw 5 for 44) drew with Northamptonshire 295 (Usman Afzaal 111, David Sales 57, Johann Louw 63; Nantie Hayward 4 for 62) and 155 for 7 (Timothy Roberts 46, David Sales 73*).(Abhishek Mukherjee is the Chief Editor at CricketCountry and CricLife.

5036,1st ever concussion sub was also 1st offender of fake fielding rule,"All-rounder Marnus Labuschagne, who on Sunday became the first-ever concussion substitute in international cricket, was also the first offender of fake fielding rule. Playing for Queensland in 2017, Labuschagne faked a throw during a domestic one-day match after which the opposition were awarded five penalty runs. The 25-year-old was Smith's like-for-like replacement in the Lord's Test today.",Cricket Australia,"Steve Smith is in doubt for next week's third Ashes Test after being ruled out with concussion and replaced by Marnus Labuschange for the final day of the second Test at Lord's.Smith suffered a delayed concussion response to the blow on the back of the neck by a rapid Jofra Archer bouncer after lunch on Saturday.The 30-year-old passed a series of concussion tests after the incident and was cleared to resume his innings, but woke up on Sunday morning with a ""bit of a headache and a feeling of grogginess"".Smith was re-tested for concussion and his condition was found to have deteriorated, which is in line with the symptoms Smith reported.   Match referee Ranjan Madugalle approved Australia's application for a substitute under recently-introduced concussion rules, meaning Labuschagne can bat and bowl in the ongoing Test.It's the first time a concussion sub has ever come into a Test match.Smith will undergo a precautionary scan on his neck on Sunday, but is now in serious doubt for the third Test at Headingley, which starts on Thursday.The ICC's playing conditions for the new World Test Championship were recently tweaked to allow players who suffer concussions during a match to be replaced in their team’s XI.The regulations give the power to match referees to approve whether a nominated substitute is a 'like-for-like' replacement for the concussed player.Under the terms of Cricket Australia's concussion protocol, team doctor Richard Saw will have the final say in determining whether Smith can return to play.Per CA's concussion policy, Smith must not play or train until clearance has been provided by the doctor and he'll be prevented from any cricket activity for at least 24 hours after the diagnosis.After the initial 24 hours, Smith may gradually return to physical activity if he gets the doctor's clearance.CA's concussion protocol firmly states the decision to clear a concussed player must not be influenced by any coach, administrator, support staff, or the player themselves.Where a delayed concussion has been diagnosed, as is the case with Smith, he must pass two concussion Tests – the SCAT5 (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool) and CogSport tests - before being cleared to train and play.The non-computerised SCAT5 test requires Smith to answer a series of questions and fill out forms, while the computerised CogSport test compares a baseline assessment taken in the off-season to the test at time of injury.Smith passed both those tests in the team dressing room at Lord's after retiring hurt following the blow to his neck, and was cleared to resume his innings before eventually being dismissed for 92.He then faced fresh tests at Lord's on the morning of the fifth day when the concussion was diagnosed.2019 Qantas Ashes Tour of EnglandAustralia squad: Tim Paine (c), Cameron Bancroft, Pat Cummins, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Michael Neser, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner.England squad: Joe Root (c), Jofra Archer, Jonny Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Sam Curran, Joe Denly, Jack Leach, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes (vc), Chris Woakes.First Test: Australia beat England by 251 runs at EdgbastonSecond Test: August 14-18,Lord'sThird Test: August 22-26, HeadingleyTour match: Australians v Derbyshire, August 29-31Fourth Test: September 4-8, Old TraffordFifth Test: September 12-16, The Oval",https://www.cricket.com.au/news/steve-smith-concussion-substitute-marnus-labuschagne-lords-ashes-world-test-championship/2019-08-18?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The state’s Congress government, however, decided to appeal against the verdict and is likely to move the Rajasthan High Court. It has also constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the case afresh.The move has given Pehlu Khan’s family a renewed hope of justice. They appreciated the government’s decision to set up the SIT but are determined to appeal against the verdict before the Rajasthan High Court.Pehlu Khan, a cattle trader, was beaten to death allegedly by self-proclaimed cow vigilantes on suspicion of cow smuggling in Alwar, in April 2017. The deadly assault was caught on camera, however, as it turned out, it was not enough to ensure justice.Earlier this month, Rajasthan became the second state after Manipur to have an anti-mob lynching law after the state Assembly passed the The Rajasthan Protection from Lynching Bill, 2019.",https://www.india.com/news/india/justice-chandrachud-rues-alwar-lynching-verdict-3748458/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

PM Boris Johnson has repeatedly vowed to leave the bloc without a deal. Earlier this week, the US said it would enthusiastically support a no-deal Brexit if that is what the British government decides to do.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will face shortages of fuel, food and medicine if it leaves the European Union without a transition deal, according to leaked official documents reported by the Sunday Times whose interpretation was immediately contested by ministers.  Setting out a vision of jammed ports, public protests and widespread disruption, the paper said the forecasts compiled by the Cabinet Office set out the most likely aftershocks of a no-deal Brexit rather than the worst-case scenarios.  But Michael Gove, the minister in charge of coordinating “no-deal” preparations, challenged that interpretation, saying the documents did set out a worst-case scenario and that planning had been accelerated in the last three weeks. The Times said up to 85% of lorries using the main Channel crossings may not be ready for French customs, meaning disruption at ports would potentially last up to three months before the flow of traffic improved.      The government also believes a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, will be likely as plans to avoid widespread checks will prove unsustainable, the Times said.   “Compiled this month by the Cabinet Office under the codename Operation Yellowhammer, the dossier offers a rare glimpse into the covert planning being carried out by the government to avert a catastrophic collapse in the nation’s infrastructure,” the Times reported.   Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office said it did not comment on leaked documents. But Gove said it was an old document that did not reflect current preparedness. “It is the case, as everyone knows, that if we do have a no-deal exit there will inevitably be some disruption, some bumps in the road. That’s why we want a deal,” Gove told reporters. “But it is also the case that the UK government is far more prepared now than it was in the past, and it’s also important for people to recognise that what’s being described in these documents... is emphatically a worst-case scenario,” Gove added. A government source blamed the leak on an unnamed former minister who wanted to influence negotiations with the EU. “This document is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available,” said the source, who declined to be named. “It has been deliberately leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders.”  The United Kingdom is heading towards a constitutional crisis and a showdown with the EU as Johnson has repeatedly vowed to leave the bloc on Oct. 31 without a deal unless it agrees to renegotiate the Brexit divorce. Yet after more than three years of Brexit dominating EU affairs, the bloc has repeatedly refused to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said on Twitter he had signed a piece of legislation which set in stone the repeal of the 1972 European Communities act - the laws which made Britain a member of the organisation now known as the EU. Though his move was largely procedural, in line with previously approved laws, Barclay said in a statement: “This is a clear signal to the people of this country that there is no turning back (from Brexit).” A group of more than 100 lawmakers wrote to Johnson calling for an emergency recall of parliament to discuss the situation. “We face a national emergency, and parliament must now be recalled in August and sit permanently until October 31 so that the voices of the people can be heard, and that there can be proper scrutiny of your government,” the letter said.  Johnson will this week tell French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel that the Westminster parliament cannot stop Brexit and a new deal must be agreed if Britain is to avoid leaving the EU without one. Merkel said during a panel discussion at the Chancellery: “We are prepared for any outcome, we can say that, even if we do not get an agreement. But at all events I will make an effort to find solutions - up until the last day of negotiations.” Johnson is coming under pressure from politicians across the political spectrum to prevent a disorderly departure, with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn vowing to bring down Johnson’s government to delay Brexit. It is, however, unclear if lawmakers have the unity or power to use the British parliament to prevent a no-deal departure, likely to be the UK’s most significant foreign policy move since World War Two.

5061,Australia cricket union criticises fans for booing injured Steve Smith,"The Australian Cricketers' Association has criticised fans at Lord's for booing Australia batsman Steve Smith after he was felled by a bouncer from England fast bowler Jofra Archer, saying the sport deserves better. ""What we witnessed was bravery from an outstanding young man. It should be commended not vilified,"" it said. ""ItÂ’s time to call 'enough',"" the statement further read.",Times Now,"Australia's cricket union Sunday slammed fans at Lord's for booing Steve Smith after he was felled by a bouncer from fast bowler Jofra Archer, saying the sport deserves better.The star batsman collapsed face forward after a sickening blow to the side of the neck and head when on 80 during Australia's first innings of the second Ashes Test against England on Saturday.He was eventually able to walk off the field for concussion checks to a standing ovation after another gritty performance.But when he returned some fans booed him, mirroring the treatment he has received from sections of the crowd in England keen to remind him of his 12-month ban for ball-tampering.The Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA), which represents players, said it was wrong to hurl abuse at an injured player.""Cricket deserves much better than that. And Lord's, the home of cricket, deserves much better than that also,"" president Greg Dyer and chief executive Alistair Nicholson said in a joint statement.""What we witnessed was bravery from an outstanding young man. It should be commended not vilified.""Over the English summer, generally the crowds have been terrific and really added to the contest. But when someone is hurt, yet the boos continue, it's time to call 'enough'.""Several former Australian greats also condemned the behaviour with Ian Healy calling it ""disgusting"" while Mark Taylor said it was ""very disappointing"".While angry at Smith's treatment by some fans, the ACA applauded the decision by medics to insist the 30-year-old leave the field for concussion checks, a protocol pushed by Australia following the death of Phillip Hughes in 2014.Hughes, a former team-mate of Smith's, died after being hit by a bouncer in a domestic Sheffield Shield match in Sydney.""The events at Lord's show the importance of the concussion protocols which have been developed in Australia over the last few years,"" it said.""Administrators in Australia working with the ACA and now the ICC have done a good job in putting the protocols in place. Plainly, they are necessary to protect the players who are struck.""Let's remind ourselves -- this is a workplace for these players,"" it added. ""The reality is that cricket can be a dangerous sport, especially when the bowling is as ferocious as it has been in this series.""To see the protocols practised at Lord's overnight was important and correct.""While Smith was wearing a helmet it did not have the additional neck protection that was introduced after Hughes died, which remains optional.Australia coach Justin Langer said after Saturday's scare that he can see a time when it becomes mandatory.",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/australia-cricket-union-condemns-boos-after-steve-smith-felled-by-jofra-archer/470978?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5062,Wouldn't be surprised if neck guard becomes mandatory: Justin Langer,"Australia head coach Justin Langer has said he wouldn't be surprised if wearing a neck guard becomes mandatory in the future for batsmen. His remark comes after Steve Smith was felled after being hit on the neck by a bouncer from Jofra Archer in the second Ashes Test. ""You never like seeing your players get hit like that,"" he added.",Cricket Country,"Australia coach Justin Langer said there may come a time when Steve Smith has to wear a neck guard on his helmet whether he likes it or not after the star batsman was felled by a bouncer in the second Ashes Test against England at Lord’s on Saturday.ASHES 2019 FULL SCHEDULE | ASHES 2019 LATEST NEWSSmith had made 80 on the fourth day when he was struck by a short ball from fast bowler Jofra Archer, timed at 92.4 mph (148.7 kph), on an unprotected part of his neck.READ: Smith suffers sickening blow to head from Archer bouncerSmith, who fell to the ground, retired hurt after receiving onfield treatment. But after just 46 minutes away, he returned at the fall of the next wicket before he was lbw to Chris Woakes for 92.That dismissal denied Smith his third hundred in as many Ashes innings after he marked his comeback Test following a 12-month ball-tampering ban, with scores of 144 and 142 in Australia’s 251-run win at Edgbaston.Significantly, Smith was wearing a helmet without the additional stem guard neck protection introduced following the death of Phillip Hughes after his former Australia team-mate was hit by a bouncer in a 2014 domestic Sheffield Shield match in Sydney.“He (Smith) just doesn’t feel right (wearing a stem guard),” said Langer. “I know they came in after the tragedy of Hughesy. He might rethink it now after seeing what happened today, but you’d have to ask him that. At the moment, the players have a choice and I wouldn’t be surprised if they become mandatory in the future.”Former Australia batsman Langer was hit on the head several times during his Test career, including on debut by the West Indies’ Ian Bishop at Adelaide in 1993.But the 48-year-old was confident Saturday’s blow would not do lasting damage to Smith’s confidence against fast bowling. “When you get hit, it’s always in the back of your mind,” said Langer. “Any batsman who tells you it’s not is a liar. But he (Smith) is also the sort of person who will do everything from now until the next time he bats — whether it’s mentally, visualising or practising — to be right.”This series has seen the introduction of concussion substitutes, who can replace a batsman who has a severe head or neck injury. But Langer insisted Australia had not taken an undue risk in allowing Smith to resume his innings.“He passed all the testing and that’s why he came back out,” he said. “These are like my sons alright, so you’re never going to put them in harm’s way, even though you’re always in harm’s way with Test cricket. What else do you do? The medicos cleared him, he wanted to get out there.”‘Outstanding Archer’Before this match, Langer said Australia would look to test Test debutant Archer’s resilience. The World Cup winner, in for the injured James Anderson, rarely let up, however, during a fine return of of 2-59 in 29 overs.“I’ve got massive admiration for Jofra,” Langer said. “But I did say, like all bowlers, Test cricket is really hard. His endurance was outstanding today, his skill, his pace…To be able to bowl 29 overs today, what a great effort. Time will tell whether that has an impact.”Smith’s 92 helped Australia close to within eight runs of England’s first-innings 258. Australia quick Pat Cummins then took two wickets in two balls, including dismissing England captain Joe Root for a golden duck.At stumps, England were 96/4, a lead of just 104 runs.Australia could yet now force a win that would put them 2-0 up with three to play even though five sessions in the match have been washed out.“My thoughts are this is why we love Test cricket so much,” said Langer. “We’ve lost a couple of days -– or nearly a couple of days –- to rain and it’s absolutely game on tomorrow.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/the-ashes-2019-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-neck-guard-become-mandatory-in-future-justin-langer-881062?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Apple previously offered a ceramic Apple Watch, alongside Series 2 and Series 3 models.",TechCrunch,"Apple’s  next Apple Watch revision could include new materials for the case, including titanium and ceramic. That’s according to new assets pulled form the latest watchOS beta release, as uncovered by Brazilian site iHelp.br (via 9to5Mac). The new screens discovered in the beta show graphics used to pair the Apple Watch during setup, and list “Titanium Case” and “Ceramic Case” alongside model size identification info.Apple has previously offered a ceramic Apple Watch, alongside its Series 2 and Series 3 models, with a premium price and white and black case options. The company hasn’t previously used titanium, but the lightweight, durable metal is popular among traditional watchmakers because it can really significantly reduce the heft of a watch case, while still providing a premium look and feel.Last year’s Apple Watch Series 4 was the first significant change in body design for the wearable since its introduction in 2015, so it seems unlikely that Apple will change that this year again. The new physical design includes larger case sizes (40mm and 44mm, respectively, vs. 38mm and 42mm for previous generations), a thinner profile and a display with rounded corners and slimmer bezels.Offering new materials is a way for Apple to deliver new hardware that is observably new on the outside, in addition to whatever processor and component improvements they make on the inside. Apple will likely also offer these alongside their stainless steel and aluminum models, should they actually be released this fall, and would probably charge a premium for these material options, too.The Series 4 Apple Watch proved a serious improvement in terms of performance, and added features like the onboard ECG. Splashy new looks likely won’t be the extent of what Apple has planned for Series 5, however, especially since the company is revamping watchOS to be much more independent of the phone, which would benefit from more capable processors.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/17/next-apple-watch-could-include-new-ceramic-and-titanium-models/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5064,Engineer.ai exaggerates AI capabilities to attract investors: WSJ,"The Wall Street Journal has claimed that Gurugram and US-based technology startup Engineer.ai ""exaggerates its Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities to attract customers and investors."" It said Engineer.ai doesn't use AI to assemble code for apps, and instead uses human engineers in India and elsewhere for its app. ""We didn't exaggerate our technology,"" CEO Sachin Dev Duggal wrote in a blog.",Entrackr,"Anything or everything new to the human race is attractive whether it is new clothes, towns, movies, gadgets, jobs or technology.Moreover, sometimes as with everything new, it can be deceptive or sold to you by someone looking to cash in on hype around it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one such new thing, which startups are increasingly abusing to get funding and new users.Tech startup Engineer.ai, which claims to have built an artificial intelligence-assisted app development platform, is one such platform that has been alleged to exaggerate its AI capabilities.According to the Wall Street Journal report, the company does not use AI to assemble code for apps as it claims. The firm relying mostly on human engineers, while using the hype around AI to attract customers, it added.Last year in October, Los Angeles-based Engineer.ai raised $29.5 million from investors including Softbank-owned Deepcore.The report also claimed to have talked to the company’s former employees, who also said that the company is hyping its AI capabilities.According to Robert Holdheim, former CBO of Engineer.ai, the company is exaggerating its AI abilities to get the funding. Sachin Dev Duggal (Engineer.ai CEO) was telling investors that Engineer.ai was 80% done with developing a product that, in truth, he had barely even begun to develop, as per Holdeim, who also sued the company this year.However, Engineer.ai founder Duggal, in a response to Entrackr, denied the allegations made by the WSJ report.“We never said we use AI to assemble code. We said we use a Human-Assisted AI to run the end to end process. There are parts of this that are just non-ai based automation, some parts that are AI and some parts that are Human,” said Duggal, who started the company with building cloud operation in 2016 as Builder.The report is based on old employee account, who was not aware of what we had in tech stack, he added. On allegations by his former CBO, Duggal sharing platform approach slide presented to investors said we never said we have done 80% in terms of building our platform.The company also said that it has around 78 engineers currently working with Computer Science background, out of which 7% are working with its Intelligent Systems.Of late, the startups’ ecosystem has witnessed a phenomenal rise of AI-based startups. In reality, 7-8 out of 10 such startups companies are just using AI in their pitch to escalate chances of getting funded.Largely, because AI is also a bit complex and defined loosely, which makes it difficult for nonexperts to discern. As per a London venture capital firm, MMC survey, almost 40% of 2830 AI startups in Europe do not use AI.Despite this, funding is flowing in the sector.UPDATE: The news post has been updated with Engineer.ai response on Aug 20.

Unless there are such systems in Europe (deployed by Washington), we won’t do anything there,” he told the Rossiya-24 TV channel, according to Interfax news agency. The pact banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500-5,500 km), reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike at short notice.

Reportedly, the notices wouldn't be sent in the first instance when taxpayers miss any expenditure in their filings.",Times Now,"New Delhi: The income tax (I-T) department is planning to adopt 'non-threatnening' language that will ask taxpayers whether or not an expense has been accounted for instead of the intimidating officialese that specifies I-T sections under which a notice has been issued or sent. The notices wouldn't be sent by the tax authorities in the first instance to individuals and companies with queries related to expenditure or information that the taxpayer missed while filing income tax returns (ITR).The tax authorities are working on ways to ensure that the department makes information about large cash deposits or high-value transactions, available to the taxpayers on time for filing returns.The sources told the national publication that this can be done using tools like text messages to the taxpayers similar to the TDS (tax deducted at source) deposits. As far as reminders for filing returns are concerned, messages could be related to the transactions stating that they can be ignored if accounted for, as per the newspaper report.""We can tell people if TDS is due and if it has been deposited or not so that they can also take it up with the depositor,"" an official said.On Friday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey met income tax and indirect tax officers in Ahmedabad. Sitharaman said that a mindset change is needed to cater to an informed citizenry. Also, the use of technology and faceless assessment is the need of the hour in tax administration today.“There is no need for tax officials to visit the assessees. Instead, use technology to simplify the process so that repeatedly seeking information is not necessary. As far as assessees and their issues are concerned, we must communicate with them and solve issues by treating them respectfully,” she said.In order to make information on large property transactions, foreign exchange remittances and cash deposits and withdrawals available faster, some in the current processes and technology will be required. At present, information from property registration agencies flows after a certain lag and often a tax demand is raised after two years.It may be noted that the tax officials are advised to approach taxpayers only if they detect any major discrepancy or find concrete evidence. But even in that case, in the first instance, they should not issue a notice. The motive behind this is to give taxpayers time to rectify or correct their mistake, which may be due to oversight.In fact, the language of communication for filing and verification of the tax returns is proposed to be reviewed so that the I-T department doesn’t intimidate taxpayers. ""It will not just be faceless but randomised just like the way exam sheets are checked.

Which was fine by me, because my eyes were going a bit as it was, so I reckon I would have told them to get away in no uncertain terms anyway!""On Saturday, Steve Smith defied the England bowlers once again but he was stopped from scoring a third consecutive century in the series by debutant Archer, who regularly hit speeds north of 90mph on Day 4. Archer first hit Smith on the forearm before send a hurling a bouncer flush on the prolific run scorer's neck while he was on 80. It forced Smith to retire hurt and the Australians were visibly shaken by that, considering the similarity to the blow that the late Phillip Hughes received which eventually led to his death in 2014. But Smith was good enough to walk off and resumed his innings as soon as the next wicket fell. Ponting said that Smith won't be afraid the next time he comes out, considering that fact that he managed to push his total to 92 on Day 4 and that he is an experienced Test batsman. ""I don't think it'll be a series-defining spell,"" Ponting told cricket.com.au. ""He's made 92 again. I know he'd made 70 or so before he copped that first knock … and I wouldn't be surprised if they do attack him a bit more now.""But the one thing I like is that Archer didn't get Smith out. Smithy got through it without losing his wicket. Assuming everything is OK with that blow in the neck, he'll front up and do it all again in the second innings. (Smith coming back onto the ground) might seem incredibly courageous to the average person sitting back and watching it, but that's just what you're expected to do. That's part of the job of being a Test batsman.""He won't have any fear because it's just what you do every day. You face bowlers in the nets every day and you get hit every now and then. But certainly nothing changes in your mindset."" Langer had spoken about Smith's reluctance to wear a stem guard attachment to his helmet which would have softened the impact and Ponting said that he understands that. ""I understand why they would want to make it mandatory to wear it,"" said the batting great. ""But I also understand as a player that your helmet is such an individual piece of equipment. And obviously Smithy doesn't wear the stem guards because it's a comfort thing and he doesn't like the feeling around the back of his neck.""",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/jofra-archers-spell-reminds-me-of-2005-ricky-ponting/470980?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It all happened during Madrid's pre-season tour in the United States when it was reported that the Belgium starman arrived at the Santiago Bernabeu around 7kg overweight.It is obvious that players gain weight during the pre-season and are likely to return to their club camps, not in their footballer physique - something they never tend to carry throughout the season by indulging in gruelling training sessions. From Gonzalo Higuain to now Hazard, the internet spares no one and things are often get blown out of the proportion.(Photo: AP)Hazard had a similar case when his goal-scoring and breathtaking runs had gone for a toss during Madrid's pre-season tour in the United States. Since Hazard was Madrid's high-profile signing and long-time target it was expected from fans and internet warriors to make the playmaker their favourite target. A report even suggested that club president Florentino Perez has started to doubt Hazard's quality and he even fears that Belgium might not be a success story for Madrid. Just like he gets the better of defenders and goalkeepers by outsmarting them on the field, Hazard used his adroitness to shut down trollers once and for all. The 28-year-old forward missed the first La Liga game of Real this season after he sustained a thigh injury on the eve of Madrid's visit to Celta. Hazard, who joined the Los Merengues for a whopping 100 million euros from Chelsea was recently handed the famous No.7 jersey, previously worn by legendary footballers in the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raul Gonzalez and Emilio Butragueño. Coming to the support of the Belgian maestro, former teammate Cesc Fabregas suggested that criticism towards Hazard on being overweight shouldn't be a discussion at the first place. Though Fabregas was surprised by the criticism, he backed Hazard to lead the way for his new club.""I am surprised that (Hazard's) weight is discussed,"" Fabregas said..""It seems that people haven't watched him during his seven years in the Premier League.""Pre-seasons may be difficult for him and playing at Real Madrid is a big thing, but I have no doubts about him.

The number of those injured in Saturday's blast has risen to 182. Meanwhile, the Taliban militant group has denied responsibility for the blast.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility on Sunday for a suicide blast at a wedding reception in Afghanistan that killed 63 people, underlining the dangers the country faces even if the Taliban agrees to a pact with the United States. The Saturday night attack came as the Taliban and the United States try to negotiate an agreement on the withdrawal of U.S. forces in exchange for a Taliban commitment on security and peace talks with Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government. Islamic State fighters, who first appeared in Afghanistan in 2014 and have since made inroads in the east and north, are not involved in the talks. They are battling government and U.S.-led international forces and the Taliban. The U.S. special envoy for reconciliation in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said the attack showed the need to accelerate efforts to reach a deal with the Taliban, to help defeat Islamic State. U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday called the attack “horrible” and expressed optimism at the state of talks. He said the United States would seek to get troop levels below 13,000 but leave “very significant” intelligence capabilities behind. “We’re there for one reason, we don’t want that to be a laboratory, it can’t be a laboratory for terror,” Trump said, speaking before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey. About 14,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, training and advising Afghan security forces and conducting counterinsurgency operations. Islamic State has claimed some of the bloodiest attacks in Afghan cities over the past couple of years, with some aimed at the Shi’ite minority. The Sunni Muslim group, in a statement on the messaging website Telegram, claimed responsibility for the attack at a west Kabul wedding hall in a minority Shi’ite neighborhood, saying its bomber had been able to infiltrate the reception and detonate his explosives in the crowd of “infidels”. The Taliban earlier denied responsibility for the blast  and condemned it. More than 180 people were wounded, with many women and children among the casualties, interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said on Sunday as grieving families thronged to Kabul’s crowded cemeteries. “We want peace, not such brutal suicide attacks,” said Ahmad Khan, who was burying a relative. Pictures on social media from the scene of the blast showed bodies strewn amid overturned tables and chairs, with dark blood stains on the wedding hall carpet. Both the bride and groom survived. “I won’t ever be able to forget this, however much I try,” the groom, Mirwais Elmi, told the TOLOnews channel. He said his cousin and some friends had been killed. The bride’s father told TOLOnews that 14 members of his family were killed. Brightly lit wedding halls that line some suburban streets of the city had been targeted previously by bombers. At least 40 people were killed in a blast in November. There has been no let-up in fighting and bomb attacks in Afghanistan over recent months despite talks between the United States and the Taliban since late last year. President Ashraf Ghani, in comments on the Kabul blast before the Islamic State claim, said the Taliban could not “absolve themselves of blame for they provide a platform for terrorists”. Celebrations for Monday’s 100th anniversary of Afghanistan’s independence from Britain were curtailed out of respect for the blast victims, the president’s office said. The Taliban has been fighting to expel foreign forces and re-establish a theocratic Islamic state since its ousting in October 2001, weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. Both U.S. negotiators and the Taliban have reported progress after eight rounds of talks since late last year. Trump has made no secret of his desire for a U.S. pullout from Afghanistan and an end to America’s longest war.  But there are concerns among Afghan officials and U.S. national security aides that Afghanistan could be plunged into a new civil war that could herald a return of Taliban rule and international militants, including Islamic State, finding a refuge. Afghan government officials also fear that a Taliban pact could drive some die-hard Taliban fighters into the arms of Islamic State. Under the expected deal, the Taliban, in exchange for a U.S. commitment to withdraw, would guarantee that Afghanistan would not be a sanctuary for militants to expand and plot new attacks. The United States also wants a Taliban commitment to hold power-sharing talks with the government and announce a  ceasefire. The Taliban has refused to talk to the government. Khalilzad said the peace process had to be accelerated, in particular the intra-Afghan talks. “Success here will put Afghans in a much stronger position to defeat ISIS,” he tweeted, referring to Islamic State.

5093,"New pain-sensing organ discovered in skin, claim scientists","Sweden's Karolinska Institutet scientists have claimed to have found a new pain-sensing, meshlike organ in the skin that senses dangerous environmental stimuli. The organ is built from specialised glial 'Schwann' cells located below the skin's outer layer and is sufficient and required for initiation of mechanical pain transduction, researchers said. ""It's a two-cell receptor organ,"" they added.",ANI,"Washington D.C. [USA], Aug 16 (ANI): Researchers have discovered a new sensory organ that is able to detect painful mechanical damage such as pricks and impacts.Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have discovered this new sensory organ in the skin that is sensitive to hazardous environmental irritation. It is comprised of glia cells with multiple long protrusions and which collectively go to make up a mesh-like organ within the skin.According to the study published in the journal -- Science -- this organ is sensitive to painful mechanical damage such as pricks and pressure.The study described what the new pain-sensitive organ looks like, how it is organised together with pain-sensitive nerves in the skin and how activation of the organ results in electrical impulses in the nervous system that result in reflex reactions and experience of pain.Pain causes suffering and results in substantial costs for society. Almost one person in every five experiences constant pain and there is a considerable need to find new painkilling drugs.However, sensitivity to pain is also required for survival and it has a protective function. It prompts reflex reactions that prevent damage to tissue, such as pulling your hand away when you feel a jab from a sharp object or when you burn yourself.The cells that make up the organ are highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli, which explain how they can participate in the detection of painful pinpricks and pressure. In experiments, the researchers also blocked the organ and saw a resultant decreased ability to feel mechanical pain.""Our study shows that sensitivity to pain does not occur only in the skin's nerve fibers, but also in this recently-discovered pain-sensitive organ,"" said Patrik Ernfors, professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics and chief investigator for the study.

""If someone thinks martyring our leaders would stop us from our goal they're living in a fool's paradise,"" it added. There has been no claim of responsibility for the bomb blast.",Reuters,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan/KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan Taliban officials said on Saturday the killing of the brother of their leader in a bomb attack would not derail talks with the United States aimed at securing the withdrawal of U.S. troops after 18 years of war. There was no claim of responsibility for the bomb that killed the younger brother of Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada near the Pakistani city of Quetta on Friday. It came after both Taliban and U.S. officials have reported progress in talks on an agreement centered on a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in exchange for a Taliban security guarantee. “If someone thinks martyring our leaders would stop us from our goal they’re living in a fool’s paradise,” a Taliban leader said by telephone from an undisclosed location. “We are close to our goals,” he said, referring to the talks with the United States. He declined to be identified. The militants have been fighting to expel foreign forces and set up an Islamic state since they were ousted in October 2001, weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. Both U.S. negotiators and the Taliban have reported progress after eight rounds of talks since late last year but the violence has not eased. The bomb at the mosque near Quetta killed four people, and wounded 20, Pakistani police said. The Taliban leader’s brother, Hafiz Ahmadullah, was leading prayers when it exploded. One of the leader’s sons was wounded, Taliban officials said. Pakistani police confirmed that one of the dead was identified as Hafiz Ahmadullah but said they could not confirm if he was a brother of the Taliban leader. Pakistan denies accusations that it supports the Taliban but many members live there. In the Afghan capital, Kabul, a suicide bomber attacked a Saturday night wedding reception. An interior ministry spokesman said there were tens of casualties, both wounded and dead. There was no claim of responsibility. U.S. President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire for a U.S. pullout from Afghanistan and an end to America’s longest war. Top U.S. national security advisers briefed Trump on Friday on the negotiations. There are deep concerns among Afghan officials and U.S. national security aides about the talks led by U.S. special representative to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, who updated Trump. A U.S. pullout has raised fears Afghanistan could plunge into a new civil war that could see a return of Taliban rule and give international militants a sanctuary. Under the expected deal, the Taliban, in exchange for a U.S. commitment on a withdrawal, would guarantee Afghanistan would not be a sanctuary for militants to expand and plot new attacks, both sides have said. The Taliban are also expected to make a commitment to open power-sharing talks with the U.S.-backed government and agree to a ceasefire. Afghan presidential spokesman Sediq Seddiqi told a news briefing any deal had to include a ceasefire and a U.S. withdrawal would be based on conditions. A second Taliban official, speaking from Doha, where the Taliban have a political office and where the talks have been held, said preparations were being made for a meaningful final round. “We’ve solved most issues,” said the official, who also declined to be identified. No date has been set for more talks. The Taliban were considering a ceasefire in places from which U.S. forces withdraw, the second official said. Some 14,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, training and advising Afghan security forces and conducting counterinsurgency operations.

5097,May God ruin Trump: US lawmaker Tlaib's 90-year-old grandmother,"After US lawmaker Rashida Tlaib rejected Israel's offer to let her travel to the West Bank to visit her family on ""humanitarian grounds"", her 90-year-old grandmother said, ""Trump tells me I should be happy Rashida is not coming...May God ruin Trump."" Trump had tweeted, ""The only real winner here is Tlaib's grandmother. She doesn't have to see her now!""",Reuters,"BEIT UR AL-FAUQA, West Bank (Reuters) - Sitting under an olive tree in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Muftia Tlaib scoffs at the attention she has recently received from the president of the United States.     “May God ruin him,” she says.  Tlaib is the grandmother of U.S. congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, at the center of an affair that has drawn Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu together against U.S. Democrats. On Thursday, bowing to pressure from Trump, Israel barred a visit by Rashida Tlaib and fellow Democrat Ilhan Omar that it had initially said it would allow. The next day, Israel said it would let Tlaib visit her family in the West Bank on humanitarian grounds - but Tlaib rejected the offer, saying that Israel had imposed restrictions meant to humiliate her.. On Friday night, Trump tweeted:  “Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted, whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib’s grandmother. She doesn’t have to see her now!” Ninety-year-old Muftia Tlaib, sitting in her garden in the village of Beit Ur Al-Fauqa, was not impressed. “Trump tells me I should be happy Rashida is not coming,” she said. “May God ruin him.” Her son, Rashida’s uncle Bassam Tlaib, said the women had not seen each other since 2006: “She was going to slaughter a sheep when Rashida arrived and prepare her favorite food, stuffed vine leaves. “Rashida sees her granny as a second mother, she has always supported her. Rashida says she owes her success to her grandmother.” Tlaib did not outline what the conditions imposed on her visit were. Israeli media reported that she had agreed not to promote boycotts against Israel as part of her request to Israel’s Foreign Ministry. Tlaib, like Omar, has voiced support for the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, which opposes the occupation and Israel’s policies toward Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. BDS backers can be denied entry to Israel by law. The pair are the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress, and Detroit-born Tlaib is the first Palestinian-American congresswoman. Both are members of the Democratic party’s progressive wing and sharp critics of Trump and Israel. The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.  Israel has annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally; maintains a blockade of Gaza, run by the Islamist Hamas movement; and controls most of the West Bank, where Palestinians have limited self-rule. The prospects of resolving the conflict under the “two-state solution” that had guided peacemaking efforts for years have dimmed significantly since Trump took office, while Israeli settlements on land Palestinians seek for a state have expanded. The Trump administration, which is particularly close to the Netanyahu government, has touted its own peace plan but details remain vague. It fueled Palestinian anger by recognizing disputed Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017. Trump has for weeks been attacking Tlaib and Omar, along with lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts - all women of color known as the “Squad” - accusing them of hostility to Israel in a barrage condemned by critics as racist.  “Trump has told Rashida and Ilhan to go back to their home countries. What a contradiction, yesterday he asked them to leave and today he asks that they aren’t let in,” said Bassam Tlaib. Still, the grandmother is hopeful: “My heart tells me that she will come.”(The story is refiled to fix typo in paragraph nine.)

5098,Govt says probing jump in refined palm oil imports from Malaysia,"The Commerce Ministry said it has initiated a probe into whether a jump in refined palm oil shipments from Malaysia is causing serious injury to the domestic industry. Malaysian exports of refined palm oil to India jumped 727% in the first half of 2019 to 1.57 million tonnes, according to data compiled by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB).",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India has initiated a probe into whether a jump in refined palm oil shipments from Malaysia is causing serious injury to domestic industry, the trade ministry’s investigative arm said in a statement. Malaysian exports of refined palm oil to India, the world’s biggest importer of edible oils, jumped 727% in the first half of 2019 to 1.57 million tonnes compared with the same period a year before, according to data compiled by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB). Mohd Bakke Salleh, chairman of the MPOB, last month attributed the increase to recent changes in Indian duties. In January, New Delhi cut import duty on refined palm oil shipments to 50% from 54%. Malaysian shipments already attracted only a 45% duty due to the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement signed by the two countries nearly a decade ago.  Yet the change in duty structure reduced the effective duty difference between crude palm oil (CPO) and refined palm oil for Indian refiners to 5.5 percent from 11 percent for shipments from Malaysia, making overseas buying of refined palm oil more lucrative than CPO. Rising shipments of refined palm oil have hit local refiners, alleges Mumbai-based trade body the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA), which has filed an application with the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) for the investigation. “The Authority prima facie finds that there is sufficient evidence that imports of product under investigation have increased significantly causing serious injury to the domestic producers,” the DGTR said in a statement. The investigative agency has asked interested parties to submit their views within a month. The DGTR has in the past recommended the government raise duties on imports of certain products such as solar cells that were deemed to be hurting local industry.

5100,Male UFC fighter challenges female UFC fighter to a match,"UFC fighter Henry Cejudo has said that he wants to be the first UFC ""intergender"" champion and challenged female featherweight fighter Valentina Shevchenko to a match. Shevchenko responded to Cejudo, saying, ""Be careful what you wish for."" ""I don't even know how to respond to that,"" UFC President Dana White said about the challenge.",RT,"The very idea might sound like a sinister sporting sequel to ‘The Hunger Games’ set in a dystopian future where genders have finally gelled into an unrecognizable blur - much to the delight of social justice warriors.But it isn’t too far away from reality.Earlier this week Henry Cejudo, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bantamweight and featherweight titleholder, issued a callout to the organization’s female flyweight ruler Valentina Shevchenko for a fight to determine the world’s first 'intergender champion'.And why not? If the perennial debate about allowing transgender athletes to perform alongside women, regardless of obvious physical advantages and in spite of worrying anomalies, shows no sign of dying down, why not rip up the rulebook and allow a genderless free-for-all across all sports.While it sounds outlandish and maybe even cruel from Cejudo, his proposal perhaps might be a good thing for sports. The politically correct brigade have consistently campaigned for a complete bypass of factual biological contrasts between men and women to accommodate transgender athletes at the expense of the success of women so vehemently. Why not cut to the chase?Said brigade found it perfectly acceptable for Laurel Hubbard, the New Zealand weightlifter who set national records as a junior male before transitioning to female later in life, to win the gold medal in the 2017 Australian International & Australian Open. This was despite a backlash from fellow athletes who claimed Hubbard’s win was unjust.Only injury prevented the 41-year-old from winning Commonwealth Games gold last year, but this year Hubbard went on to win the 2019 Pacific Games and Oceania Championships, and will keep wiping the floor with competition as long as such glaringly apparent natural biological differences between men and women are controverted.However, when this denial is taken to the extreme and is applied to mixed martial arts, the stakes are gravely raised, and the outcomes would be dark and damning. Would it be ethically correct to allow a man to fight a woman with minimal rules? What if there was a death? And more importantly, why is it any different from allowing men to identify as women and compete alongside them?These questions have come perilously close to being answered in MMA in the case of transgender fighter Fallon Fox who, although having met all all conditions to compete among women, caused an outcry by breaking the skull of Tamikka Brents in a brutal TKO win.After the fight, Brents claimed that despite being an “abnormally strong female in my own right” she had “never felt so overpowered ever in my life” as against US Navy veteran Fox. Major UFC figures condemned Fox, with promotion head honcho Dana White stating: “I don't think someone who used to be a man and became a woman should be able to fight a woman” and then-poster girl Ronda Rousey claiming there was no “undo button” on male puberty.Those views have been held by other sports, notably by all-time tennis great Martina Navratilova. But even coming from the pinnacle of sport down, those claims mostly fall on deaf ears, as the Czech 18-time Grand Slam champion was forced to apologize when she dared to voice her opinion that to allow men to compete with women if they simply “change their name and take hormones” is “unfair.''Unfair might not cut it in MMA, where the logical conclusions and repercussions would be much more severe.On the other hand, should Shevchenko - who has preliminarily accepted the callout for an intergender match - win the fight, the merry band of politically correct fanatics would deem social justice to have been served, flinging open the floodgates for intersex competition across any discipline, maybe even scrapping weight classes and distances altogether in the name of progression.Intergender mixed martial arts fights may seem like stupidity and at best a crass attempt at self-promotion, but they could be closer than we think and if political correctness in sport is pushed to such illogical extremes, it could take a brutal show of force to finally remove any doubt about biological differences between genders.By Danny Armstrong",https://www.rt.com/sport/466649-intergender-mma-champions-debate/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

But he has a style of his own and one can’t complain about it as he has an average in excess of 60 in Test cricket.

5113,Google discloses it acquired app that solves equations from pics,"Google has disclosed it acquired US-based startup Socratic last year which offers an app that lets users solve algebraic equations by clicking a photo of the same. The app, to which Google has now added AI capabilities, has been relaunched on iOS with an Android update coming later this year. Socratic was founded by Shreyans Bhansali and Chris Pedregal.",TechCrunch,"Google publicly disclosed its acquisition of homework helper app Socratic in an announcement this week, detailing the added support for the company’s AI technology and its relaunch on iOS. The acquisition apparently flew under the radar — Google says it bought the app last year.According to one founder’s LinkedIn update, that was in March 2018. Google declined to comment when asked for specifics about the acquisition.Socratic was founded in 2013 by Chris Pedregal and Shreyans Bhansali with the goal of creating a community that made learning accessible to all students.Initially, the app offered a Quora-like Q&A platform where students could ask questions that were answered by experts. By the time Socratic raised $6 million in Series A funding back in 2015, its community had grown to around 500,000 students. The company later evolved to focus less on connecting users and more on utility.It included a feature to take a photo of a homework question in order to get instant explanations through the mobile app launched in 2015. This is similar to many other apps in the space, like Photomath, Mathway, DoYourMath and others.However, Socratic isn’t just a math helper — it can also tackle subjects like science, literature, social studies and more.In February 2018, Socratic announced it would remove the app’s social features. That June, the company said it was closing its Q&A website to user contributions. This decision was met with some backlash from disappointed users.Socratic explained the app and website were different products, and it was strategically choosing to focus on the former.“We, as anyone, are bound by the constraints of reality—you just can’t do everything—which means making decisions and tradeoffs where necessary. This one is particularly painful,” wrote Community Lead Becca McArthur at the time.That strategy, apparently, was to make Socratic a Google AI-powered product. According to Google’s blog post penned by Bhansali — now the engineering manager at Socratic — the updated iOS app uses AI technology to help users.The new version of the iOS app still allows you to snap a photo to get answers, or you can speak your question.For example, if a student takes a photo from a classroom handout or asks a question like “what’s the difference between distance and displacement?,” Socratic will return a top match, followed by explainers, a Q&A section and even related YouTube videos and web links. It’s almost like a custom search engine just for your homework questions.Google also says it has built and trained algorithms that can analyze the student’s question, then identify the underlying concepts in order to point users to these resources. For students who need even more help, the app can break down the concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand lessons.In addition, the app includes subject guides on more than 1,000 higher education and high school topics, developed with help from educators. The study guides can help students prepare for tests or just better learn a particular concept.“In building educational resources for teachers and students, we’ve spent a lot of time talking to them about challenges they face and how we can help,” writes Bhansali. “We’ve heard that students often get ‘stuck’ while studying. When they have questions in the classroom, a teacher can quickly clarify—but it’s frustrating for students who spend hours trying to find answers while studying on their own,” he says.This is where Socratic will help.That said, the acquisition could help Google in other ways, too. In addition to its primary focus as a homework helper, the acquisition could aid Google Assistant technology across platforms, as the virtual assistant could learn to answer more complex questions that Google’s Knowledge Graph didn’t already include.The relaunched, AI-powered version of Socratic by Google arrived on Thursday on iOS, where it also discloses through the app update text the app is now owned by Google.The Android version of the app will launch this fall.Updated, 8/16/19, 3:30 PM ET to note Google’s decline to comment.  ",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/google-discloses-its-acquisition-of-mobile-learning-app-socratic-as-it-relaunches-on-ios/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5115,Man trades 71 sheep for lover with her husband; his dad wants sheep back,"A man traded 71 sheep with his lover's husband in UP's Gorakhpur district after being directed by the village panchayat as a punishment for eloping with the woman. However, the man's father approached police seeking the sheep back. The man said his father doesn't have the right to demand the sheep back as they are under his ""right to inheritance"".",The New Indian Express,"LUCKNOW: It could well be called Gorakhpur's Affair of the Sheep.After learning that a man was living with the wife of another, the village panchayat ordered the lover to give away 71 sheep to the estranged husband. The order said this was to punish the man for eloping with the married woman.The woman, her lover and her husband were all quick to accept the decision of the panchayat. But there was to be a twist.Enter the father of the lover, Ram Naresh. He demanded his sheep back and even approached the cops for help.The case dates back to July 22. It was in Pipraich, a small town in Gorakhpur district, that the young woman eloped with her lover.  Her husband went to the police but even their intervention proved futile. The woman refused to return and insisted on living with her lover.Recently, the lover and the husband came face to face while grazing their cattle and soon a brawl broke out. Following this, a panchayat meeting was called where the lover was asked to make a choice between his herd of sheep and the woman. The man opted for the woman.At this, he was directed by the panchayat to give 71 of the 142 sheep his family owned to the husband of the woman he was living with. This led to the sequence of events that culminated in the lover's father demanding his sheep back as we had reported earlier.With the woman continuing to refuse to return to her husband and reiterating her decision to live with her lover instead, the matter now rests with the police.The father of the lover has, meanwhile, accused the panchayat of going against the law by allowing a woman to live with another man without her having obtained a divorce.The five wise men of the panchayat have now gone underground fearing police action.The young lover, who gave away 71 sheep to the husband of the woman he is living with, seems to be made of sterner material. He is busy insisting that the sheep are his under his right to inheritance and his father has no right to demand them back. He believes his father will soon come around and accept his relationship with the woman.According to SHO, Khorabar, Ambika Bhardwaj, the police authorities are making all efforts to resolve the matter by speaking to the parties involved.SSP Gorakhpur Dr Sunil Gupta, for his part, thinks it is imperative to find out who owned the sheep. If they were owned by Ram Naresh, then the woman’s husband will be asked to return the animals to him. ",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/aug/17/two-men-a-woman-and-71-sheep-up-love-triangle-leaves-cops-stumped-2020282.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5131,Pilots who landed plane in field get RussiaÂ’s highest medal,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday awarded Russia's highest medal, the Hero of Russia, to pilots Damir Yusupov and Georgy Murzin who landed a passenger plane in a field after its engines failed. The plane had to make an emergency landing on Thursday after birds disabled its engines. All the 233 passengers on board the plane survived the emergency landing.",The New Indian Express,"MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday awarded the nation's highest medal, the Hero of Russia, to the pilot who managed to smoothly land his disabled passenger plane in a cornfield after a flock of birds hit both engines and knocked them out.The experienced captain, 41-year-old Damir Yusupov, said Friday that a quick landing was his only chance and he was not afraid of handling it. He said he had hoped to circle the airport and land normally when one engine shut down due to the bird strike moments after taking off from Moscow's Zhukovsky Airport. But then his second engine cut off moments later, leaving him no choice.He landed his Ural Airlines A321 so gently in the head-high corn that just one of the 233 people on board was hospitalized.People all across Russian have hailed Yusupov as a hero — the accolades he said were embarrassing.""It feels odd and I'm shy,"" he said.Putin also awarded the Hero of Russia to the plane's second pilot, 23-year-old Georgy Murzin and bestowed other top awards on the plane's cabin crew.Yusupov's feat Thursday drew comparisons to the 2009 ""miracle on the Hudson,"" when Capt. Chesley Sullenberger safely ditched his plane in New York's Hudson River after a bird strike disabled its engines, saving the lives of all 155 people on board.""I didn't feel any fear,"" Yusupov told reporters in a televised interview from Yekaterinburg. ""I saw a cornfield ahead and hoped to make a reasonably soft landing. I tried to lower vertical speed to make the plane land as smoothly as possible and glide softly.""Yusupov hailed his cabin crew, who managed to evacuate the passengers. He also apologized to passengers for failing to get them to their destination — Simferopol in Crimea.""I wish a quick recovery to all those injured and I wish them not to be afraid of flying,"" he added.The Emergencies Ministry said 74 people asked for medical assistance after the landing. Health authorities said 23 people were taken to the hospital, but all but one was released following check-ups.The son of a helicopter pilot, Yusupov had worked as a lawyer before he changed course and joined a flight school when he was 32. He has flown with Ural Airlines since his graduation in 2013, logging over 3,000 flight hours. He became a captain last year.Bird strikes on planes occur regularly around the world, even though airports use bird distress signals, air cannons and other methods to chase them away from runways. Smaller birds are usually chopped up by a plane's turbine fan blades, but plane engines aren't designed to withstand strikes from multiple birds or larger birds.John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, said the bird-vs-engine problem has been under study for years, with no permanent fix available yet. He said a cornfield was a good place to land because it's free of big rocks and trees that could have damaged the plane.Some Russian officials suggested the flock of gulls that hit Yusupov's plane could have been attracted by an unauthorized garbage dump near the airport. Local authorities confirmed after checking that there are several dumpsites in the vicinity, including an unauthorized one. Numerous ponds and lakes are also located near Zhukovsky Airport, helping attract gulls.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/good-news/2019/aug/17/russia-honours-pilot-who-landed-engine-failed-aircraft-in-cornfield-with-highest-medal-2020260.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Apple was founded in the year 1976.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it was either directly or indirectly responsible for 2.4 million U.S. jobs, up 20% from the 2 million the technology company estimated in 2017. The iPhone maker said its direct workforce grew from 80,000 to 90,000 in the 2-1/2 years since its last U.S. job estimate. But most of the estimated growth came from companies such as Broadcom Inc which make parts in the United States for Apple products and from third-party software developers making apps for Apple devices. App-related jobs totaled 1.9 million, up by 325,000 from its previous estimate, the Cupertino, California-based company said in a news post on its website.

5143,Google removes 85 apps with adware downloaded 80 lakh times,"Google has removed 85 Android apps that were found infected with adware that served ads which took over users' screens. Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro revealed the 85 apps were collectively downloaded over 80 lakh times. ""Apart from displaying advertisements that are difficult to close, it employs unique techniques to evade detection through user behaviour and time-based triggers,"" the firm said.",Engadget,"Google has removed 85 apps from the Google Play store after security researchers at Trend Micro found a particularly annoying adware scheme hiding inside.The adware, called AndroidOS_Hidenad.HRXH, was embedded in fully functioning photography and gaming apps that were installed over 8 million times. The apps exploited common Android functions to detect when the user unlocked their phone, triggering ads that were typically five minutes in length and were difficult to skip. They would also replace their icons on the home screen with a shortcut so that even if the user dragged what they thought was the app into the trash, the app would remain functioning on the phone.Given the prevalence of adware on the Google Play store, it's important to check the reviews of unfamiliar apps; these apps in particular racked up several one-star scores, with users pointing out the problems they've encountered. That said, we've even seen cases of adware being pre-installed on Android phones, though that's generally on phones not certified by Google.Trend Micro points out that this adware should ideally only affect phones running older versions of Android. ""Android 8.0 and later versions...have a function that asks for user confirmation before an application is allowed to create a shortcut,"" which would have alerted users to the app's otherwise hidden activity.Google frequently states that the company takes measures to prevent adware and malware from making it onto their digital storefront, yet new reports on dozens of nefarious apps surface on a regular basis. This most recent event likely won't be the one that pushes Google toward a more secure Play store, but after so many incidents, it's hard to imagine that push won't eventually come to shove.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/16/google-pulls-85-android-apps-adware/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

He is described as being 6ft 3in and is believed to have been panhandling in New York for several months. Chief Deputy M.A Mayes of the Logan County Sheriff's Department revealed to DailyMail.com that Griffin has had run-ins with the law dating back to 2011, with a warrant currently outstanding for his arrest.  Larry Griffin II, 26, of Bruno, West Virginia is the man captured on surveillance footage by police, pushing a shopping cart with rice cookers inside Fulton Street Station Surveillance video obtained by police shows a white man pushing a shopping cart with rice cookers inside and leaving them in Fulton Street Station and on one of its platformsGriffin has previously been charged for allegedly trying to seduce a juvenile male for sex through social mediaGriffin was charged in 2011 with possession of controlled substance and  possession of a weapon by a prohibited person.He was also later charged in 2017 with use of obscene matter to seduce minor and display of obscene material to minor, Chief Deputy Mayes said.According to a criminal complaint, Griffin sent a series of sexually explicit messages to the minor in July and November 2017. One of the messages was said to include a homemade video showing a man engaging in sex acts with an unspecified animal. In March a warrant was issued for his arrest for failure to report for drug screening which is part of his pre-trial bond supervision. His father, Larry Griffin, told New York Post his son left the area after being charged.Of Friday's incident, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller said Griffin is not considered a suspect of a crime at this time, but he is 'certainly someone we'd like to interview.'  Police first received a 911 call reporting two suspicious packages in Fulton Street Station at 7.15am. After deeming both to be safe and identifying them to be unmodified rice cookers, news of a third suspicious item was reported moments later a short distance away. According to a criminal complaint, Griffin sent a series of sexually explicit messages to the minor.

5147,"Jeffrey Epstein died of suicide by hanging, rules medical examiner","New York City's chief medical examiner on Friday concluded that suicide by hanging was the cause of death for financier Jeffrey Epstein, whose body was found seven days ago in a jail cell. The findings rebut conspiracy theories that he was murdered. Epstein, a fund manager worth hundreds of millions of dollars, was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City’s chief medical examiner determined on Friday that suicide by hanging was the cause of death for financier Jeffrey Epstein, whose body was found six days ago in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The sparely worded official announcement detailing the autopsy conclusions rebutted a host of conspiracy theories - including one promoted by President Donald Trump - that had circulated on social media about the death of the well-connected former money manager. Epstein’s lawyers said they were “not satisfied” with the medical examiner’s conclusions and planned to carry out their own investigation, seeking prison videos taken around the time of his death. Epstein, 66, was found unresponsive on Saturday in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), triggering investigations into the circumstances of his death. He was arrested on July 6 and pleaded not guilty to federal charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14. Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson said her determination of the cause of death came after a “careful review of all investigative information, including complete autopsy findings.” “Cause: Hanging. Manner: Suicide,” the statement said, without providing supporting details for Sampson’s findings. Details of the findings had been leaking into the news media over the past few days. Two law enforcement sources told Reuters on Thursday that Epstein’s neck had been broken in several places, confirming a Washington Post report that to some had raised questions about possible foul play. Epstein, a registered sex offender who once counted Trump and former President Bill Clinton as friends, pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state charges of unlawfully paying a teenage girl for sex.  Epstein had been on suicide watch at the jail but was taken off prior to his death, a source who was not authorized to speak on the matter said previously. At the MCC, two jail guards are required to make separate checks on all prisoners every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not followed, the source added. “It is indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols,” Epstein’s lawyers Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said in a statement, describing conditions in the area he was held as, “harsh, even medieval.” U.S. Attorney General William Barr has criticized “serious irregularities” at the facility.

5158,Smugglers on B'desh border tie IEDs on cattle to target BSF,Cattle smugglers active in the India-Bangladesh border region have reportedly begun tying Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) around the necks of cattle to target the Border Security Force (BSF). The matter came to light after BSF personnel seized cattle from border area of West Bengal's Malda last month. A BSF jawan was attacked with crude bombs by cattle smugglers last month.,The New Indian Express,"KOLKATA: The cattle smugglers active in West Bengal’s India-Bangladesh border region are tying improvised explosive devices around the cattle’s neck to take on the jawans of the Border Security Force (BSF). The strategy risking the lives of the security force personnel came to light after the BSF personnel seized cattle from a border area in Malda district last month.“We never came across such modus operandi to challenge our men before. Using such IEDs could fatally injure both cattle and person who caught it. A message alerting our men has been conveyed to all the border out-posts along the Indo-Bangla border,’’ said Y.B. Khurania, inspector general of south Bengal frontier.“Bearing-balls, bolts and pieces of sharp articles were used as shrapnel which could have been fatal had the IEDs exploded,’’ said a BSF officer.Interrogation by the state police personnel, who were handed over three cattle smugglers last month in Malda, also revealed the IEDs were procured from Murshidabad district. “They collected the IEDs from a supplier who deals with IEDs and crude bombs. Murshidabad and its adjoining Malda districts are infamous for manufacturing IEDs and crude bombs. The two districts cater most of these contraband items to hooligans, smugglers and criminals,’’ said an officer of Malda district. “A BSF jawan was attacked with crude bombs when he had chased a group of cattle smugglers at Basirhat border last month and the security person’s hand had to be amputated,’’ he added. The manufacturing cost of each of the IEDs tied around the cattle’s neck was around Rs 150 to Rs 200 and the cattle smuggler had to pay Rs 500 for each one. “The accused smugglers confessed that they could bear the cost of the IEDs because the profit margin in the illegal trade is quite high,’’ said

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he was having dinner on Friday with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook of Apple Inc, a company the president has criticized for not manufacturing more of its products in the United States. “Having dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple. They will be spending vast sums of money in the U.S. Great!” Trump, who is on a working vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, said in a Twitter message. The White House did not immediately respond to a question about the agenda for the dinner and what Trump was referring to when he said Apple would be spending vast sums in the United States. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has said he wants Apple and other manufactures to move their production from China and other countries to the United States. Another round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports had been due to take effect in Sept. 1, but the Trump administration this week delayed the tariffs on some products until Dec. 15. “We’re doing this for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. customers,” Trump said on Tuesday after the announcement. Levies on Apple’s MacBooks and iPhones were delayed until December, while tariffs on its AirPods, Apple Watch and HomePod will go into effect as scheduled next month. The United States and China are locked in a trade war over U.S. demands that China change its policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers.

Adding that regional parties will lose their importance soon, Chowdhury stated, ""Their losing importance means the nation will head towards bipolar politics.""",Times Now,"Kolkata: The leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, has said it will be tough for any leader from outside the Gandhi-Nehru family to run the party, as it has ""brand equity"".He also said the revival of the Congress largely depended on the weakening of regional parties that lack ideology, and claimed that the country was headed for ""bipolar politics"".Chowdhury said only a party like the Congress, with its ""strong"" ideological mooring, and pan-India presence, can counter the ""communal juggernaut"" of the BJP.""The way regional parties are functioning, they will lose their importance in the days to come. Their losing importance means the nation will head towards bipolar politics.""When there is bipolar politics, we would again come back to power. So, the future of the Congress is bright,"" Chowdhury told PTI.Responding to a question, he said regional parties lack ideological motivation and mass support a national party like the Congress has.He said Sonia Gandhi was reluctant to helm the party once again, but yielded to the request of senior Congress functionaries when the organisation was facing a ""crisis"" after Rahul Gandhi's resignation.""Sonia Gandhi has led the party in times of crisis. It was due to her leadership in difficult times that the Congress was able to form the government twice in 2004 and 2009,"" Chowdhury said.The Congress leader from West Bengal said while Sonia Gandhi heads the party as interim chief, efforts are underway to elect a new party president.Chowdhury, a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) - the highest decision-making body of the party - however, noted it would be tough for someone from outside the Gandhi family to run the party.""It would indeed be difficult for someone from outside the Gandhi family to run the party. In politics, too, there is brand equity. If you look at the present BJP, without Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, will it function smoothly? The answer is no.""In our Congress party, too, the Gandhi family is our brand equity. There is no harm in it. No one else in our party has the charisma which they have. It is a hard reality,"" he said.Sonia Gandhi, 72, was appointed the interim Congress president barely 20 months after she had voluntarily relinquished the post in favour of son Rahul, who refused to continue as the party chief after the humiliating 2019 general election defeat.Chowdhury lauded Rahul Gandhi's decision of owning responsibility for the party's defeat, and said the ""noble step"" was worth emulating by other leaders.He said the result could have been different had Rahul Gandhi been declared the joint opposition candidate for prime ministership, as the BJP had turned the general election into a presidential-style contest.While speaking about the alleged tussle between the Congress's old guard and the young leadership represented by Rahul Gandhi, he said, the current party leadership was a mix of the old and the new.The party's old guard was said to have prevailed upon the new in bringing Sonia Gandhi back to the helm, while Rahul Gandhi insisted on a young leader for the post.""The mixture of old and the new is good for the party. There may be difference of ideas but the goal is the same,"" he said.
Chowdhury, a five-tme MP from the Beharampore Lok Sabha seat in West Bengal, however, conceded that the party needed to undertake measures for increased public acceptability.He said the political narrative, currently driven by the BJP's ""communal agenda"", will change.""We need to increase our acceptance. It is the Congress which is fighting against the BJP, both ideologically and politically. Right now the narrative of communal politics may seem dominant, but it won't be permanent. Things will change. There are more pressing issues like jobs, food, and livelihood,"" he said.Chowdhury said abrogation of provisions of Article 370 granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir has set a ""dangerous example"", and will lead to ""greater interference by the Centre"" in governance of states.""The way Article 370 was abrogated is unprecedented and undemocratic. We have seen UTs being converted into states but this is for the first time that a state has been turned into two union territories,"" he said.On the Congress speaking in different voices about Article 370, Chowdhury said it was because the government rushed through the bills.""As this bill was brought in great hurry, we didn't have time to discuss the matter within the party. So, there was confusion about the party's stand. But, once the CWC passed a resolution on the issue, there is absolutely no differences or confusion in the party,"" he added.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/it-will-be-tough-for-any-leader-from-outside-gandhi-nehru-family-to-run-congress-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury/470536?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Go home, start exercising.' And mere seconds after the president ordered to 'get him out of here,' Trump returned to the teleprompter to tell the crowd: 'Our movement is built on love'. But in fact the protester was not thin at all - and it appears to be an overweight Trump protester called Frank Dawson, who followed the protester down the stairs as he was escorted from the arena, who the president thought was the guilty party.Dawson laughed it off afterwards, telling Fox News he knew Trump was referring to him.Dawson, who said he had 'law enforcement and military experience,' said he had acted against the protesters, from If Not Now, a Jewish group which wants Israel to leave the West Bank. 'Because he didn't see me ripping the signs away from those three people that were sitting near us, and they were trying to cause a ruckus, and they jumped up and they started yelling stuff, that I don't even care what they were yelling about, that wasn't going to happen beside me because I'm trying to listen to my president,' he said.Donald Trump told a protester in front of a revved up crowed in New Hampshire Thursday night: 'That guy's got a serious weight problem.

I was the good part of it.'He said, 'Hey, that guy needs to lose a little weight!!''Dawson added: 'Everything's good! I love the guy! He's the best thing that ever happened to this country.' Apart from anything else Trump appears to be throwing stones at glass houses, considering he himself is medically obese, standing 6ft 3in and tipping the scale at 243lbs - four pounds more than his physical examination the year prior.   Trump's previous doctor in 2018 put him on a diet and exercise regimen that was intended to help him lose 10 - 15 pounds over the course of the year.Trump - who notoriously loves fast food - was officially deemed obese in February after a physical examination found he weighed 243lbs, standing at 6ft 3in He gained four pounds, instead, after failing to 'religiously' follow it, his physical revealed in February. The president is known for indulging in greasy fast food including KFC and McDonald's. And in typical Trump fashion, he continued Thursday's rally with searing attacks on into his political opponents.He blasted the Green New Deal and Democrats competing for his job in the opening minutes of the Manchester rally.  The president has held back at times on unleashing on the group but revived slams on Elizabeth Warren for her native American heritage scandal 'Pocahontas' and 'Sleepy Joe Biden' for his small crowds and lagging campaign schedule.'What about a Sleepy Joe Biden rally? Right? Boy, he's made some beauties. I sort of hope it's him. I don't mind any of them. You got Pocahontas, who's rising. You've got Kamala. Kamala is falling. You got Beto. Beto is like gone,' he said, whirling his finger.The president said: 'I don't know that it matters. But whoever it is, different, different people. But I don't know, I think Sleepy Joe may be able to limp across the finish line. Might be. But today they announced that they're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster they're going to have fewer appearances. 'You heard this, right? They're going to cut way back on his appearances. Can you believe it? If I ever did that, it would be over! The fake news would get us. And we don't let them get us. And it is fake,' he argued. Trump revved up a crowd of supporters (pictured) in New Hampshire on Thursday night with searing attacks on into his political opponents Trump was rallying his supporters at SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire. He said in a radio interview Thursday morning that 12,000 people have requested tickets. The arena would be over capacity, if that many people showed. Trump rallied supporters in the same arena, when it went by a different name, in his first campaign for president. He memorably called Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a p***y' at the event at the height of an ugly personal disputeThe president won the Republican primary for the presidency in the state in 2016. He lost the general election to Hillary Clinton later that year and is determined to turn the Granite State red in the next national election.    ",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7362469/Go-home-start-exercising-Trump-mocks-protester-having-weight-problem.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5196,Apple sues cybersecurity startup for selling virtual copies of iOS,"Apple is suing cybersecurity startup Corellium over allegations that it made ""virtual"" copies of the iPhone maker's iOS and ""illegally"" sold them. Apple said that the startup masks its true goal of ""profiting off its blatant infringement"" under the guise that it's ""a research tool for those trying to discover security vulnerabilities and other flaws"". Corellium was founded in 2017.",TechCrunch,"Apple  is suing virtualization software company Corellium, according to documents filed today in Florida.Corellium  allows customers to create and interact with virtual iOS devices — a software iPhone, for example, running actual iOS firmware, all within the browser. Apple says this is copyright infringement, and is demanding Corellium stops “all uses of” its iOS virtualization products and pays Apple unspecified “damages and lost profits.”Corellium could allow, for example, a security researcher to quickly fire up a simulated iPhone and hunt for potential bugs. If one is discovered, they can quickly load up prior versions of iOS to see how long this bug has been around. If a bug “bricks” the virtual iOS device and renders it unusable, it’s a matter of just booting up a new one rather than obtaining a whole new phone. Virtualized devices can be paused, giving researchers a detailed look at its precise state at any given moment.Forbes did a deep dive on the company last year. As they point out, two of the company’s co-founders were some of the earliest members of the iPhone jailbreak scene, giving them an understanding better than nearly anyone else in the world as to how iPhones, iPads, etc. work under the hood.In its complaint, Apple writes:The product Corellium offers is a “virtual” version of Apple mobile hardware products, accessible to anyone with a web browser. Specifically, Corellium serves up what it touts as a perfect digital facsimile of a broad range of Apple’s market-leading devices—recreating with fastidious attention to detail not just the way the operating system and applications appear visually to bona fide purchasers, but also the underlying computer code. Corellium does so with no license or permission from Apple.This news comes just days after Apple announced that it would be launching an “iOS Security Research Device Program,” in which select security researchers would be given access to less-locked-down iOS devices in order to help them find vulnerabilities.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/apple-is-suing-corellium/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5203,US lawmaker rejects Israel's offer of 'humanitarian' visit,"US lawmaker Rashida Tlaib has rejected Israel's offer to let her travel to the West Bank to visit her family on ""humanitarian grounds"". Tlaib said the Israeli government had imposed ""oppressive conditions"" to humiliate her. Israel had initially denied entry to Tlaib, however, after she wrote to Israel Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, she was allowed to visit her family.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. congresswoman Rashida Tlaib on Friday rejected an offer by Israel to let her travel to the West Bank, the latest twist in a dispute drawing Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu together against U.S. Democrats ahead of elections in both countries.  Tlaib, a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives who has been critical of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians, said she would not visit her family there because the Israeli government had imposed “oppressive conditions” to humiliate her. She had planned to make an official visit to Israel along with fellow Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, under public pressure from Republican President Trump, on Thursday said he would not allow the pair to make their trip. On Friday, Israel said it would allow Tlaib to visit family in the Israel-occupied West Bank on humanitarian grounds. The Michigan congresswoman rejected the offer, however. “I can’t allow the State of Israel to take away that light by humiliating me & use my love for my sity to bow down to their oppressive & racist policies,” Tlaib tweeted, using the word sity to refer to her grandmother.  “Silencing me & treating me like a criminal is not what she wants for me. It would kill a piece of me. I have decided that visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in—fighting against racism, oppression & injustice,” she said.      Israel’s Interior Ministry said it had received a letter from Tlaib on Thursday seeking permission to visit her family in the West Bank village of Beit Ur Al-Fauqa, and it granted her request.  Tlaib did not outline what the conditions imposed on her visit were. Israeli media reported that she had agreed not to promote boycotts against Israel as part of her request to Israel’s Foreign Ministry.      Trump criticized Tlaib for opting not to travel to Israel after she was permitted to visit only her grandmother.  “As soon as she was granted permission, she grandstanded & loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday evening. “Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!”  Tlaib and Omar have voiced support for the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement which opposes the  Israeli occupation and policies toward Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. BDS backers can be denied entry to Israel by law.   Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, who approved Tlaib’s visit request, blasted her decision not to come. “It turns out that it was a provocation to embarrass Israel. Her hatred for Israel overcomes her love for her grandmother,” he wrote on Twitter.   The initial ban sparked an outcry among Democrats in the U.S. Congress, who have largely been strong supporters of Israel, raising concerns about straining the two nations’ relationship as Netanyahu aligns himself ever more closely with Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer have strongly backed U.S. aid to Israel, which totals $3.8 billion annually, but both called on Israel to reverse the ban on their fellow Democrats on Thursday.   U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer, the second-most powerful Democrat in the House, said Israel’s demands for Tlaib to visit her grandmother were unacceptable. “Not only was this request disrespectful of Rep. Tlaib but of the United States Congress as well,” Hoyer said in a statement on Friday. “This matter is a self-inflicted wound by one of America’s closest allies, one of our closest friends, and a vibrant democracy.”  The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a powerful Jewish lobbying group, said while it did not support the two congresswomen’s views, they should be allowed to visit.  Most Republicans in Congress have largely remained silent about the dispute. The fact that lawmakers are on a month-long recess has allowed them to avoid pointed questions. Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio was critical of Israel’s move but also of the two congresswomen. “... Denying them entry into #Israel is a mistake,” Rubio wrote on Twitter. “Being blocked is what they really hoped for all along in order to bolster their attacks against the Jewish state.”     Tlaib and Omar are the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress, and the Detroit-born Tlaib is also the first Palestinian-American congresswoman. Both are members of their party’s progressive wing and sharp critics of Trump and Israeli policy.     Their official visit was to have included visits to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which Palestinians envisage as part of an independent state along with Gaza. The moves by Trump and Netanyahu could help them whip up support in their conservative voter bases as each heads into election campaigns. Israel holds a national election on Sept. 17 and Trump faces re-election in November 2020. Trump has been attacking Tlaib and Omar, along with lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts - all women of color known as the Squad - for weeks, accusing them of hostility to Israel in a barrage condemned by critics as racist.          While most Democrats disagree with the views of Tlaib and Omar on Israel, Trump’s repeated attacks have rallied support. The president in turn has tried to paint that support as an endorsement of the two lawmakers’ position and sought to make them the face of the party.  Tlaib and Omar represent districts in states Trump is aiming to win in his 2020 re-election campaign: Michigan, which he narrowly won in 2016, and Minnesota, which he narrowly lost.  Tlaib “knows what she’s doing and she believes so strongly in justice in Palestine that she’s giving up her chance to see her grandmother,” says Frank Smith, 65, a retired auto worker in Detroit. “She must be doing something right because she’s driving Trump nuts.” Reporting by Rami Ayyub, additional reporting by David Morgan in Washington and Steve Friess in Ann Arbor; Writing by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall and Cynthia Osterman",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-usa/u-s-rep-tlaib-rejects-west-bank-visit-citing-israels-oppressive-conditions-idUSKCN1V60SN?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Akhundzada's son was wounded in the attack. Police officials said a timed device was planted under the wooden chair of the prayer leader. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.,Reuters,"QUETTA, Pakistan/KABUL (Reuters) - The brother of the leader of the Afghan Taliban was among at least four people killed in a bomb blast at a mosque in Pakistan on Friday, two Taliban sources told Reuters, an attack that could affect efforts to end the Afghan war. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast which took place as the Taliban and the United States are in the final stages of talks on an agreement that would see America withdraw its troops from neighboring Afghanistan. Police said more than 20 people were wounded and the death toll could rise. The imam of the mosque, 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the southwestern city of Quetta, was among those killed, police said. Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada was not in the mosque when the bomb went off but his younger brother, Hafiz Ahmadullah, was among those killed. “We lost younger brother of Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada in a bomb blast,” said a senior member of the Taliban who declined to be identified. Akhundzada’s son was wounded, one of the sources said. The mosque and an adjoining religious school were known to be visited by members of the Afghan Taliban. Akhundzada used to teach and lead prayers at the complex, the senior Taliban member said. Pakistani police did not confirm the identity of any of the victims. “It was a timed device planted under the wooden chair of the prayer leader,” said Abdul Razzaq Cheema, chief of police in Quetta, capital of Balochistan province. One of the sources, who visited the site after the blast, said security at the mosque was always very tight. Separatist insurgents and Islamist militants are active in Balochistan but many in Pakistan are likely to suspect the Afghan government, which is battling the Taliban in Afghanistan, of involvement in the blast. There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government. Pakistan has promised to help the United States end the Afghan war, its longest conflict, and both U.S. and Taliban negotiators have recently reported significant progress in their talks in Qatar. But Friday’s blast will raise concerns about prospects for peace. The Taliban, in exchange for a U.S. troop withdrawal, are expected to guarantee that Afghanistan will not be used for international terrorism. The militants, fighting to expel foreign forces and set up an Islamic state, are also expected to make a commitment to open power-sharing talks with the U.S.-backed government and begin a ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump is keen to bring the troops home but many Afghans fear a U.S. troop withdrawal would leave the government battling the Taliban alone. The United States has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, with a focus on training Afghan forces and counter-terrorism.  The Taliban roam through more territory now than they have since the United States ousted them from power in 2001 for sheltering al Qaeda militants behind the Sept. 11 attacks, and fighting between government forces and the insurgents has been heavy.

China had warned of unspecified ""countermeasures"" over the sale. US is bound by law to help provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress should move quickly with an $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan as the self-ruled island faces pressure from China’s increased military presence in the region, leading U.S. Democratic and Republican lawmakers said on Friday.  China denounced the planned sale, one of the biggest yet by the United States to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. It warned of unspecified “countermeasures.”    Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch, a Republican, welcomed the proposed sale of the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-16V jets. “These fighters are critical to improving Taiwan’s ability to defend its sovereign airspace, which is under increasing pressure from the People’s Republic of China,” he said in a statement. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee, Jim Inhofe, and fellow Republican Senator John Cornyn said Taiwan “remains an important pillar of security and stability” in the region. The sale of the jets would “deter aggression given Beijing’s increasing assertiveness and military buildup,” they said in a joint statement. Similarly, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, and the panel’s ranking Republican, Michael McCaul, said in a joint statement that the deal “sends a strong message” about U.S. commitment to security and democracy in the region. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both Republicans, also issued statements backing the deal. Washington has no formal ties with self-ruled and democratic Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself. It is the main arms supplier to Taiwan and there is broad support for this in Congress. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control and has repeatedly denounced U.S. arms sales to the island. Friday’s New York Times quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that the Trump administration, which is engaged in a major trade war with China, was moving forward with the sale and said the State Department gave informal notification of the plan to the House and Senate foreign affairs committees on Thursday. The paper said once those committees gave the go ahead, which would probably come within days or weeks, there would follow a formal notification to Congress, which would trigger a 30-day period for objections. The State Department and White House declined to comment. China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing had made solemn representations to the United States over the planned sale.  China’s state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Hua as saying that it was a serious violation of the “one-China principle,” under which Washington recognizes Beijing and not Taipei, and undermined China’s sovereignty and security interests. Hua urged the U.S. to stop arms sales to and military contact with Taiwan, otherwise, the Chinese side would “certainly take countermeasures,” Xinhua said. After the United States approved sales of tanks and Raytheon Co’s (RTN.N) anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Taiwan in July, China said it was “ready to go to war” if people “try to split Taiwan from the country.” Beijing said it would impose sanctions on U.S. companies involved in any deals. On Thursday, Taiwan unveiled its largest defense spending increase in more than a decade, to T$411.3 billion ($13.11 billion.)

5215,"UNSC feels India, Pak should avoid unilateral action on J&K: China","Zhang Jun, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, said on Friday that members of the United Nations Security Council feel India and Pakistan should both refrain from unilateral action over Kashmir. He added that the situation in Kashmir is ""already very tense and very dangerous."" His remarks come after UNSC's closed-door meeting to discuss India revoking Article 370.",Reuters,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Security Council members believe India and Pakistan should refrain from taking unilateral action over the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir, China’s U.N. envoy said on Friday after the council met on the issue for the first time in decades. The 15-member council met behind closed doors at the request of China and Pakistan after India removed the decades-old autonomy the Muslim-majority territory of Jammu and Kashmir enjoyed under the Indian constitution. China rarely requests Security Council meetings. India’s U.N. Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said the decision was an internal matter and that the country was committed to ensuring the situation remained “calm and peaceful.”  China proposed that the Security Council issue a statement on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, but diplomats said the United States, France and Germany objected. Such statements are agreed by consensus.  China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun summed up the council discussions, describing serious concern over the situation. No other Security Council members spoke publicly after the meeting. “They are also concerned about the human rights situation there and also it’s the general view of members that parties concerned should refrain from taking any unilateral action that might further aggravate the tension there since the tension is already very tense and very dangerous,” Zhang said.  Akbaruddin accused Zhang of trying to pass off his remarks as “the will of the international community.”  In response to a question about human rights, Akbaruddin said: “If there are issues, they will be discussed, they will be addressed by our courts; we don’t need international busybodies to try and tell us how to run our lives. We are a billion-plus people.” The Himalayan region has long been a flashpoint in ties between India and Pakistan, which both have nuclear arms. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called on the two countries to refrain from any steps that could affect Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.  Telephone and internet links were cut and public assembly banned just before India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir earlier this month. The top state official said authorities would begin restoring some telephone lines in the region on Friday night. Zhang said “it’s obvious that the constitutional amendment by India has changed the status quo in Kashmir, causing tensions in the region” and called for the issue to be resolved through peaceful means according to the U.N. Charter, Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements.  Pakistan’s U.N. Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi described her country’s push for Friday’s Security Council meeting as “the first and not the last step.” She said it was the first time in more than 50 years that the council had taken up the issue.  “The fact that this meeting took place is testimony to the fact that this is an internationally recognized dispute,” she told reporters. “The people of Jammu and Kashmir may be locked up ... but their voices were heard today at the United Nations.” The Security Council adopted several resolutions in 1948 and in the 1950s on the dispute between India and Pakistan over the region, including one which says a plebiscite should be held to determine the future of mostly Muslim Kashmir. Another resolution also calls upon both sides to “refrain from making any statements and from doing or causing to be done or permitting any acts which might aggravate the situation.” U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed since 1949 to observe a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.

5228,US warrant issued for seizure of Iran tanker freed by Gibraltar,"Based on a complaint by the US government, a US court has issued a warrant for the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker that British Royal Marines had seized last month in Gibraltar. The British overseas territory of Gibraltar had on Thursday released the tanker. The tanker shifted its position on Friday, but its anchor was still down off Gibraltar.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Newly released U.S. court documents show the United States issued a warrant for the seizure of an Iranian tanker that British Royal Marines had seized last month in Gibraltar, citing  evidence that it was transporting oil to Syria in violation of U.S. sanctions. The oil tanker Grace 1, the more than 2 million barrels of oil it carries and $995,000 are subject to forfeiture based on a complaint by the U.S. government, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu said in a news release on Friday. The tanker was seized by British Royal Marines at the western mouth of the Mediterranean on July 4 on suspicion of violating European Union sanctions by taking oil to Syria, a close ally of Iran. In a court document obtained by Reuters, it said there was evidence that showed that the tanker was scheduled to arrive in Syria in early July.  “Charts and electronic equipment recovered from onboard the Grace 1, WhatsApp messages recovered from crewmembers’ mobile devices, and crewmembers’ statements revealed that the Grace 1 was destined for Port Banias, Syria in violation of U.S. sanctions,” the document said.  Iran has repeatedly denied that tanker’s destination was Syria. “As we said earlier ... Syria was not its destination and we have upheld the same ... and reiterated that it was nobody’s business even if it was Syria,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency on Friday. Gibraltar authorities said on Thursday the U.S. Department of Justice had applied to seize the tanker. Washington had attempted to detain the Grace 1 on the grounds that it had links to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which it has designated a terrorist organization. “The scheme involves multiple parties affiliated with the IRGC and furthered by the deceptive voyages of the Grace 1,” Liu said. “A network of front companies allegedly laundered millions of dollars in support of such shipments.” “A seizure warrant and a forfeiture complaint are merely allegations. The burden to prove forfeitability in a civil forfeiture proceeding is upon the government,” the news release said. Gibraltar, which said it first received a U.S. Department of Justice request to seize the Grace 1 tanker on Thursday, lifted the tanker’s detention order later in the same day., But the vessel’s fate was further complicated by a last-ditch U.S. legal appeal to hold it. The tanker shifted its position on Friday, but its anchor was still down off Gibraltar and it was unclear if it was ready to set sail soon. The warrant for the seizure of the tanker, which carries 2.1 million barrels of oil, was issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and addressed to “the United States Marshal’s Service and/or any other duly authorized law enforcement officer.” Reporting by Mohammad Zargham in WASHINGTON and Roslan Khasawneh in SINGAPORE, Editing by Leslie Adler & Simon Cameron-Moore",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-iran-tanker-usa/u-s-warrant-issued-for-seizure-of-iranian-oil-tanker-in-gibraltar-idUSKCN1V6237?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5244,Users sue FB for failure to warn of known risks before 2018 breach,"Facebook was sued by users over allegations that it failed to warn of known risks related to its single sign-on tool before a September 2018 data breach, court filings revealed. The users alleged Facebook failed to fix it for years, despite knowing about the vulnerability. They further claimed it took steps to protect its own employees from the security risk.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) users suing the world’s largest social media network over a 2018 data breach say it failed to warn them about risks tied to its single sign-on tool, even though it protected its employees, a court filing on Thursday showed. Single sign-on connects users to third-party social apps and services using their Facebook credentials. The lawsuit, which combined several legal actions, stems from Facebook Inc’s worst-ever security breach in September, when hackers stole login codes - or “access tokens” - that allowed them to access nearly 29 million accounts. “Facebook knew about the access token vulnerability and failed to fix it for years, despite that knowledge,” the plaintiffs said in a heavily redacted section of the filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. “Even more egregiously, Facebook took steps to protect its own employees from the security risk, but not the vast majority of its users.” Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Judge William Alsup told Facebook in January he was willing to allow “bone-crushing discovery” in the case to uncover how much user data was stolen. Facebook has revealed few details since initially disclosing the attack, saying only that it affected a “broad” spectrum of users without breaking down the numbers by country. The attackers took profile details such as birth dates, employers, education history, religious preference, types of devices used, pages followed and recent searches and location check-ins from 14 million users. For the other 15 million users, the breach was restricted to name and contact details. In addition, attackers could see the posts and lists of friends and groups of about 400,000 users. They did not steal personal messages or financial data and did not access users’ accounts on other websites, Facebook said.

5245,Apple sued for 3rd time for allegedly stealing dual-camera tech,Israel-based Corephotonics has sued Apple for the third time over claims that the iPhone-maker stole the technology used in the dual cameras. Apple allegedly infringed on 10 patents on every dual-camera present in iPhone 7 Plus and above. Corephotonics had first sued Apple after it analysed the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus cameras in November 2017.,BGR,"Back in 2017, Apple was sued by Israeli-based camera technology company Corephotonics. According to the lawsuit, the company accused Apple of using patents without a license. The patents have to do with dual cameras and zoom features on the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus.Now, Corephotonics has once again filed a new suit claiming that Apple infringed 10 patents on every dual camera iPhone released after the iPhone 7 Plus (via Apple Insider). These include the iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.According to the Israeli company, Corephotonics and the Cupertino giant have been in negotiations since 2012. Through the years, the company has discussed dual cameras in detail with the engineering team at Apple. In fact, Apple was granted access to five-element telephoto lens in 2012. Along with it, lenses and test board were offered in 2014. Corephotonics also offered black box simulation files having lens designs, system prototypes and software simulator. The lawsuit also alleges that this was critical for developing camera modules in today’s iPhones.In 2016 when Apple launched the iPhone 7 Plus with dual cameras, it did not strike a deal with Corephotonics. And when the company reached out for partnership, there was no success. In November 2017, the company examined the camera modules on the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus. Corephotonics then filed the first patent infringement lawsuit claiming that the zoom technology used on those phones heavily relies on their patents.The second lawsuit was then filed in April 2018. This time, the iPhone X was targeted. And now, the latest lawsuit targets the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. The company is also claiming that Apple is completely aware of the patent infringements.Interestingly, Corephotonics was reportedly acquired by Samsung in a deal worth $150 million. However, none of the companies issued any official statement related to the acquisition.775609539061060",https://www.bgr.in/news/apple-accused-of-stealing-dual-camera-technology-on-iphones/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The feat was achieved by Air India flight AI173 from Delhi to San Francisco, which usually flies over the Pacific Ocean to enter the US. Air India said the route will reduce travelling time and save fuel.",Times Now,"Air India, India's flag carrier airline, would be the first in the world which will operate flights over the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean as well as the Polar region, said AI spokesperson.Air India CMD Ashwani Lohani flagged off AI 173, the first commercial flight from Delhi to San Francisco via the North Pole, on August 15 (India's Independence Day). The plane is currently on its way to San Francisco. However, in an earlier instance, Air India's Boeing 777 in 2007 travelled over the polar region.The flights that go from New Delhi to San Francisco generally fly from the eastern and western route. The aircraft, on the eastern route, go over China, Japan before crossing the Pacific Ocean to reach its destination (San Francisco), while the flights that take the western route fly over Europe crossing the Atlantic Ocean to reach the US. However, the new route goes over Russia, the Arctic Ocean and Canada.With the new route, the distance between New Delhi and San Francisco has come down from 12,000 km to 8,000 km. The travelling time has also reduced by around 90 minutes. Apart from this, owing to the new route, fuel savings would be in the range of 2,000 to 7,000 kilograms per flight. This route will also help in reducing carbon emission – in the range of 6,000 to 21,000 kilograms, per flight.The first commercial service would be operated by Captain Rajneesh Sharma and Captain Digvijay Singh, marking the ""maturing of civil aviation in India as another frontier is crossed"", said Air India Western Region Director Mukesh Bhatia a few days before the flight was to take off for the US.Besides this, Bhatia said that the area of magnetic unreliability, limited choices for diversion to alternative airports, solar radiation, fuel freezing, passenger and aircraft retrieval in case of diversions, are some specific factors requiring active mitigation to ensure equivalent levels of safety.Airlines, in 2011, got the permission to fly over the North Pole after the necessary changes in regulatory rules. Till the new regulations came, American regulators insisted that the nearest airport should not be more than three hours away from the North Pole.

5254,Cathay Pacific CEO quits after airline caught in Hong Kong protests,"Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific's CEO Rupert Hogg resigned on Friday to ""take responsibility"" following recent events. It fired two pilots over their involvement in pro-democracy protests, after being ordered by China's aviation regulator to suspend personnel who had engaged in illegal protests. The regulator imposed curbs on the airline after its staff took part in Hong Kong protests.",Reuters,"HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways CEO Rupert Hogg resigned in a shock move on Friday, amid mounting Chinese regulatory scrutiny of the Hong Kong carrier over the involvement of its employees in the city’s anti-government protests. The sudden departure signals growing pressure on the corporate sector in the Chinese-controlled former British colony, home to multinationals such as HSBC Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings, to support Beijing. Cathay Pacific, which has already terminated two pilots for engaging in illegal protests at the behest of the Chinese aviation regulator, named Augustus Tang as its new CEO. Tang is the head of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company - which like Cathay is managed by Swire Pacific Ltd. The airline also said Paul Loo had resigned as chief customer and commercial officer, to be replaced by the head of its low-cost arm Hong Kong Express, Ronald Lam.  Cathay Chairman John Slosar said recent events had called into question Cathay’s commitment to flight safety and security and put its reputation and brand under pressure. “This is regrettable as we have always made safety and security our highest priority,” he said in a statement. “We therefore think it is time to put a new management team in place who can reset confidence and lead the airline to new heights.” Cathay whose strong British links make it a symbol of Hong Kong’s colonial past, has emerged as the highest-profile corporate target as Beijing looks to quell protests in the territory that have gone on for 10 straight weeks. Hogg, who is British and was appointed CEO in May 2017, said it was right for Loo and him to take responsibility as leaders of the company. “This is a grave and critical time for our airlines,” Hogg said in an email to staff on Friday evening seen by Reuters. “There is no doubt that our brand and reputation are under immense pressure and this pressure has been growing for some weeks, particularly in the all-important market of mainland China.” He said in hindsight, he and Loo could have managed the crisis differently, but he did not elaborate in the email. Hogg’s resignation was first announced by Chinese state television, CCTV. It was unclear, however, if it would help revive the company’s reputation on the mainland.  “The roots are rotten. It doesn’t make a difference no matter who’s leading the company,” a Chinese social media user said on the Twitter-like Weibo platform in a post liked more than 2,000 times. Cathay has said it is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” and was confident Hong Kong would have a great future. “Cathay’s change in management could be a positive in the short term as it provides the company with a ‘clean slate’ so to speak,” BOCOM International analyst Luya You said.  “In the meantime, the focus for Cathay right now is still damage control for its branding. Its reputation among mainland passengers continues to falter, which could lead to more long-lasting damage that is harder and takes longer to rebound from.”  The airline, 30% owned by Air China, became embroiled in crosswinds between Beijing and pro-democracy groups in the Asian financial hub after some of its employees took part in the Hong Kong protests.  Cathay shares plumbed 10-year lows on Tuesday, but rebounded the next day after the airline condemned the protests, vowed to follow Chinese aviation regulations and terminated the employment of two pilots. Cathay this week cancelled 272 flights, affecting more than 55,000 passengers, as its home airport was shutdown by protests.  The carrier is also seeing a drop in forward bookings due to the local unrest, it said last week after swinging to a first-half profit based on a turnaround plan led by Hogg, a highly regarded executive in the aviation industry. “It is disappointing to learn of his resignation particularly given this current challenging period,” said an analyst, who was not authorised to speak publicly about personnel changes.

He said by doing so, the Modi government had united the country and opened the gates for development in the region.“We had been saying that Kashmir was an integral part of India. But Article 370 sent out the message that something was still incomplete,” he said. He said nothing was done about it because of vote bank politics of the Congress. He said even the soul of late Atal Bihari Vajpayee would be blessing PM Modi for revoking Article 370.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not indulge in vote bank politics and all he cares about is the motherland.

In 75 days, Modi ji did what was not been done in the country in 70 years.”Speaking on a major announcement made by PM Modi in his Independence Day speech a day ago, Shah said that a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) would be another step towards strengthening the security of the country. “This will enable the three forces of the country to work in better coordination. It will be like a thunderbolt to the enemy.”Praising Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for his work in the state, Shah said leaders of caste and class politics had created an atmosphere of hatred and discrimination in Haryana but the BJP government had brought about equitable development in the entire state.He said the Congress and the Chautala family had destroyed Haryana whereas the Khattar government had ended discrimination and corruption in jobs. He also mentioned the steps taken by the Central and state governments in the state. Setting the tone for the party’s campaign for the forthcoming Assembly elections, Shah said, “We are aiming to win more than 75 seats in the assembly elections to be held in Haryana.”“Whenever I came to Haryana as the national president, the people here have always fulfilled my wishes. In the previous Assembly elections, they gave the BJP a chance to form the government. In Lok Sabha elections, the state helped Modi ji come back to power. I am sure this time also, people will bless Khattar ji.”Shah also raised questions on former chief minister Bhupinder Hooda and Chautala governments and said that Haryana was known for land trade in the earlier governments. “Earlier governments played puppets in the hands of builders but the government of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has made corruption a thing of the past,” he said.",https://www.india.com/news/india/abrogation-of-article-370-a-milestone-for-unity-of-country-says-home-minister-amit-shah-in-haryanas-jind-3747052/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5271,VB Chandrasekhar convinced Srinivasan to buy Dhoni over Sehwag,"CSK's ex-chief selector VB Chandrasekhar, who passed away aged 57, convinced ex-owner of the franchise N Srinivasan to buy MS Dhoni instead of Virender Sehwag in the inaugural IPL auction in 2008. Chandrasekhar had revealed he went by his gut feeling and wanted to sign Dhoni despite Srinivasan preferring Sehwag as the wicketkeeper-batsman can change ""match situation on his own"".",Times Now,"New Delhi: After playing for Rising Pune Supergiant for two years, former Indian skipper MS Dhoni is all set to reunite with Chennai Super Kings in the 11th edition of the Indian Premier League. Since the inception of the tournament in 2008, the Yellow Brigade has become one of the most popular T20 franchises, not only in India, but globally, thanks to Dhoni's huge fan following. Over the years, Dhoni has honed the skills of several cricketers from across the globe who went on to play international cricket for their respective countries. At a time when other franchises refrained from splurging money on old horses in the recently concluded IPL auctions, CSK retained Dhoni as the skipper of the team for the 11th edition. But what many don't know, what that Dhoni wasn't the favourite to join CSK squad in 2008.Former Indian cricketer VB Chandrasekhar, who was CSK's chief selector in 2008 as well as director of cricket operations, recently told Sportskeeda about how he convinced Srinivasan to acquire the Jharkhand batsman instead of the 'Nawab of Najafgarh in the first season. He opened up about the conversation between him and N Srinivasan on whom to pick.“Before the auctions in 2008, Mr N Srinivasan asked me, “Who are you going to pick?” I said Dhoni. He asked, “Why not Virender Sehwag?”""I said Sehwag would not provide me with the kind of inspiration that the crowd will be looking forward to, whereas Dhoni is a captain, a wicket-keeper and a batsman who can change the match situation on his own. So I asked him if I could look for him,” Chandrasekhar was quoted by Sportskeeda.Chandrasekhar further said how and why CSK finalised on Dhoni. N Srinivasan said, “I would rather have Sehwag.” However, the next day morning, he came and said, “Go get Dhoni.”Chandrasekhar further elaborated about his plans to form a team around Dhoni with the small purse that was available to him for the team. He said, for Dhoni, the management had kept an amount of 1.1 million with a total of 5 million budget to buy the whole team. According to their sources, some other team were also targetting former Indian skipper in the auction and had kept 1.3 million for him. For that reason, CSK had to reassess the whole team structure. (IPL 2018 Auction: Chennai Super Kings troll Chris Gayle on Twitter, say 'team has decided against him')“So I increased my amount to 1.4 million and still tried to buy the team because, with a total of 5 million for the entire team, 1.4 million would have gone for Dhoni himself,” he continued.“But with the auction approaching, someone said that Dhoni would go for 1.8 million. So I told him that if Dhoni would go for anything beyond 1.5 million, I'd let him go because I couldn't let go a team, as then there would have been Dhoni and nobody else. Mr Srinivasan was upset that we couldn't get Dhoni because somewhere he believed that Dhoni was the future and I had convinced him that he was going to be the future youth icon,” Chandrasekhar further said. (IPL 2018: Full Squad list of every franchise)But as the narration goes, Dhoni went to the Chennai franchise for 1.5 million in 2008 auction and the rest is history.

5272,Twitter leads $100 million funding in Bengaluru's ShareChat,"Bengaluru-based vernacular social networking app ShareChat has raised $100 million in its Series D funding round led by micro-blogging giant Twitter. The funding round saw participation from investors including TrustBridge Partners, Shunwei Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, SAIF Capital, among others. Founded in 2015, ShareChat has raised about $223 million to date, as per Crunchbase.",TechCrunch,"Is there room for another social media platform? ShareChat,  a four-year-old social network in India that serves tens of million of people in regional languages, just answered that question with a $100 million financing round led by global giant Twitter .Other than Twitter, TrustBridge Partners, and existing investors Shunwei Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, SAIF Capital, India Quotient and Morningside Venture Capital also participated in the Series D round of ShareChat.The new round, which pushes ShareChat’s all-time raise to $224 million, valued the firm at about $650 million, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. ShareChat declined to comment on the valuation.“Twitter and ShareChat are aligned on the broader purpose of serving the public conversation, helping the world learn faster and solve common challenges. This investment will help ShareChat grow and provide the company’s management team access to Twitter’s executives as thought partners,” said Manish Maheshwari, managing director of Twitter India, in a prepared statement.Twitter, like many other Silicon Valley firms, counts India as one of its key markets. And like Twitter, other Silicon Valley firms are also increasingly investing in Indian startups.ShareChat serves 60 million users each month in 15 regional languages, Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and CEO of the firm, told TechCrunch in an interview. The platform currently does not support English, and has no plans to change that, Sachdeva said.That choice is what has driven users to ShareChat, he explained. The early incarnation of the social media platform supported English language. It saw most of its users choose English as their preferred language, but this also led to another interesting development: Their engagement with the app significantly reduced.“For some reason, everyone wanted to converse in English. There was an inherent bias to pick English even when they did not know it.” (Only about 10% of India’s 1.3 billion people speak English. Hindi, a regional language, on the other hand, is spoken by about half a billion people, according to official government figures.)So ShareChat pulled support for English. Today, an average user spends 22 minutes on the app each day, Sachdeva said. The learning in the early days to remove English is just one of the many things that has shaped ShareChat to what it is today and led to its growth.In 2014, Sachdeva and two of his friends — Bhanu Singh and Farid Ahsan, all of whom met at the prestigious institute IIT Kanpur — got the idea of building a debate platform by looking at the kind of discussions people were having on Facebook groups.They identified that cricket and movie stars were popular conversation topics, so they created WhatsApp groups and aggressively posted links to those groups on Facebook to attract users.It was then when they built chatbots to allow users to discover different genres of jokes, recommendations for phones and food recipes, among other things. But they soon realized that users weren’t interested in most of such offerings.“Nobody cared about our smartphone recommendations. All they wanted was to download wallpapers, ringtones, copy jokes and move on. They just wanted content.”So in 2015, Sachdeva and company moved on from chatbots and created an app where users can easily produce, discover and share content in the languages they understand. (Today, user generated content is one of the key attractions of the platform, with about 15% of its user base actively producing content.)A year later, ShareChat, like tens of thousands of other businesses, was in for a pleasant surprise. India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, launched his new telecom network Reliance Jio, which offered users access to the bulk of data at little to no charge for an extended period of time.This immediately changed the way millions of people in the country, who once cared about each megabyte they consumed online, interacted with the internet. On ShareChat people quickly started to move from sharing jokes and other messages in text format to images and then videos.That momentum continues to today. ShareChat now plans to give users more incentive — including money — and tools to produce content on the platform to drive engagement. “There remains a huge hunger for content in vernacular languages,” Sachdeva said.Speaking of money, ShareChat has experimented with ads on the app and its site, but revenue generation isn’t currently its primary focus, Sachdeva said. “We’re in the Series D now so there is obviously an obligation we have to our investors to make money. But we all believe that we need to focus on growth at this stage,” he said.ShareChat, which is headquartered in Bangalore, also has many users in Bangladesh, Nepal and the Middle East, where many users speak Indian regional languages. But the startup currently plans to focus largely on expanding its user base in India, hopefully doubling it in the next one year, he said.It will use the new capital to strengthen the technology infrastructure and hire more tech talent. Sachdeva said ShareChat is looking to open an office in San Francisco to hire local engineers there.A handful of local and global giants have emerged in India in recent years to cater to people in small cities and villages, who are just getting online. Pratilipi, a storytelling platform has amassed more than 5 million users, for instance. It recently raised $15 million to expand its user base and help users strike deals with content studios.Perhaps no other app poses a bigger challenge to ShareChat than TikTok, an app where users share short-form videos. TikTok, owned by one of the world’s most valued startups, has over 120 million users in India and sees content in many Indian languages.But the app — with its ever growing ambitions — also tends to land itself in hot water in India every few weeks. In all sensitive corners of the country. On that front, ShareChat has an advantage. Over the years, it has emerged as an outlier in the country that has strongly supported proposed laws by the Indian government that seek to make social apps more accountable for content that circulates on their platforms. Though it is grappling with some of this issue, too.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/sharechat-twitter-seriesd/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5275,Tamil Nadu Education Minister removes ban on 'caste bands' in schools,"After Tamil Nadu authorities issued a circular banning practice of making students wear wristbands to identify them by their castes, state's School Education Minister KA Sengottaiyan said the circular won't be implemented. ""Whatever practice (of wearing caste bands) exists...shall continue the way it is,"" he stated. Many schools in the state allegedly profiled students based on the band's colour.",The New Indian Express,"CHENNAI: School education minister KA Sengottaiyan said on Thursday that he had asked all education officials not to implement a recent circular issued by the department concerned warning severe action against schools making students wear wrist bands that identify their caste.“Whatever practice exists in Tamil Nadu shall continue the way it is,” he told Express over the phone.The usage of caste bands has been in practice for the last several years, especially in the northern districts of the State.Last year, a few physical education instructors and senior district-level officials were accused of discriminating against students, who wanted to participate in sports events, based on their caste.        The students were allegedly profiled based on the colour of the band they wore. There are also allegations about some schools prohibiting Dalit children from using common plates to eat the midday meals.Sengottaiyan, however, said the circular was issued without his knowledge. He termed it as ‘unnecessary’ and said it was passed ‘just to spark a controversy’. Interestingly, BJP leader H Raja was the first one to oppose the circular. “Preventing students from displaying their ‘religious’ symbols is an anti-Hindu move,” Raja had said on the caste band issue.It was the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department that first forwarded the circular to the School Education Department, the minister said.""It was subsequently issued without my knowledge,"" said Sengottaiyan.  The circular was issued on the basis of a representation lodged by 180 trainee IAS officers, who submitted that some schools in Tamil Nadu, made students to wear colour coded wrist bands. These wristbands, which come in shades of red, yellow, green and saffron indicate whether they belong to a ‘lower caste’ or ‘upper caste’ in addition to this, rings and forehead tilak on the head were used as a caste marker.Sengottaiyan, however, denied that this practice exists and said that ""no such thing happens in 99 per cent of the State schools."" It may happen very rarely, but I'm unaware of any such incident in Tamil Nadu, he asserted.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2019/aug/16/no-ban-on-usage-of-caste-bands-in-tamil-nadu-schools-education-minister-2019539.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5277,Hong Kong's richest man urges to stop protests in 'name of love',"Hong Kong's richest man, 91-year-old Li Ka-shing, urged a halt to the anti-government protests ""in the name of love"" and asked the public to ""love China, love Hong Kong, love yourself"". In front-page advertisements in local newspapers, the billionaire said, ""Love freedom, love tolerance, love the rule of law"". The advertisements were signed ""a Hong Kong citizen Li Ka-shing"".",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - The boss of Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific Airways quit on Friday, the highest-profile corporate casualty of unrest roiling the former British colony, after Beijing targeted the airline over staff involvement in mass protests. The corporate upheaval comes ahead of a weekend where further protests are planned, including what could be a large gathering on Sunday that could test whether a movement that has enjoyed broad support can retain it, even as violence escalates. Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that has enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997. Several thousand protesters gathered peacefully at a downtown park on Friday for the “Stand with Hong Kong, Power to the People” rally, which had received police permission. Other protests planned for the weekend do not have police permission.  A rally set for Sunday by the Civil Human Rights Front, which organised million-strong marches in June, has only been allowed permission for an assembly in Victoria Park on Hong Kong island, though not a march, due to safety concerns. The group is appealing against the police decision. A ban on a march in Kowloon’s Hung Hom district on Saturday was overturned on Friday. Ten weeks of confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into turmoil, and present the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. Police tactics against protesters have been hardening. Nearly 750 people have been arrested since the protests began in June, and tear gas has frequently been used by police in attempts to disperse protests across the city.     China has likened the increasingly violent protests to terrorism and warned it could use force to quell them, as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Xi meet protesters to defuse the tension. Chinese paramilitary troops have been training this week in Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, in a clear warning to the protesters. Hong Kong police reiterated on Friday that they are capable of maintaining law and order on their own. Cathay Pacific, an emblem of the city, was blindsided last week when China’s aviation regulator demanded it suspend staff supporting a movement that has mushroomed from opposition to a legal change in Hong Kong into wider calls for democracy. The abrupt departure of Chief Executive Rupert Hogg, a move the company said was “to take responsibility ... in view of recent events,” shows just how much pressure Beijing is piling on corporate giants and the city as it seeks to snuff out the protests. Cathay became embroiled in the confrontation after one of its pilots was arrested at a demonstration in July. China’s aviation regulator demanded any staff involved or supportive of the protests be removed from duty on flights to or over mainland airspace. The company, whose chairman had initially said, before the demand, that it “wouldn’t dream” of telling staff what to think, later acceded to the request, firing two pilots and saying  “overly radical” staff would be suspended from mainland duties. Hogg said these had been “challenging weeks” for the airline and it was right for him, and the company’s chief customer officer who also abruptly quit, to take responsibility. “Cathay Pacific is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of ‘one country, two systems,’” the airline said in a statement. The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China. They have swelled since and demands have broadened. Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promised wide-ranging freedoms denied to citizens in mainland China. Many in the city believe Beijing has been eroding those freedoms. The tenor of clashes intensified this week. Thousands of flights were cancelled amid ugly scenes at the city’s airport, when protesters set upon men they suspected were Chinese agents. At the downtown park, Friday night’s protest was peaceful as demonstrators, ranging from bankers to a retired nurse, held up posters reading “Power to the People”, while police looked on. In Australia, hundreds turned out in Sydney and Melbourne in support of the Hong Kong protesters, with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporting some scuffles with pro-Beijing demonstrators in Melbourne. Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-Shing, urged people to “love China, love Hong Kong and love yourself” in newspaper advertisements that marked his first comments on the crisis. But Li, 91, and a fixture of Hong Kong business who founded CK Asset Holdings Ltd and chaired CK Hutchison Holdings, stopped short of explicitly backing the Hong Kong government, as many business leaders have done. He made no reference to supporting the government or its embattled leader, Carrie Lam, in the advertisements, which encouraged freedom, tolerance and the rule of law. “I think the government heard the messages from the protesters loud and clear and is diligently racking their brains now for solutions,” Li said. He warned, “The best cause can lead to the worst results.” Reporting by Felix Tam, Donny Kwok, Twinnie Siu and Farah Master in Hong Kong and Jamie Freed in Singapore; Writing by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Tony Munroe, Clarence Fernandez, Kirsten Donovan",https://in.reuters.com/article/hongkong-protests/hong-kong-tycoon-li-ka-shing-urges-love-in-response-to-growing-protests-idINKCN1V6074?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5278,Not for sale: Greenland amid reports Trump planning to buy it,"Commenting on media reports that US President Donald Trump has privately discussed with advisors the idea of buying Greenland, the country's foreign minister Ane Lone Bagger said it is open for business but is not for sale. Meanwhile, former Denmark Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Twitter, ""It has to be an April Fool's joke. Totally out of season.""",Reuters,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Greenland on Friday dismissed the notion that it might be up for sale after reports that U.S. President Donald Trump had privately discussed with his advisers the idea of buying the world’s biggest island. “We are open for business, but we’re not for sale,” Greenland’s foreign minister Ane Lone Bagger told Reuters. Trump is due to visit Copenhagen in September and the Arctic will be on the agenda during meetings with the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. Talk of a Greenland purchase was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that the notion had been laughed off by some advisers as a joke but was taken more seriously by others in the White House. Danish politicians on Friday poured scorn on the idea. “It has to be an April Fool’s joke. Totally out of season,” former prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Twitter. “If he is truly contemplating this, then this is final proof, that he has gone mad,” foreign affairs spokesman for the Danish People’s Party, Soren Espersen, told broadcaster DR.  “The thought of Denmark selling 50,000 citizens to the United States is completely ridiculous,” he said. Greenland, a self-ruling part of Denmark located between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, is dependant on Danish economic support. It handles its own domestic affairs while Copenhagen looks after defense and foreign policy. “I am sure a majority in Greenland believes it is better to have a relation to Denmark than the United States, in the long term,” Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, Danish MP from Greenland’s second-largest party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), told Reuters. “My immediate thought is ‘No, thank you’,” she said.  Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod were not available for comment but officials said they would respond later on Friday. The U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen was also not immediately available for comment. “Oh dear lord. As someone who loves Greenland, has been there nine times to every corner and loves the people, this is a complete and total catastrophe,” former U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Rufus Gifford, said in on Twitter. Greenland is gaining attention from global super powers including China, Russia and the United States due to its strategic location and its mineral resources. In May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russia was behaving aggressively in the Arctic and China’s actions there had to be watched closely as well. A defense treaty between Denmark and the United States dating back to 1951 gives the U.S. military rights over the  Thule Air Base in northern Greenland. There has been no indication that a Greenland purchase will be on the agenda for Trump’s talks with Danish officials. Martin Lidegaard, senior lawmaker of the Danish Social Liberal Party and a former foreign minister, called the idea “a grotesque proposal” which had no basis in reality. “We are talking about real people and you can’t just sell Greenland like an old colonial power,” he told Reuters.  “But what we can take seriously is that the U.S. stakes and interest in the Arctic is significantly on the rise and they want a much bigger influence,” he added. In 1917 Denmark sold off the then Danish West Indies islands for $25 million to the United States, which renamed them the United States Virgin Islands.

""[They] are true legends...I'm just some bloke trying to bowl off-breaks,"" he added.",Cricket Country,"Nathan Lyon was uncomfortable seeing himself alongside some of Australia’s greatest cricketers after he equalled Dennis Lillee‘s tally of Test wickets on Thursday.Off-spinner Lyon took 3-68, a haul that saw him draw level with celebrated fast bowler Lillee’s tally of 355 Test wickets, as England were dismissed for 258 in their first innings on the second day of the second Ashes Test at Lord’s.That left Lyon equal third in Australia’s all-time list of leading wicket-takers, with only the retired duo of leg-spinner Shane Warne (708) and paceman Glenn McGrath (563) ahead of him.“I’ve always said I am not about personal milestones or personal achievements, it’s about winning Test matches and Test series for Australia,” said Lyon. ALSO READ: Josh Hazlewood stars as Australia dominate England on Day 2 of Lord’s Test“I haven’t really had the time to sit back and think about it,” added the 31-year-old who got to the mark in 88 matches — 18 more than Lillee, who played the last of his 70 Tests in 1984.ASHES 2019 FULL SCHEDULE | ASHES 2019 LATEST NEWSThe often outspoken Lyon, who prior to Australia’s 4-0 2017/18 home series win in the last Ashes campaign said he hoped the team could “end the careers” of several England players, has rarely given the impression of lacking confidence. ALSO READ: Aleem Dar equals Steve Bucknor’s record as he officiates in 128th TestBut he insisted he felt awkward with the company he was now keeping.“I really struggle to see myself up with the likes of Warne, McGrath, Lillee, it doesn’t sit well with me,” Lyon said.“In my eyes those guys are true legends of the game and I’m just some bloke trying to bowl off breaks and trying to make Australian fans proud of the Australian cricket team.”At stumps, in a match where Wednesday’s first day was washed out without a ball bowled, Australia were 30-1 — 228 runs behind.There was no question that Australia, 1-0 up in the five-match series after their 251-run win in last week’s first Test at Edgbaston — a match where Lyon took 6-49 in the second innings – had enjoyed the better of the day’s play.But they did drop several catches and saw England recover from a woeful 138-6 despite recalled fast bowler Josh Hazlewood (3-58) and new-ball partner Pat Cummins (3-61) also taking three wickets apiece.“I don’t think we have had the best day, if I am being brutally honest,” said Lyon.“Josh Hazlewood was absolutely exceptional and the spell from Pat Cummins after tea really set the tone for us.“For our standards I don’t think we were good enough for long periods of time.“In saying that it’s still a good day for Australia. We haven’t played catch today, we can get better and that’s exciting, but we were still able to bowl England out for 258 on a day one wicket,” he added.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/ashes-2019-im-just-some-bloke-trying-to-bowl-says-nathan-lyon-after-equaling-dennis-lillees-tally-of-test-wickets-880413?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Robert, arrested after the climb, scaled the building with his bare hands and without any equipment. Hong Kong has been witnessing pro-democracy protests by its residents for the past few weeks.",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - French “spiderman” climber Alain Robert scaled a 68-storey skyscraper in Hong Kong on Friday to hoist a flag symbolizing reconciliation between China and the territory as weeks of escalating pro-democracy protests show no signs of abating.  Using his bare hands and without a harness, Robert clambered up Cheung Kong Center located in the central business district and secured a large banner on the building’s exterior. The sign positioned China’s flag in the left hand corner with Hong Kong’s flag on the right side. Underneath was a yellow hand shaking a red hand on a white background to signify peace.  Robert’s climb comes as more mass demonstrations are expected through the weekend. China has likened the protests to terrorism and warned it could use force to quell them, as U.S. President Donald Trump urged President Xi Jinping to meet with protesters to defuse weeks of tension.   It was the third time Robert climbed the Center, which is owned by Cheung Kong Holdings (1113.HK). He was banned from climbing buildings in the former British colony for a year last August. His ban ended two weeks ago. Dressed in bright hues of purple, pink and green, Robert was arrested after the climb and taken to a nearby police station.    He often climbs without permission and has been arrested several times, sometimes for trespassing. Li Ka Shing, whose family owns the Cheung Kong Centre, published a series of advertisements in Hong Kong’s major newspapers on Friday urging people to stop the violence. Ten weeks of confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, and have presented the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jingping since he came to power in 2012. The protests began in opposition to a now-suspended bill that would have allowed the extradition of suspects for trial in mainland China, but have swelled into wider calls for democracy. More than 700 people have been arrested since the protests began in June, and tear gas has frequently been used by police in attempts to disperse protests across the city.

India’s decision to revoke special status for its portion of Kashmir, along with a communications blackout and curbs on movement, caused fury in Pakistan, which cut trade and transport links and expelled India’s envoy in retaliation. In London, protesters carried banners saying “Kashmir is Burning”, “Free Kashmir” and “Modi: Make Tea Not War”, according to a Reuters reporter. A small counter-demonstration was kept apart from the main protest by the police. Four people were arrested for affray, obstruction of police and possession of an offensive weapon, police said. “One person was injured during the demonstrations,” they said. A Reuters photograph showed police carrying away a large curved knife from the protest. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered an Independence Day speech on Thursday that spotlighted his decision to remove the special rights of Kashmir among the bold moves of his second term.  Many of the London protesters had come to the capital from other English cities on specially chartered buses. “We want to show our solidarity with our Kashmiri brothers,” said Amin Tahir, a British pensioner of Kashmiri origin who came from Birmingham on one of the coaches. “Since 1947 Kashmir has been struggling to be free from India.

Shri Amit Shah
North Block,
New Delhi 110001Dear sir,I am left with no other option but to write to you since I’ve made several unsuccessful attempts to get a degree of clarity on my detention. Hope and pray that I am not punished/penalised or arrested for raising questions about my fundamental rights.Kashmir is engulfed in clouds of darkness and I fear for the safety of its people including those who spoke up. We Kashmiris are reeling in despair since the unilateral abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019. My mother, Ms. Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir was detained along with scores of other elected representatives the very same day.It’s now been over ten long agonising days since this crippling curfew was imposed. The valley is gripped with fear because all forms of communications have been snapped thereby debilitating an entire population. Today while the rest of the country celebrates India’s Independence Day, Kashmiris have been caged like animals and deprived of basic human rights.Unfortunately, for reasons best known to you, I also have been placed under detention at my residence. We are not even told when visitors are turned away from the gate and I am not allowed to step out either. Odd, since I am not affiliated to any political party and have always been a law abiding citizen.However, the security personnel have cited my interviews to various media portals and newspapers as the reason for my detention. In fact, I’ve been threatened with dire consequences if I speak up again.Also watch: Video by Fact-Finding Team Shows Unanimous Anger Against Centre in KashmirPertinent to mention that the recurrent theme of these interviews was unconstitutional abrogation of the Article 370 followed by an unprecedented curfew. I also expressed concern for my mother’s safety, who along with hundreds of political detainees have been jailed since August 5, 2019.With due respect, I fail to understand why I am being punished for speaking on behalf on Kashmiris whose voices have been smothered. Is it a crime to articulate the pain, torment and indignity we’ve been subjected to?Does it warrant a detention to describe our plight? I’d be most obliged If you could kindly throw light on the laws under which I’ve been detained and for how long? Do I need to seek legal recourse?It’s suffocating and humiliating to be treated in this manner. I have to grovel for permission to allow my aged grandmother to visit her son. Is she also a potential threat?For the world’s largest democracy, doesn’t a citizen not have a right to speak up in the face of unimaginable repression? Satyamev jayate i.e. truth only triumphs has defined the spirit of our country and it’s constitution. It’s a tragic irony that I am being treated like a war criminal for stating the inconvenient truth.Apologies for not posting this letter but as you’re aware postal services in Jammu and Kashmir have been suspended.May truth prevail.Regards,

5310,N Korea rejects South's pledge to unite the two Koreas by 2045,"North Korea has rejected South Korean President Moon Jae-in's pledge to achieve the unification between North and South Korea by 2045. Stating that inter-Korean talks are over, North Korea said the loss of dialogue momentum was entirely the responsibility of South Korea. North Korea also launched at least two missiles into the sea on Friday.",Reuters,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea launched at least two short-range ballistic missiles on Friday, South Korea’s military said, shortly after Pyongyang described South Korea’s president as “impudent” and vowed that inter-Korean talks are over. The North has protested against joint U.S.-South Korea military drills, largely computer-simulated, which kicked off last week, calling them a rehearsal for war. It has also fired several short-range missiles in recent weeks. North Korea fired two more short-range projectiles into the sea off its east coast on Friday morning, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.  Japan’s defense ministry said it did not see any imminent security threat from the latest projectile launch.   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said initial information indicated at least one projectile was fired by North Korea and appeared to be similar to the short-range missiles fired in previous weeks. Another official said the United States was consulting with South Korea and Japan. An official at Seoul’s defense ministry said the latest test involved ballistic technology and detailed analysis was under way with the United States with the possibility that the North fired the same type of missiles it used on Aug. 10. The missiles were launched shortly after 8 a.m. Friday (2300 GMT Thursday) and flew around 230 kms (142 miles) to an altitude of 30 kms (18 miles), South Korea’s JCS said.  The launches have complicated attempts to restart talks between U.S. and North Korean negotiators over the future of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Those denuclearization talks have been stalled despite a commitment to revive them made at a June 30 meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Earlier on Friday, Pyongyang rejected a vow by South Korean President Moon Jae-in a day earlier to pursue talks with the North and to unify the two Koreas by 2045.  The loss of dialogue momentum between the North and South and the stalemate in implementing pledges made at an historic summit between their two leaders last year was entirely the responsibility of the South, a North Korean spokesman said. The unidentified spokesman repeated criticism that the joint U.S.-South Korea drills were a sign of Seoul’s hostility toward the North. “We have nothing to talk any more with the South Korean authorities nor have any idea to sit with them again,” the North’s spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. The committee manages relationships with the South. The rival Koreas are technically still at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce rather than a peace treaty. South Korea’s unification ministry called North Korea’s comments about Moon “not in line” with inter-Korean agreements and unhelpful for developing relations between them.  After an emergency meeting of South Korea’s National Security Council held to discuss the launches, officials reiterated that the joint drills are simply an opportunity to evaluate whether South Korea could eventually assume wartime control of the allied forces on the peninsula. Moon and Kim have met three times since April last year, pledging peace and cooperation, but little progress has been made to improve dialogue and strengthen exchanges and cooperation.  “North Korea makes it exceedingly difficult to build trust when it interprets restraint as weakness and looks to exploit divisions within South Korea,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.  Seoul and Washington should continue to seek working-level talks with North Korea but the allies should also prepare new sanctions and renewed military cooperation if Pyongyang continues to violate United Nations resolutions and threaten its neighbors, Easley said. The South’s Moon said in a Liberation Day address on Thursday it was only through his policy of Korean national peace that dialogue with the North was still possible. “In spite of a series of worrying actions taken by North Korea recently, the momentum for dialogue remains unshaken,” Moon said in a speech marking Korea’s independence from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule.  The North’s spokesman described Moon as an “impudent guy” who is “overcome with fright”. He said Moon had no standing to talk about engagement with the North because of the ongoing military maneuvers. “His open talk about ‘dialogue’ between the North and the South under such a situation raises a question as to whether he has proper thinking faculty,” the spokesman said. It was “senseless” to think that inter-Korean dialogue would resume once the military drills with the United States were over, he said. However, the spokesman left open the possibility of talks with the United States.  Trump and Kim have met twice since their first summit in Singapore last year and said their countries would continue talks. However, little progress has been made on the North’s stated commitment to denuclearize.

5311,Trump asks advisors if it's possible for US to buy Greenland: Report,"US President Donald Trump has privately discussed with aides and advisors the idea of the US purchasing the island of Greenland from Denmark as a way to expand the country's territory, according to a report. Trump will visit Denmark early in September. In 1946, the then US President Harry Truman had offered to buy Greenland for $100 million.",Reuters,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Greenland on Friday dismissed the notion that it might be up for sale after reports that U.S. President Donald Trump had privately discussed with his advisers the idea of buying the world’s biggest island. “We are open for business, but we’re not for sale,” Greenland’s foreign minister Ane Lone Bagger told Reuters. Trump is due to visit Copenhagen in September and the Arctic will be on the agenda during meetings with the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. Talk of a Greenland purchase was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that the notion had been laughed off by some advisers as a joke but was taken more seriously by others in the White House. Danish politicians on Friday poured scorn on the idea. “It has to be an April Fool’s joke. Totally out of season,” former prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Twitter. “If he is truly contemplating this, then this is final proof, that he has gone mad,” foreign affairs spokesman for the Danish People’s Party, Soren Espersen, told broadcaster DR.  “The thought of Denmark selling 50,000 citizens to the United States is completely ridiculous,” he said. Greenland, a self-ruling part of Denmark located between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, is dependant on Danish economic support. It handles its own domestic affairs while Copenhagen looks after defense and foreign policy. “I am sure a majority in Greenland believes it is better to have a relation to Denmark than the United States, in the long term,” Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, Danish MP from Greenland’s second-largest party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), told Reuters. “My immediate thought is ‘No, thank you’,” she said.  Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod were not available for comment but officials said they would respond later on Friday. The U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen was also not immediately available for comment. “Oh dear lord. As someone who loves Greenland, has been there nine times to every corner and loves the people, this is a complete and total catastrophe,” former U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Rufus Gifford, said in on Twitter. Greenland is gaining attention from global super powers including China, Russia and the United States due to its strategic location and its mineral resources. In May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russia was behaving aggressively in the Arctic and China’s actions there had to be watched closely as well. A defense treaty between Denmark and the United States dating back to 1951 gives the U.S. military rights over the  Thule Air Base in northern Greenland. There has been no indication that a Greenland purchase will be on the agenda for Trump’s talks with Danish officials. Martin Lidegaard, senior lawmaker of the Danish Social Liberal Party and a former foreign minister, called the idea “a grotesque proposal” which had no basis in reality. “We are talking about real people and you can’t just sell Greenland like an old colonial power,” he told Reuters.  “But what we can take seriously is that the U.S. stakes and interest in the Arctic is significantly on the rise and they want a much bigger influence,” he added. In 1917 Denmark sold off the then Danish West Indies islands for $25 million to the United States, which renamed them the United States Virgin Islands.

5312,Trump urges China Prez Jinping to meet Hong Kong protestors,"Amid protests in Hong Kong, US President Donald Trump has urged his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to meet the protestors. ""He'd work it out in 15 minutes...I know it's not the kind of thing he does, but I think it wouldn't be a bad idea,"" Trump said. Trump also said he would not want to see China violently suppressing protestors.",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong braced for more mass protests over the weekend, even as China warned it could use its power to quell demonstrations and U.S. President Donald Trump urged his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to meet with the protesters to defuse weeks of tensions. Hundreds of China’s People’s Armed Police (PAP) on Thursday conducted exercises at a sports stadium in Shenzhen that borders Hong Kong a day after the U.S. State Department said it was “deeply concerned” about the movements, which have prompted worries that the troops could be used to break up protests. Trump told reporters on Thursday he did not want to see a resort to violence to quell the protests in Hong Kong and reiterated that he wanted to see China “humanely solve the problem.” “I am concerned. I wouldn’t want to see a violent crackdown,” Trump said, speaking in Morristown, New Jersey. “If he (Xi) sat down with the protesters - a group of representative protesters - I’d bet he’d work it out in 15 minutes. ... I know it’s not the kind of thing he does, but I think it wouldn’t be a bad idea.” Trump said he had a call with Xi scheduled “soon.” Ten weeks of confrontations between police and protesters have plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, and have presented the biggest popular challenge to Xi in his seven years in power. The Civil Human Rights Front, which organized million-strong marches in June, has scheduled another protest for Sunday. China’s ambassador to London warned that Beijing could use its power to quell the Hong Kong protests if the situation deteriorated further and repeating charges that some protesters had shown “signs of terrorism.” “The central government will not sit on its hands and watch,” the ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, told reporters. “We have enough solutions and enough power within the limits of (the) Basic Law to quell any unrest swiftly,” Liu said, referring to Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, which states that the Hong Kong government can ask the Chinese garrison in the city to help maintain order. “The central government of China will never allow a few violent offenders to drag Hong Kong down a dangerous road, down a dangerous abyss,” Liu said.  The Friday edition of China’s state-controlled Global Times tabloid also warned that China had the option to “forcefully intervene” and lashed out at what Beijing describes as U.S. interference in Hong Kong. “If Hong Kong cannot restore the rule of law on its own and the riots intensify, it’s imperative then for the central government to take direct actions based on the Basic Law,” it said, saying the Shenzhen PAP deployment was “a clear warning.” The paper said the situation in Hong Kong “won’t be a repeat of the June 4th political incident in 1989,” referring to the bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square 30 years ago. White House national security adviser John Bolton warned against a repeat of Tiananmen in an interview on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Trump tied a U.S. trade deal with China to a humane resolution of the protests. Trump has been seeking a major deal to correct trade imbalances with China ahead of his 2020 re-election bid and has faced criticism from Congress and elsewhere for not taking a stronger public line on Hong Kong and for his characterization of the protests earlier this month as “riots” that were a matter for China to deal with. Trump’s tougher stance on Hong Kong followed a debate within his administration over whether Washington was looking too compliant while China appeared to be preparing for a crackdown, a source familiar with the deliberations said. On Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing had noted Trump’s comment that Beijing needed to resolve the Hong Kong crisis on its own. Western governments have stepped up calls for restraint following chaotic scenes at Hong Kong’s airport this week that forced cancellation of nearly 1,000 flights and saw protesters set upon two men they suspected of being government sympathizers. France called on city officials to renew talks with activists, while Canada said China should handle the protests with tact. Two opposition lawmakers from Hong Kong visiting the United States on Thursday urged the outside world to stay focused on developments. “For the international community to speak up for Hong Kong is extremely important, and we see that across the American political establishment,” Dennis Kwok of the liberal-democratic Civic Party said at the Asia Society thinktank in New York. He and fellow party member Alvin Yeung were to meet with U.S. lawmakers. The airport, one of the world’s busiest, was returning to normal on Thursday but under tight security after thousands of protesters jammed its halls on Monday and Tuesday nights. Late on Wednesday night, police and protesters faced off again on the streets, with riot officers quickly firing tear gas.  Seventeen people were arrested on Wednesday, bringing the total detained since June to 748, police told a news conference, adding that police stations have been surrounded and attacked 76 times during the crisis. Despite the Shenzhen deployments, several Western and Asian diplomats in Hong Kong said they believed China had little appetite for putting its forces onto Hong Kong’s streets, and    a U.S. official said on Wednesday the PAP activities appeared aimed at intimidating the protesters. The U.S. State Department warned on Wednesday that continued erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy put at risk the preferential economic status it enjoys under U.S. law and leading members of the U.S. Congress have warned that a crackdown could be met by U.S. sanctions. Research firm Capital Economics said the protests could push Hong Kong into a recession and risked “an even worse outcome if a further escalation triggers capital flight.” Hong Kong’s property market, one of the world’s most expensive, would be hit hard in that scenario, it added. Financial Secretary Paul Chan unveiled a series of measures worth HK$19.1 billion ($2.44 billion) on Thursday to tackle economic headwinds, but he said it was not related to political pressure from the protests.  Some business and citizens’ groups have posted newspaper advertisements backing Hong Kong’s government. The head of Macau casino operator Galaxy Entertainment (0027.HK), Lui Che-woo, urged talks to restore harmony. The protests have affected the neighboring Chinese territory of Macau, with some visitors avoiding the world’s biggest gambling hub amid transport disruptions and safety concerns.

It added it is not looking at handing out any NOCs to other players for playing in foreign T20 leagues. ""We discussed the matter, but felt no action is required to be taken,"" a CoA member said.",CricTracker,"Yuvraj Singh recently announced retirement from all forms of cricket and soon requested the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to grant the NOC to play in the foreign T20 leagues. Accordingly, he featured in the Global T20 Canada’s second edition which recently concluded and led the Toronto Nationals. The move had relieved many former Indian cricketers as they also hoped to play in foreign leagues.But the Committee of Administrators (CoA) has cleared that Yuvraj’s case was an exception and no other Indian cricketer will be permitted to play in the leagues other than the IPL. The southpaw though rolled back the clock with his batting at times in the tournament even as Manpreet Gony was the other Indian cricketer to play in the league.Advertisement“What happened in Yuvraj’s case was a one-off and we aren’t looking at handing out any NOCs at present for playing in foreign leagues. We discussed the matter, but felt no action is required to be taken on the issue,” a CoA member was quoted as saying by Latestly.However, the BCCI officials are left surprised with this CoA’s move. They feel that there should be some consistency and all the players should be treated equally. “There is something called consistency, but clearly not under the current administration in the board. Arbitrary decision making isn’t the way when it comes to players and their careers.“There might be quite a few former players who are no longer part of the scheme of things when it comes to the Indian team who would have thought of retiring and playing in T20 leagues. This sudden U-turn is unfair on them,” one of the officials said. Another official was of the opinion that if a player is retiring from the game, then he/she shouldn’t be allowed to play anywhere in the world.“To be honest, you don’t retire geographically. You either retire or you don’t. If some country is permitting retired players to play in T20 leagues, that is an ICC issue. The ICC wishes to be ignorant on such issues.

5345,Will take 'necessary countermeasures' against latest US tariffs: China,"China said on Thursday that it will take ""necessary countermeasures"" against the 10% tariffs imposed on $300 billion Chinese imports by the US from September 1. It added that the tariffs ""seriously violated the consensus"" between the two countries. Trump, on Tuesday, postponed the tariffs on some Chinese goods till December 15 to avoid impact on shoppers ahead of Christmas.",Reuters,"MORRISTOWN, N.J. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators were holding “productive” trade talks and expected them to meet in September despite U.S. tariffs on over $125 billion worth of Chinese imports taking effect Sept 1. “September, the meeting is still on as I understand it, but I think more importantly than September, we’re talking by phone, and we’re having very productive talks,” Trump told reporters in New Jersey. He said U.S. and Chinese officials had “a very good conversation” earlier this week, before his administration delayed until Dec. 15 tariffs on over $150 billion in Chinese imports, including toys, cell phones, and laptop and tablet computers. Nonetheless, China on Thursday vowed to counter the latest U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods but called on the United States to meet it halfway on a potential trade deal. Trump said he did not think Beijing would retaliate for the U.S. tariffs and that he believes China wants to make a trade deal. “I think we’re having very good discussions with China. They very much want to make a deal,” Trump told reporters. He said he had a call scheduled soon with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but he did not say when.   “I think the longer it goes the stronger we get,” Trump said of the trade war. “I have a feeling it’s going to go fairly short,” he said. The Chinese finance ministry said in a statement that Washington’s tariffs violated a consensus reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a June summit in Japan to resolve their disputes via negotiation.  In a separate statement, China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said, “We hope the U.S. will meet China halfway, and implement the consensus of the two heads of the two countries in Osaka.”  China hopes to find mutually acceptable solutions through dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respect, she added.  Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020 and had made the economy and his tough stance on China a key part of his 2016 campaign for the White House, on Thursday said any agreement must meet U.S. demands.  “China, frankly, would love to make a deal, and it’s got to be a deal on proper terms. It’s got to be a deal, frankly, on our terms. Otherwise, what’s the purpose?” Trump said in an interview on New Hampshire radio station WGIR.   China will resolutely counter any provocation to the end, the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily wrote in a commentary on Friday.  “By the looks of it, they know they will hit a brick wall in a cul-de-sac at some point, so now they are but slowing their pace and delaying the hit,” the People’s Daily wrote.  “By not turning back, they will ultimately hit the wall and break their heads.” The trade picture is further complicated by continuing unrest in Hong Kong. Trump on Wednesday tied the situation to any possible agreement, saying Xi must first resolve the issues in the territory with protesters. On Thursday, he used Twitter to call on the Chinese president to personally meet with protesters to spur “a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem.” Trump and Xi in June had agreed to restart trade talks after negotiations stalled earlier this year. But earlier this month, the Trump administration said it would slap duties beginning Sept. 1 on $300 billion of Chinese goods, which would effectively cover all of China’s exports to the United States. He said the partial delay to Dec. 15 for about half the list was aimed at sparing retailers and consumers pain during the Christmas selling season. The tariff plan has roiled global markets and further unnerved investors as the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies stretches into its second year with no end in sight.

5352,Subtitler accuses '2.0' producers of non-payment of dues,"A subtitler named Rekhs has alleged that Lyca Productions, which produced Rajinikanth starrer '2.0', is yet to clear her dues. Rekhs had done the subtitles for the film in two languages - Tamil and Telugu. She further claimed that although it has been almost 8 months that the film released, the producers haven't been responding to her calls or emails.",The News Minute,"Rajinikanth's 2.0 directed by Shankar, was released on November 29, 2018. However, the person who did the subtitles for the film, Rekhs, a well-known name in the field, has alleged that Lyca Productions is yet to clear her dues for the work done. Rekhs had done the subtitles for 2.0 in two languages – Tamil and Telugu.Though it's been months since the film released, she claims that not only has Lyca not made the payment to her team, they haven't been responding to her phone calls or emails. Apart from Rekhs, two others from her team also worked on the film, and allegedly none of them has been paid. This is why she took the issue to Twitter on Monday.Speaking to TNM, Rekhs says, ""By and large, small budget films especially are very prompt. They even give me an advance and pay the day I send the work for censor. So, I do not want the outside world to get the wrong image that our industry is like this. I had no other option but to go public, because Lyca was silent. Courtesy demands that you reply, right? I trusted them in good faith.”Adding that she has worked in the field for 10 long years, with grueling work hours like 6 am to 2 am when subtitling work has to be completed, Rekhs says it's unfair she's being treated this way. Contracts are not normally issued for subtitling work, she says, so what she sent Lyca was a job letter as is usual procedure. The letter was sent on October 5 and the film released nearly two months later.On Twitter, Rekhs had also alleged that she was not paid for Enthiran (produced by Sun Pictures) either.can @LycaProductions pls let me know when my team & i will be paid for #2pointO we handed over all reels, both langs in good faith, trusting u won't let us dwn. Sadly my last resort but i strongly feel cast & crew shd b paid. i cn u/s delay but not this silence 2my calls/mail when i went to sun pictures and askd them to pay me for #enthiran they said they will verify and get bk. i am still waiting!! dir shankar was such a gentleman, he apologized to me (he need not at all) ensured i was paid before i even delivered subs for #nanban! #Respect  https://t.co/rYD08NiHet""As far as Enthiran goes, my husband and I went to their office and asked them. We had to meet so many people and finally one man came to us and said they'll verify and let us know if what we're saying was true. That really irritated us. Why would we go there and pretend to be people who've done subtitles if we haven't? So we just left it as a bad joke and came away,"" she says, sounding exhausted. Rekhs is currently working on the subtitling work for Comali, which is due to hit the screens on Thursday.The availability of subtitles expands a film's reach. Thanks to Rekhs's work, several Indian films have won an international audience. When she tweeted that Lyca had not paid her, support came pouring in from other social media users who pointed out that 2.0 had reached even Gary Whitta, the writer of Star Wars Rogue One and Walking Dead, because of the power of subtitles.Because of @rekhshc subtitles #2point0 reached the writer of Star Wars Rogue One and Walking Dead. This is the power of subtitles! And now I learn @LycaProductions has not paid her team for their work? https://t.co/MSYkVOIR7R""Subtitles help a film transcend language and latitude, and I believe I have to do my squirrel bit to bridge the gap and show the world out there that we're in no way inferior to Bollywood. It isn't some hobby or job for me. It's my life. I walk, talk and breathe subs!"" says Rekhs.She further notes that she does not want to involve Shankar or Rajinikanth in the issue and that it's only between her and Lyca.Rekhs says Lyca has not contacted her yet. TNM has reached out to Lyca for a response and this story will be updated if and when they respond.Also read: When dreams turn to dust: How Kollywood exploits labour",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/trusted-them-good-faith-subtitlist-rekhs-alleges-lyca-hasnt-paid-her-20-107210?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5359,How many trips would Indians take if they take up PM's challenge?,"PM Narendra Modi today urged every Indian to visit 15 domestic tourist destinations over the next three years even if they lack good hotels and other amenities. If everyone takes up his challenge, there would be 6.84 billion trips a year. That compares to 1.8 billion domestic tourism trips by Indians last year, according to a Google and Bain report.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday came up with one idea to get India’s stuttering economy humming again - get every Indian to visit 15 domestic tourist destinations over the next three years. The proposal might help to pump up domestic travel, which has struggled as many Indians cut back on consumer spending, and it could also create badly-needed jobs. But it left some in the travel industry scratching their heads over how India’s far from fully developed transport and tourism infrastructure could cope if many of its 1.25 billion people took Modi up on his challenge.  “By 2022, before India celebrates its 75th year of independence, I would like to request that all of you should travel to at least 15 local tourist destinations,” Modi said in his Independence Day speech. If everyone did it there would be 18.75 billion trips, or 6.25 billion a year. That compared to 1.8 billion domestic tourism trips by Indians last year, according to an April report by Google and consultancy firm Bain. Local trips by domestic travellers have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of around 8% in the last four years, the report said.  “The main issue is beyond that of infrastructure at trains stations and airports,” said Imtiaz Qureshi, of the Travel Agents Association of India, who runs his own travel agency in Hyderabad. “It is the last mile connectivity to remote tourist destinations.”  Although Modi’s government has made great efforts to build new roads to link towns and villages, and improve railway services, as well as expand existing airports and construct new ones, it still has a long way to go.  Qureshi said the incremental costs of travel to remote areas without sufficient infrastructure can soon add up and make foreign travel to places such as Malaysia seem cheaper and easier. Modi, to be sure, did not promise the travel would be easy, saying people should pledge to visit these destinations even if they lack good hotels and other amenities. It would be “for the sake of employment of the local youth,” he said, adding that once people started traveling, basic amenities would spring up. Modi himself has been an avid traveller, visiting many remote parts of the country as a young ascetic after he left home, books about him say.

A multi-pronged approach adopted by the government to curtail cross-border infiltration is giving positive results,"" the Governor said.Malik assured that regional identity of Jammu and Kashmir people is not at stake with the abrogation of Article 370.""The Indian Constitution allows many regional identities to thrive and prosper. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, one can witness a wide range of religions, languages, cultures and societies. Thus, one should not get worried thinking that their identity will be lost with the measures taken by the Centre. In the new scenario, Kashmiri, Balti, Dogri, Gojri, Pahari, Sheena and other languages will have the opportunity to thrive as well as various tribes and castes in the region will get proper representation,"" he said.The Governor said the changes brought out by the Centre are not just historic but have opened new vistas of development for the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.""For the past 70 years, people of Jammu and Kashmir have been distracted by the core issues of economic development, peace and prosperity. People have been misled towards baseless issues. It is surprising that in public discourse there was no focus on issues of ""roti, kapda aur makaan,"" he said. ""This step will promote good governance, enhance job opportunities and bring a feeling of belonging and oneness amongst the residents of Jammu and Kashmir, with the rest of the country"".The Independence Day the celebration comes just weeks after the Centre scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status by repealing Article 370.Security was heightened in the area after the Centre withdrew the special status and passed the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganization) Act, 2019, bifurcating it into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir with legislature and Ladakh without it.

The investigation didn't confirm a direct link between the Chinese government or Huawei executives.",TechCrunch,"A new report from The Wall Street Journal could be another damning piece of evidence for a company already under a good deal of international scrutiny. The paper is reporting that technicians working for Huawei helped members of government in Uganda and Zambia spy on political opponents. The report cites unnamed senior surveillance officers. The paper adds that an investigation didn’t confirm a direct tie between the Chinese government or Huawei executives. It did, however, appear to confirm that employees for the tech giant played a part in intercepting communications. The list includes encrypted messages, the use of apps like WhatsApp and Skype and tracking opponents using cellular data. A representative for Zambia’s ruling party confirmed with the paper that Huawei technicians have helped in the fight against news sites with opposing stances in the country, stating, “Whenever we want to track down perpetrators of fake news, we ask Zicta, which is the lead agency. They work with Huawei to ensure that people don’t use our telecommunications space to spread fake news.” Huawei has, naturally, denied any involvement, stating that it has “never been engaged in ‘hacking’ activities. Huawei rejects completely these unfounded and inaccurate allegations against our business operations. Our internal investigation shows clearly that Huawei and its employees have not been engaged in any of the activities alleged.

5381,Swiss startup Energy Vault raises $110 mn from SoftBank Vision Fund,"Switzerland-based startup Energy Vault has raised $110 million in Series B funding from SoftBank Vision Fund. Founded in 2017, the startup's prototype shows a moving tower made of cement bricks, each weighing 35 metric tons. The movement of these massive blocks is powered by wind or solar power plants and is a way to store the energy those plants generate.",TechCrunch,"Imagine a moving tower made of huge cement bricks weighing 35 metric tons. The movement of these massive blocks is powered by wind or solar power plants and is a way to store the energy those plants generate. Software controls the movement of the blocks automatically, responding to changes in power availability across an electric grid to charge and discharge the power that’s being generated.The development of this technology is the culmination of years of work at Idealab,  the Pasadena, Calif.-based startup incubator, and Energy Vault, the company it spun out to commercialize the technology, has just raised $110 million from SoftBank  Vision Fund to take its next steps in the world.Energy storage remains one of the largest obstacles to the large-scale rollout of renewable energy technologies on utility grids, but utilities, development agencies and private companies are investing billions to bring new energy storage capabilities to market as the technology to store energy improves.The investment in Energy Vault is just one indicator of the massive market that investors see coming as power companies spend billions on renewables and storage. As The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend, ScottishPower, the U.K.-based utility, is committing to spending $7.2 billion on renewable energy, grid upgrades and storage technologies between 2018 and 2022.Meanwhile, out in the wilds of Utah, the American subsidiary of Japan’s Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems is working on a joint venture that would create the world’s largest clean energy storage facility. That 1 gigawatt storage would go a long way toward providing renewable power to the Western U.S. power grid and is going to be based on compressed air energy storage, large flow batteries, solid oxide fuel cells and renewable hydrogen storage.“For 20 years, we’ve been reducing carbon emissions of the U.S. power grid using natural gas in combination with renewable power to replace retiring coal-fired power generation. In California and other states in the western United States, which will soon have retired all of their coal-fired power generation, we need the next step in decarbonization. Mixing natural gas and storage, and eventually using 100% renewable storage, is that next step,” said Paul Browning, president and CEO of MHPS Americas.Energy Vault’s technology could also be used in these kinds of remote locations, according to chief executive Robert Piconi.Energy Vault’s storage technology certainly isn’t going to be ubiquitous in highly populated areas, but the company’s towers of blocks can work well in remote locations and have a lower cost than chemical storage options, Piconi said.“What you’re seeing there on some of the battery side is the need in the market for a mobile solution that isn’t tied to topography,” Piconi said. “We obviously aren’t putting these systems in urban areas or the middle of cities.”For areas that need larger-scale storage that’s a bit more flexible there are storage solutions like Tesla’s new Megapack.Tesla has a new energy product called MegapackThe Megapack comes fully assembled — including battery modules, bi-directional inverters, a thermal management system, an AC breaker and controls — and can store up to 3 megawatt-hours of energy with a 1.5 megawatt inverter capacity.The Energy Vault storage system is made for much, much larger storage capacity. Each tower can store between 20 and 80 megawatt hours at a cost of 6 cents per kilowatt hour (on a levelized cost basis), according to Piconi.The first facility that Energy Vault is developing is a 35 megawatt-hour system in Northern Italy, and there are other undisclosed contracts with an undisclosed number of customers on four continents, according to the company.One place where Piconi sees particular applicability for Energy Vault’s technology is around desalination plants in places like sub-Saharan Africa or desert areas.Backing Energy Vault’s new storage technology are a clutch of investors, including Neotribe Ventures, Cemex Ventures, Idealab and SoftBank.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/14/energy-vault-raises-110-million-from-softbank-vision-fund-as-energy-storage-grabs-headlines/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The bounce can be inconsistent. Some of the pitches can be on the quicker side too. So you got to adapt,” he said. “They defeated England at home in a Test series last year.

Tendulkar, who was just 17 at that time, played a brilliant knock of 119 against England at the Old Trafford in Manchester and saved the match for India. In that game, England skipper Graham Gooch and his opening partner Mike Atherton had each scored a century as they posted a mammoth first inning total of 519.The Kapil Dev-led side gave a strong reply as they managed to score 432 runs in the first innings, conceding a 87-run lead. Tendulkar contributed with 68 during the course of this inning. In the second innings, England declared their second innings at 320/4, putting up a target of 408 for India. India started their chase on a poor note, losing their top order inside 110 runs. At one stage, India were 127/5 and with almost two sessions remaining, it looked unlikely that India could sustain much resistance. However, Tendulkar had other plans as he struck 17 boundaries in his 189-ball knock to help India reach 343/6 at the end of day's play. Although it ended in a draw, the match provided the cricket world with a glimpse of what they were about to witness from this great prodigy in the years to come. Tendulkar, in his international career that extended for more than two decades, scored 100 centuries (51 in Tests and 49 in ODIs) -- a record that remains unbroken till date. ",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/sachin-tendulkars-first-international-hundred-when-master-blaster-announced-himself-on-world-stage/468904?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5454,"A$AP Rocky found guilty of assault in Sweden, gets suspended sentence","American rapper A$AP Rocky has been found guilty of assault in Sweden and given a two-year suspended sentence over a fight in Stockholm in June. ""The assault has not been of such a serious nature that a prison sentence must be chosen,"" the court said. Rocky and two other defendants had claimed they had acted in self-defence against two men.",Reuters,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - U.S. rapper A$AP Rocky was convicted in Sweden on Wednesday of assault over a Stockholm street brawl, but spared time in jail after a high-profile trial that had led President Donald Trump to accuse Sweden of treating him unfairly. A$AP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, and two members of his entourage were found guilty of kicking and beating 19-year-old Mustafa Jafari after an argument. But the court said allegations they hit him with a glass bottle, which might have brought a tougher sentence, were not proven. “In an overall assessment, the court finds that the assault has not been of such a serious nature that a prison sentence must be chosen,” Senior Judge Per Lennerbrant told a courtroom packed with reporters. In a comment posted on Instagram, Mayers said he was disappointed with the verdict and that it had been a difficult time. “Imma keep moving forward,” he said. “Thank you to my team, my management, attorneys, label and everyone who advocated for justice.” The rapper, who shot to fame with his 2011 debut “Live.Love.A$AP”, was not court for the verdict. He was released on Aug. 2 after 31 days in jail and a three-day trial, in what legal experts said at the time was a sign the judge was likely not to jail him further. The court said the fact that the defendants had no prior convictions over the past five years and had already spent time in custody awaiting trial meant they would not serve further time in prison or pay any fine. Prosecutor Daniel Suneson told Reuters he had not yet decided whether he would appeal any part of the verdict. “The court has been of the same view as myself, with one big exception, which is whether or not a blow was dealt with a glass bottle,” he said. “Beyond that I feel the court made an accurate assessment.” Slobodan Jovicic, Mayers’ Swedish lawyer, told reporters that despite the verdict, the court had ruled in favour of his client regarding some aspects of the case. “We didn’t succeed all the way but on the other hand we got many points proven,” he said, adding that he had contacted his client about the verdict via text message and would speak to him later on Wednesday.  SELF-DEFENCE The case drew global attention, particularly after Trump offered to vouch for the rapper’s bail and asked Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven to help free him. Sweden does not have a bail system and Lofven pointed to Sweden’s independent judiciary saying he could not intervene. Trump tweeted messages saying he was disappointed in Lofven and demanding: “Treat Americans fairly!” Other celebrities, including Kim Kardashian and Rod Stewart, had also spoken out in support of the rapper.  During the trial, both the defence and prosecution made liberal use of video taken on mobile phones during the altercation. The prosecution said that after an argument, Mayers threw Jafari to the ground, after which he and the two others kicked and punched the teenager.  Mayers said he acted in self defence after the teenager attacked his bodyguard. The court said it had been proven that the artist and two of his party had hit and kicked the plaintiff as he lay on the ground, and discounted their claims of self-defence.  Mayers, best known for his song “Praise the Lord”, had been in Stockholm for a concert at the time of the fight. He had to cancel several shows across Europe due to his detention. He is due in neighbouring Finland on August 16 to play the Blockfest festival in Tampere.

Quoirin, who had the neurological disorder holoprosencephaly, had gone missing from a resort where she was on a holiday with her family. Her body was found in a ravine, about 2.5 km from the resort.",Reuters,"PARIS/SEREMBAN (Reuters) - The Paris prosecutor’s office has opened a criminal probe into the death of an Irish-French girl, whose body was found near a jungle stream in Malaysia, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday.   The remains of Nora Anne Quoirin, 15, were found on Tuesday, 10 days after she went missing from a rainforest resort in Seremban, about 70 km (44 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur..  An autopsy begun on Wednesday morning had yet to conclude, Malaysian police said, adding that forensic pathologists were still working to determine the cause of Quoirin’s death.       The Paris prosecutor had opened a criminal investigation into Quoirin’s case for kidnapping on Aug. 9, a spokeswoman told Reuters in a text message.  French prosecutors regularly launch investigations on cases involving French citizens abroad. Nora’s mother is from Belfast while her father is French.  Malaysia’s Negeri Sembilan state police chief Mohamad Mat Yusop declined to comment on the French probe. Quoirin’s family lawyer Sankara N. Nair had earlier called on Malaysian police to accept an offer by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to help investigate the circumstances of the girl’s death. “It’s a very good proposal. I hope police will accept the assistance,” Nair told Reuters. Quoirin’s naked body was found in a deep ravine, about 2.5 km (1.6 miles) from The Dusun resort, where she had disappeared a day after her family arrived for a holiday there on Aug. 3.   Her family feared a criminal connection to her disappearance, saying she had special needs and had never before left the family voluntarily, a British victims’ group, the Lucie Blackman Trust, said in a statement issued on their behalf.   An initial investigation had yielded no evidence of criminal behaviour but police would look at all possibilities, Malaysia’s deputy police chief Mazlan Mansor said on Tuesday.

5479,6 accused in Pehlu Khan lynching case acquitted by Rajasthan court,"Six accused in the Pehlu Khan lynching case were acquitted by a court in Rajasthan's Alwar on Wednesday. In April 2017, 55-year-old Pehlu Khan and his two sons were transporting cows in a pickup truck from Jaipur. They were passing through Behror when some cow vigilantes allegedly beat them, following which Khan died at a hospital.",The Quint,"The Alwar district court on Wednesday, 14 August, acquitted all six accused in the 2017 Pehlu Khan lynching case on the grounds of “benefit of doubt”.Hours after the verdict, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said the state government will appeal against the verdict delivered by the court of an additional district judge.The six accused let off by the court are Vipin Yadav, Ravindra Kumar, Kaluram, Dayanand, Yogesh Kumar and Bheem Rathi.Apart from the six acquitted by the Alwar court, three others all under 18 -- are still facing a separate inquiry by a juvenile justice board.Pehlu Khan (55), his two sons and a few others were transporting cows from Jaipur when they were allegedly stopped and thrashed by a mob near Behror in Alwar district on April 1, 2017.Later, a video clip surfaced on social media purportedly showing a group of men beating them.While his sons survived, Khan, a resident of Jaisinghpura village in Haryana's Nuh district, died in hospital on 3 April, triggering outrage over the murder.A CNN News18 report had earlier said that at the time of the incident, Khan had even tried to show the purchase receipts to the vigilantes who did not care about it.Also Read : ‘Betrayal Of Trust’: Pehlu Khan’s Kin On Acquittal of All AccusedThe charge sheet of the case was filed in the court of ADJ-Behror on 25 February, 2018. The case was later shifted to the Alwar court.A lawyer representing the accused said the witnesses produced by the prosecution failed to identify them. He also claimed that the video that purportedly showed the lynching was not sent to a forensic lab by the prosecution.The court of Additional District Judge Sarita Swami completed the trial proceedings on August 7 and reserved judgment for Wednesday.Apart from the six men acquitted on Wednesday and the three minors, the police initially investigated the role of six others in Pehlu Khan's lynching.Those six men were given a clean chit by the police in September 2017.Also Read : Rajasthan Cops to Re-investigate Case Against Pehlu Khan’s SonsPehlu Khan's son Irshad Khan told PTI, ""I am not happy with court decision and will appeal in the higher court.""In April 2017, along with the FIR against the people who allegedly lynched Pehlu Khan, the police had also registered a case related to cattle smuggling against his two sons and a truck operator.The Gehlot government faced criticism recently after a charge sheet was filed in that case.The police then approached the court, saying it wanted to reinvestigate the cattle smuggling charge, a plea that the court accepted.Recently, the Rajasthan Assembly had passed a Bill – introduced by the current Congress government in the state – to tackle mob lynching.Defence lawyer Hukum Chand Sharma called the Alwar court decision historic and a slap on the face of the people who he said were doing politics over it.He said Pehlu Khan was a heart patient, and there were differing opinions on the cause of death– a heart attack or a rib fracture.The then BJP government in Rajasthan under Vasundhara Raje had come under flak over the killing, with the incident escalating the debate over Muslims facing attacks from cow vigilantes.Leader of Opposition in Rajasthan Assembly Gulab Chand Kataria said the previous BJP government had taken whatever action it could when the Pehlu Khan case took place.But some people projected the incident in a manner that suggested that the BJP government was in favour of the killing, Kataria, who was the state's home minister then, said.He said the BJP had acted correctly. But the matter was given a colour and raised in the entire country.""Slamming the ""Shoddy prosecution"" in the case, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted, ""In most lynchings, the accused were happy being filmed while they lynched a human being. They wanted to be famous for these awful acts, But are we to now believe that no one killed Pehlu Khan?

The company indicated plans to raise $1 billion in what is likely a placeholder amount.Backed by billions from SoftBank  and its mammoth Vision Fund, the highly anticipated float is expected as soon as next month.The New York-based company, valued at $47 billion earlier this year, has long been rumored to be plotting a massive IPO despite towering losses. The business recently disclosed 2018 net losses of $1.9 billion on revenue of $1.8 billion. To convince Wall Street it’s a business worthy of their investment will be a challenge, to say the least.In its S-1 filing, WeWork disclosed revenue north of $1.5 billion in the six months ending June 30 on losses of $904.6 million.WeWork has raised a total of $8.4 billion in a combination of debt and equity funding since it was founded in 2011. According to earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal, it’s also pursuing an asset-backed loan worth upwards of $6 billion in what could be an effort to downsize its stock offering.Its IPO is poised to become the second-largest offering of the year behind only Uber, which was valued at $82.4 billion following its May IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.WeWork plans to sell shares of its stock under the ticker symbol “We” with the share price yet to be determined. The stock exchange was not listed.SoftBank, unsurprisingly, JP Morgan and Benchmark are to be the big winners of the upcoming exit. The investment funds own roughly 114 million and 33 million pre-IPO shares, respectively. Benchmark, a venture capital fund, led a $17 million financing in the business in 2012.Seven years later, WeWork operates 528 co-working spaces in 111 cities across 29 countries, with a total of 527,000 memberships, 50% of which are based outside the U.S.Even with fast growth and a global presence, WeWork has come to represent Silicon Valley’s tendency to inflate valuations. WeWork, a real estate business with tech-enabled services built on top, burns through cash rapidly and has had a tough time plotting out a clear path to profitability.“We have grown significantly since our inception,” the company writes in the S-1. “Our membership base has grown by over 100% every year since 2014. It took us more than seven years to achieve $1 billion of run-rate revenue, but only one additional year to reach $2 billion of run-rate revenue and just six months to reach $3 billion of run-rate revenue.”As it gears up to transition into the public markets, WeWork, planning to open co-working spaces in an additional 169 locations, says it currently has 149 million potential members with a potential addressable market of $945 billion based on 2019 membership revenue figures. Ultimately, WeWork says it hopes to reach 255 million people across 280 target cities — a market opportunity worth an eye-popping $1.6 trillion, or more than that of Apple and Microsoft.WeWork is also backed by T.

Owaisi said the government threw the Constitution of India to wind by revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir with its sheer majority in Parliament.,The News Minute,"AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi has alleged that the Modi government is trying to change the demography of Kashmir through delimitation of Assembly constituencies in Jammu to install a BJP leader as the Chief Minister.He said by scrapping special status to Jammu and Kashmir with its sheer majority in Parliament, the government threw the Constitution of India to wind.Alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi lacked political wisdom of Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel, he said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was trying to implement the agenda of Jan Sangh.The Hyderabad MP was addressing Eid get-together organized at All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) headquarters in the city on Tuesday night.Stating that the Modi government violated the Constitution by scrapping Article 370 and 35A and by bifurcating Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, Owaisi said with this reckless move the government had put pro-India Kashmiris into the lap of separatists.Owaisi termed scrapping of special status as third historic blunder. ""The first blunder was the arrest of Sheikh Abdullah in 1953 and the second was the rigging in 1987 elections.""The MP said he knew Kashmiris who are intelligent and don't react immediately. He pointed out that they vent their anger two years after the riggings in 1987 polls. He said for six-eight months those in power will continue to beat the drums and make tall claims. He, however, said he prayed for peace in the entire country.Recalling his interaction with Kashmiris, the Hyderabad MP said all they want is empowerment and they have been fighting for this since 1930s.Owaisi alleged that the Centre has turned part of Jammu and Kashmir into a jail, he said people were not being allowed to come out of their houses while phone and Internet services have been suspended.Owaisi said pro-government journalists and channels trying to project the situation in Kashmir as normal but the BBC and other media houses had exposed the government.""If government says situation is normal. Let the people come out and celebrate,"" he said.""It is a mockery of democracy. The government has installed 300 telephone booths and asking people to come to these booths to make calls to their relatives,"" he added.Stating that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India, he said it was due to political wisdom of Nehru and other leaders that the state was accorded special status. He said by doing away with the special status and by implementing Jan Sangh agenda in Kashmir, Modi was doing what China did in Tibet.He predicted that the Modi government will also do away with the special provisions in states like Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagarland and Assam.Owaisi alleged that the Modi government was trying to divert attention from real issues. Referring to the crisis in automobile industry and 10 lakh job cut feared in the sector, he said the economy was on the brink of disaster but the government trying to paint a rosy picture and focus on non-issues.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/modi-trying-change-kashmirs-demography-help-bjp-owaisi-107200?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5488,Hacker converts iPhone charging cable into hacking tool,"A hacker who goes by the online handle 'MG' rigged an iPhone charging cable with a small Wi-Fi-enabled implant to convert it into a hacking tool. From a nearby device and within Wi-Fi range (or attached to a nearby Wi-Fi network), an attacker can wirelessly transmit malicious payloads on the computer using the cable.",TechCrunch,"Most people don’t think twice about picking up a phone charging cable and plugging it in. But one hacker’s project wants to change that and raise awareness of the dangers of potentially malicious charging cables.A hacker who goes by the online handle MG took an innocent-looking Apple USB Lightning cable and rigged it with a small Wi-Fi-enabled implant, which, when plugged into a computer, lets a nearby hacker run commands as if they were sitting in front of the screen.Dubbed the O.MG cable, it looks and works almost indistinguishably from an iPhone charging cable. But all an attacker has to do is swap out the legitimate cable for the malicious cable and wait until a target plugs it into their computer. From a nearby device and within Wi-Fi range (or attached to a nearby Wi-Fi network), an attacker can wirelessly transmit malicious payloads on the computer, either from pre-set commands or an attacker’s own code.Once plugged in, an attacker can remotely control the affected computer to send realistic-looking phishing pages to a victim’s screen, or remotely lock a computer screen to collect the user’s password when they log back in.MG focused his first attempt on an Apple  Lightning cable, but the implant can be used in almost any cable and against most target computers.“This specific Lightning cable allows for cross-platform attack payloads, and the implant I have created is easily adapted to other USB cable types,” MG said. “Apple just happens to be the most difficult to implant, so it was a good proof of capabilities.”In his day job as a red teamer at Verizon Media (which owns TechCrunch), he develops innovative hacking methods and techniques to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious attackers find them. Although a personal project, MG said his malicious cable can help red teamers think about defending against different kinds of threats.“Suddenly we now have victim-deployed hardware that may not be noticed for much longer periods of time,” he explained. “This changes how you think about defense tactics. We have seen that the NSA has had similar capabilities for over a decade, but it isn’t really in most people’s threat models because it isn’t seen as common enough.”“Most people know not to plug in random flash drives these days, but they aren’t expecting a cable to be a threat,” he said. “So this helps drive home education that goes deeper.”MG spent thousands of dollars of his own money and countless hours working on his project. Each cable took him about four hours to assemble. He also worked with several other hackers to write some of the code and develop exploits, and gave away his supply of hand-built cables to Def Con attendees with a plan to sell them online in the near future, he said.But the O.MG cable isn’t done yet. MG said he’s working with others to improve the cable’s functionality and expand its feature set.“It really just comes down to time and resources at this point. I have a huge list in my head that needs to become reality,” he said.(via Motherboard)",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/iphone-charging-cable-hack-computer-def-con/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
5489,FB paid people to transcribe users' vulgar audio chats: Bloomberg,"A Bloomberg report has claimed that Facebook has been paying hundreds of outside contractors to transcribe audio clips and recordings collected from its users, which also included vulgar content. The report added that the contract workers were not told where the audio was recorded or how it was obtained. According to Bloomberg, the audio came from its Messenger app.",TechCrunch,"“The future is private.” Clearly, Facebook  still has a way to go.Facebook has become the latest tech giant to face scrutiny over its handling of users’ data, following a report that said the social media giant collected audio data and recordings from its users and transcribed it using third-party contractors.The report came from Bloomberg, citing the contractors who requested anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.According to the report, the audio came from its Messenger app. The audio conversations were matched against transcriptions to see if they were properly interpreted by the company’s artificial intelligence.There are several ways that Facebook collects voice and audio data. But the social media giant’s privacy policy makes no clear mention or explanation what it uses audio data for. Bloomberg also noted that contractors felt their work was “unethical” because Facebook “hasn’t disclosed to users that third parties may review their audio.”The company has long rebuffed claims that Facebook is “not listening” to its users through your phone.We’ve asked Facebook several questions — including for what reason the audio was transcribed and why users weren’t explicitly told of the third-party transcription — but did not immediately hear back.Facebook stopped transcribing voice data earlier in August, said spokesperson Joe Osborne.The social media giant becomes the latest tech company to face questions about its use of third-party contractors and staff to review user audio.Amazon saw the initial round of flak for allowing contractors to manually review Alexa recordings without express user permission, forcing the company to add an opt-out to its Echo devices. Google also faced heat for allowing human review of audio data, along with Apple, which used contractors to listen to seemingly private Siri recordings. Microsoft also listened to some Skype calls made through the company’s app translation feature.It’s been over a year since Facebook last had a chief security officer in the wake of Alex Stamos’ departure.Read more:",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/facebook-contractors-said-to-have-collected-and-transcribed-users-audio-without-permission/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5492,India planning more dangerous action than Balakot in PoK: Pak PM,"Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Wednesday said that India is ""planning to take action"" in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in a much more ""dangerous"" way than the airstrikes it had carried out in Balakot after the terror attack in Pulwama. ""We have decided we will not tolerate any violation and are fully ready to counter it,"" he added.",Times Now,"Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan vowed Wednesday the time had come to teach Delhi a lesson and promised to ""fight until the end"" against any Indian aggression in the disputed region of Kashmir.The warning represented a dramatic escalation in rhetoric after Islamabad said last week that they had ruled out a ""military option"" over the Kashmir dispute.The remarks come as tensions skyrocketed between the nuclear-armed rivals following India's surprising move to revoke the autonomy of its portion of the disputed Himalayan territory last week.""The Pakistani army has solid information that they (India) are planning to do something in Pakistani Kashmir, and they are ready and will give a solid response,"" Khan said during a televised speech in Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.""We have decided that if India commits any type of violation we will fight until the end,"" Khan added in the speech marking the country's Independence Day.""The time has arrived to teach you a lesson.""The head of the Pakistani military also added that the country's security forces were ""fully ready to perform its part in line with our national duty for Kashmir cause"", according to a tweet from the army's spokesperson.Khan and the military's comments followed other fiery speeches in the territory's parliament, with the prime minister of Pakistani Kashmir at one point begging for permission to cross the de-facto border dividing the territory and then later bragging about opening fire on Indian troops in the past.The heated rhetoric follows days of rising hostilities from Islamabad.Following Delhi's move to abolish Indian-administered Kashmir's special status, Pakistan launched a diplomatic offensive aimed at reversing the order and formally asked the United Nations Security Council late Tuesday to hold an emergency session to address India's ""illegal actions"".Pakistan has also expelled the Indian ambassador, halted bilateral trade and suspended cross-border transport services.However, analysts said the actions were unlikely to move Delhi.Lockdown The Indian part of the picturesque Himalayan state has been under lockdown for over a week with tens of thousands of troop reinforcements deployed to the main city of Srinagar and other towns and villages.A curfew has also been enforced across the region and phone and internet lines cut to quell potential unrest.Indian authorities vowed to reduce the restrictions on freedom of movement in their portion of Kashmir following the country's own Independence Day celebrations on Thursday.Earlier this week Khan lambasted the international community for failing to challenge India and said turning a blind eye to the spread of Indian Hindu nationalism was the same as appeasing Hitler -- a comparison he again made on Wednesday.As tensions simmered with India, Pakistan moved ahead with independence celebrations which began at the stroke of midnight with firework shows lighting up the skies in major cities, where residents jammed the streets waving the national flag from their cars and motorcycles.In August 1947 the British Raj was dismantled with the subcontinent divided into two independent states -- Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.Millions were uprooted in one of the largest mass migrations in history, with experts estimating at least one million died in the communal violence unleashed by a partition that continues to haunt the subcontinent to this day.Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan ever since and has been the spark for two major wars and countless clashes between the two nuclear-armed arch-rivals.Earlier this year they came close to all-out conflict yet again, after a militant attack in Indian-held Kashmir in February was claimed by a group based in Pakistan, igniting tit-for-tat air strikes.   ",https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/we-are-prepared-to-respond-to-any-indian-aggression-on-pok-pakistan/469079?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

A spokesman declined to provide further detail on the matter to the news outlet.Jeffrey Epstein's death was reported on a notorious internet message board 40 minutes before it was officially announced and FDNY examined who the source could be The post on 4Chan was on the internet around 38 minutes before the first Tweet announcing Epstein's death on Saturday was posted by an ABC News reporter '[D]on't ask me how I know, but Epstein died an hour ago from hanging, cardiac arrest.

The committee's report was submitted by Chairman Injeti Srinivas to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. It also recommended that non-compliance be treated as a civil offence that attracts penalties and allow firms to carry forward the unspent balance for a period of 3-5 years.,The Financial Express,"A high level committee has proposed to make CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) expenditure tax-deductible and allow companies to carry forward the unspent balance for a period of 3-5 years. The sweeping recommendations may come as a major relief to companies worried about meeting stringent CSR norms or facing penalties, announced recently by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The committee recommendations aim to adopt sustainable development goals which would additionally include sports promotion, senior citizens’ welfare, the welfare of differently-abled persons, disaster management and heritage protection, said a statement by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Balancing the local area preferences with national priorities, introducing impact assessment studies for CSR obligation of 5 crore or more, and registration of implementation agencies on MCA portal were also the highlights of the recommendations.Further, there were several other recommendations such as developing a CSR exchange portal to connect contributors, beneficiaries and agencies, promoting social impact companies, and third-party assessment of major CSR projects. The committee has strongly objected to treating CSR as a means of resource gap funding for government schemes. Also, the committee discouraged passive contribution of CSR into different funds included in Schedule 7 of the Act.The committee has underlined that the CSR spending should be a board-driven process to provide innovative technology-based solutions for social problems. It has also recommended that companies having CSR prescribed amount below Rs. 50 lakh may be exempted from constituting a CSR Committee. Recommendations also state that the violation of CSR compliance may be made a civil offense and shifted to the penalty regime.Previously, there was unrest among corporates after the government brought in a provision of jail up to three years for not complying to the revised CSR norms. However, a few days later Nirmala Sitharaman said that there will be no penalty for failing to meet the revised CSR norms. Amid a slowdown in the demand and production, the government has met representatives from different sectors of the economy in the last few days. Nirmala Sitharaman has also assured the industrialists to provide all the possible support to them.
