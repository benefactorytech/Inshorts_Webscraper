There are no speed-breakers and there are trees which block the view too, they said.“Just about two months ago, there was an accident between a Bolero and a bike. Two boys on the bike died on the spot. They were from my village,” Harilal Anand, a farmer, from Pure Mahipat village said. However everyone agrees they’ve never seen an accident this bad.There are a few shops, and two dhabas, about 100 metres from the site of collision. Since it was raining, there were about 50 people in total, taking shelter from the rain.The car had caught fire. “None of us went ahead then,” Harilal said adding that a few people started dialling 100 (police) right away.Arjun said, once the fire subsided, the locals went to check on the car. The woman sitting in the front had fallen out of the window shield on the road. She was between the truck and the burning car and was crying aloud in pain. She had hurt her right hand, he said. “The two women at the back were pulled out easily as the doors were not jammed. But we took the longest to get the lawyer out. We were getting scared, someone got a metal rod, someone was trying to break the glass completely, someone was pulling hard on the handle.”Also Read : ‘We Left Survivor & Kin to Fight Alone’: How Fear Gripped UnnaoIt took fifteen minutes to get him out. “We are being told he is still battling for his life in hospital now. That is good. We didn’t think he would survive,” Arjun said.The four of them were picked up and put on benches at the biggest dhaba.“We did not give any of them water. We were scared that if they die because they can’t drink it, we will be held responsible,” 24-year-old driver Pushpen Yadav said.There must have been around 50 locals in the area by then but the driver of the truck was nowhere to be seen. “In the time that we were waiting for the fire to extinguish, they must have run away from the other side onto the fields,” Yadav says.Also Read : Born Into Politics: How Sacked BJP MLA Sengar Held Onto UnnaoWhen the police car arrived (in response to the locals’ call) the locals knew this was not just any accident. “We got to know by then that this was the Sengar case.

6925,Hundreds detained during protest in Moscow: Reports,"Russian police reportedly detained hundreds of protestors during an unauthorised opposition rally in Moscow on Saturday. According to the reports, the protestors gathered in the Russian capital after authorities disqualified many opposition candidates from contesting the Moscow parliamentary elections scheduled for September. Mobile internet was blocked in many parts of Moscow, reports claimed.",Reuters,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian police forcibly detained over 800 people attending a protest in Moscow on Saturday to demand free elections, including prominent activist Lyubov Sobol, after authorities warned the demonstration was illegal. Police removed Sobol, an ally of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny, from a taxi and bundled her into a van minutes before the start of what anti-Kremlin activists described as a peaceful walk to protest against the exclusion of their candidates from an election next month. In another blow to Navalny, Russian investigators opened a criminal investigation into the alleged laundering of 1 billion rubles ($15.3 million) by his anti-corruption foundation. Navalny and his allies say the foundation, which has published a slew of embarrassing investigations into government officials, is transparently financed from public donations.  OVD-Info, an independent monitoring group, said police had detained 828 people in Moscow on Saturday, in some cases beating them with truncheons as they lay on the floor. Reuters reporters witnessed dozens of arrests. In one case police carried off a man as he clung upside down to his bicycle.   Police said they had detained 600 and that 1,500 had attended the protest, though footage of demonstrations which flared in different parts of Moscow suggested many more had taken part. Opposition activists later posted screen shots online of police reports suggesting around 10,000 had attended.      Saturday’s protest was smaller than one a week earlier, but underlined the determination of some Kremlin critics — especially younger people — to keep pressing to open up Russia’s tightly-choreographed political system. Many but not all of those detained were later released by police, including Sobol who was fined 300,000 rubles ($4,596) for violating Russia’s tough protest laws. The focus of protesters’ anger is a prohibition on a number of opposition-minded candidates, some of whom are allies of Navalny, from taking part in a September election for Moscow’s city legislature. That vote, though local, is seen as a dry run for a national parliamentary election in 2021. Authorities say opposition candidates failed to collect enough genuine signatures to register. The excluded candidates say that is a lie and insist on taking part in a contest they believe they could win. “They (the authorities) are wiping their feet on us,” said Elena, a student attending Saturday’s protest.  Another attendee, Yevgeny Snetkov, a 61-year-old engineer, described as brazen the way the authorities had prevented opposition candidates from running. “I had no option left but to protest,” he said. Some protesters chanted “Putin is a thief” as they marched. Observers said the police presence was one of the biggest at such a protest in nearly a decade. Mobile internet access was cut in some areas and police cordoned off swathes of central Moscow to stop people gathering.     At a similar protest a week earlier, police detained more than 1,300 in one of the biggest security operations of recent years that brought wide international condemnation.  Authorities carried out a new round of detentions and home searches before Saturday’s protest and opened criminal proceedings for what they term mass civil unrest, an offence which carries a penalty of up to 15 years in jail. Activists say the Russian constitution allows them to freely protest. But authorities say they need to agree the timing and location of any demonstrations in advance, something that was not done ahead of Saturday’s protest. Opposition activists say the authorities have repeatedly refused to allow protests in central Moscow, leaving them with no choice but to go ahead anyway. At least eight of Sobol’s allies, including Navalny, are in jail for breaking protest laws. The ruling United Russia party dominates the national parliament and Navalny plus his allies are starved of media air-time. President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin have not commented on the standoff with the opposition, but Moscow prosecutors on Friday had warned would-be protesters that Saturday’s demonstration had not been approved. At well over 60 percent, Putin’s approval rating is still high compared with many other world leaders, but is lower than it used to be due to discontent over years of falling incomes.  Last year the 66-year-old former KGB intelligence officer won a landslide re-election and a new six-year term until 2024.

""Every time we woke up it was the worst feeling in the morning. Then through the day you do things and sort of get on with your life. We are professionals,"" he added.",Cricket Country,"India are closing in on a month since their heart-breaking loss to New Zealand in the semi-final of the World Cup, but judging by Virat Kohli‘s words on how the team felt after exiting the tournament, the scars of defeat may have taken more than a while to heal.ALSO READ – India vs West Indies 1st T20: Mission T20 World Cup begins In FloridaIndia, the league stage toppers in the World Cup with 15 points, chasing 240, in the first semi-final at Old Trafford in Manchester, endured a top-order collapse, which saw them getting reduced to 5 for 3. And even though Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni’s fighting 136-run stand got them close, New Zealand, secured an 18-run win, signalling the end of Kohli and India’s World Cup campaign in England.ALSO READ: West Indies series big opportunity for Pant, says KohliAs tough as the pill of defeat was to swallow for the fans, Kohli revealed it was equally tough for the team and players knowing their four-year-long dream was shattered being so close to realising it. It was the first time Kohli touched upon India’s World Cup elimination since the post-match press conference in Manchester on July 10.“The first few days after we exited the World Cup were quite difficult,” Kohli said. “Till the time the tournament got over, every time we woke up it was the worst feeling in the morning. Then through the day you do things and sort of get on with your life. We are professionals. We move ahead. Every team has to move on.ALSO READ: Questions for Kohli’s India team before first T20I“So we are quite okay with what happened in the World Cup. Yesterday the fielding session and the little bit of time we spent on the field was really good. Everyone was excited, looking forward to just playing, just being on the field again. I think that’s the best thing you can do as a team, just get on the park as soon as possible.”As India gear up for life post the World Cup, the next target remains the T20 World Cup in Australia next year. The first stop are T20Is against West Indies in Florida, the first of which takes place on Saturday. The tournament will in particular hold significance for youngsters like Navdeep Saini, Deepak and Rahul Chahar and also Rishabh Pant.“They play in front of 40 to 50,000 people regularly. They score against top players and also get them out. It will not be too intimidating for them and we have a lot of belief in their abilities. They have come here for the T20 experience,” Kohli said.“We have 25 to 26 games before the T20 World Cup. You need to see what combination you can make through these games depending on the conditions. It is a normal process at this level. There is not a single match that you can take lightly. If you need confidence, you need results as well. It boils down to the players eventually. We will try to pick our best XV through these games,” Kohli said.The World Cup saw Kohli go without a century although the India captain did register five consecutive half-centuries. Last month, Kohli had stated that with Rohit Sharma going great guns at the top, he was happy playing a different role, one where he held the innings together Here too, Kohli abided by the same belief, admitting he was open to batting according to the situation.“If the situation demands me to be aggressive, I will be. If it demands to play a certain role so that other players around me can unleash their potential, I will be more than happy to do that. In international cricket, you can’t be one-dimensional. You need to be flexible and have a lot of acceptance in terms of how the situation pans out. That has always been my mindset. If you are too rigid in your approach, you won’t be able to adjust,” he said.The lack of big names like MS Dhoni, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah has resulted in dipping of ticket sales in the US for the series, but Kohli feels with proper exposure, led by ICC’s guidance, growth of cricket in the States can only march onward and upward.“For now I think it’s all about creating that buzz and just getting people in to watch the games,” Kohli said. “The more we come here and play, obviously the game is going to get more and more buzz around it, people are going to talk about it. You see 15,000-20,000 people going to a place to watch something, obviously it should be important. Hopefully in years to come, people will have more interest. Local people in America as well, not just the Asian community or the West Indian community but the whole community in general will have more interest in the sport.“I think T20 cricket is something that can be understood and accepted in the American culture because of the length of the game and it’s quite entertaining as well. So I think for the sport to become global in many ways, a lot of interest here will go a long way in achieving that for the sport. Hopefully in years to come, we’ll have more tournaments and more series here where people just come in and start understanding the sport and just having fun like they do in any other sporting event here.”",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/india-vs-west-indies-2019-every-time-we-woke-up-it-was-the-worst-feeling-in-the-world-virat-kohli-on-indias-world-cup-exit-875265?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

While Bancroft was drafted into the Test squad and was his first international game since the ban was lifted, Smith and Warner played the World Cup where Australia were eliminated in the semi-final.However, both Smith and Warner haven’t had an easy time in England. They were taunted quite a few times during the World Cup from the crowd. It’s got worse in the Ashes as Bancroft has joined the team. The crowd at Edgbaston have been pretty open and have brought out sandpapers mocking the trio. In fact, the Edgbaston crowd is supposedly one of the most difficult crowds to play in front of as an opposition.AdvertisementThere were boos all around the ground on multiple occasions during the World Cup for Smith and Warner. Those boos have got louder in this Ashes. In the first innings, when all three of them walked out to bat, they were welcomed with a round of boos. They were led off the field with the same treatment as well.While Warner and Bancroft failed on return as they scored 2 and 8 respectively, Smith had a wonderful comeback. He fought hard and bailed Australia out of trouble. His magnificent knock of 144 helped Australia go from 122/8 to 284.It was a typical Smith knock and it never seemed like he was away from Test cricket for over 16 months. However, when Smith got to his ton, he was greeted with another round of boos. When Australia were bowling, the crowd tried to taunt the trio again. When David Warner was fielding at the boundary, the fans in those stands tried to sledge the Aussie opener.There were claims that Warner carried sandpaper. However, Warner was cheeky in his gesture. He opened his pockets and showed that there was nothing. Moreover, he was all smiles and took it in a really good way.

""Their middle stumps are gone...,"" wrote Gambhir. Bedi and Chauhan had objected to Saini's selection in Delhi's Ranji team, terming him an 'outsider'.",CricTracker,"Navdeep Saini broke into the Indian squad for the three-match T20I series against the Windies. The Delhi speedster also managed to break into the playing eleven in the first encounter at Lauderhill, Florida. The pacer didn’t show any signs of nervousness and picked up the wickets of Nicholas Pooran and Shimron Hetmyer in his very first over. Saini looked in a different zone altogether.After his masterful over, Gautam Gambhir, the former Indian cricketer, took a scathing attack on Delhi & District Cricket Association’s (DDCA) Chetan Chauhan and Bishen Singh Bedi. Gambhir has always tried to back Saini in the Delhi domestic team. When he got into the squad for the Caribbean series, Gambhir took a massive dig at Bedi and Chauhan and ridiculed them in a severe manner.AdvertisementHe has had quite a few altercations with Bedi and Chauhan. Bedi, who has criticised Gambhir time and again, questioned how an outsider could get into the Delhi team. The 37-year-old Gambhir didn’t miss out on the chance of lashing out at Bedi after Saini’s national selection.“My condolences’ to few DDCA members, @BishanBedi @ChetanChauhanCr on selection of outsider’ Navdeep Saini to India squad. Am told black armbands are available in Bangalore too for INR 225 per roll!!! Sir, just remember Navdeep is an Indian first then comes his domicile @BCCI,” Gambhir’s scathing tweet back in June read.Saini has always thanked Gambhir for staying by his side in the situation of crisis. Saini’s first national call-up came last year in June for the one-off Test match against Afghanistan, but he didn’t get a chance to play. This year, he played for the RCB and did exceptionally. He bowled with such venom that he came into contention for a spot in the national team for the 2019 World Cup.Gambhir is over the moon after Saini’s show and he also took it as a chance of bash the DDCA. He took to Twitter and wrote “Kudos Navdeep Saini on ur India debut. U already have 2 wkts even before u have bowled @BishanBedi & @ChetanChauhanCr.
