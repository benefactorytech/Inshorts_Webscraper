The district administration has made public the final report on the issue after holding public consultation with the residents of Chennai's Poes Garden in January this year.",The News Minute,"The Chennai District Collector has given her go-ahead to acquire Veda Nilayam, the residence of former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu J Jayalalithaa and convert it into a memorial.The district administration has made public the final report on the issue after holding public consultation with the residents of Chennai�s Poes Garden in January this year. �Since former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Selvi J Jayalalithaa was a phenomenal woman leader in a male-dominated society and a role model for women across the country, the decision taken by the state government to convert her residence into a government memorial is the most appropriate one,� reads the report.The Chennai Collector told TNM, ""The decision is based on the public consultation process. Once the land acquisition process is complete, work on the memorial will begin.Result of public consultationThe district administration had held public consultation in January with the current residents of Poes Garden where Veda Nilayam is situated, to find out the concerns of the residents on the government�s decision.�47 persons participated in this discussion. Their submissions � oral and written � were recorded. All of them were given the opportunity to express their views in total freedom,� the report states.Traffic snarls, road blocks, sanitation and safety were cited as the major concerns by the Poes Garden residents during this public consultation.Read:�'It's a safety issue,' Poes Garden residents oppose Jaya home memorialThe district administration has addressed these concerns in their recent report. Regulating the number of visitors who come to Veda Nilayam and amping up security by deploying more police personnel have been offered as possible solutions for the reservations expressed by the residents.While a few residents expressed concerns about the land allegedly encroached by the Stella Maris College, the district administration responded by stating that the encroached land has been transferred to the college itself and that it is not illegal occupation anymore. It also added that since Stella Maris College is an institution established under Article 30 (Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions) of the Indian Constitution, the state government cannot interfere with those rights.When asked about the objections from residents of Poes Garden against the project, the Collector says, ""There have been no objection to the project, to my knowledge.""Possibility of shifting to alternate locationOne other suggestion that had reportedly come up during the public consultation was to set up the memorial in an alternate location. This has been dismissed by the district administration, which said that the move will hurt the sentiments of the people.�Since Jayalalithaa lived in Veda Nilayam for over 30 years till her final days, this would be the appropriate place for memorial. Shifting the memorial elsewhere would hurt the sentiments of people� the report states.��The District Collector�s report has also concluded that the decision taken to acquire Veda Nilayam in order to be converted into a memorial has been taken on fair grounds and for the welfare of the public.Case pending in courtHowever, this green signal does not accelerate the process of setting up of the memorial since a case filed by Jayalalithaa�s niece and nephew � Deepa and Deepak � seeking the court to announce them as the former Chief Minister�s legal heirs is still pending in the court. This as there is no record of a will left behind by Jayalalithaa.In July, Justice N Kirubakaran came down heavily on the state government for wanting to establish a memorial using public funds.�When the state government is struggling for funds, why do you want to spend crores of rupees on a memorial? You cannot spend public money like this. We cannot allow this. You better reconsider your decision. Remember your leader and do some good work. That is sufficient,� he�told�the advocate for the state government.The District Collector�s report also mentions the case briefly by stating that the amount payable to acquire the property � a little over Rs 32 crores � will be deposited in the court since the case is pending before it.Also read:�What�s the need to convert Jaya�s Veda Nilayam into memorial?

Many people on Twitter are highlighting atrocities of Pakistan on Baloch youth, kids and women. Some users also claimed that the region was forcefully annexed to Pakistan against the people's wishes.",ANI,"New Delhi [India], Aug 14 (ANI): Pakistan was left red-faced after Balochistan, a province located on its southwestern borders, called for its freedom as the country observed 73rd Independence Day on Wednesday. The cash-strapped nation is observing August 14 as 'Kashmir Solidarity Day', in a protest against India's decision to abrogate Article 370 that accorded Jammu and Kashmir with special status, and passing a bill, which bifurcated the region into two Union Territories.Rattled by New Delhi's historic move, Islamabad had also condemned it as an ""illegal aggression"" and called on the international community, including the United Nations, the United States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, to interfere in the matter. However, reiterating its stand over the Kashmir issue, India has consistently refuted any third party interference calling it to be its ""internal matter"" and resolve all difference ""bilaterally"".However, despite Pakistan's outcry over the recent development in Kashmir, #BalochistanSolidarityDay and #14AugustBlackDay started trending on Twitter with more than 100,000 tweets and 54,000 tweets respectively.Balochistan, the most volatile province in the southwestern borders of Pakistan has been struggling since 1948 against Pakistani occupation. The Baloch people say that they got independence from the British on August 11, 1947.The province, rich in natural gas fields, has also accused China of plundering their economic wealth especially after the construction of modern transportation networks, numerous energy projects, and special economic zones under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.At a time when Islamabad has been urging the UN Security Council to take action over the plight of Kashmiris in the wake of changing status of Jammu and Kashmir, it is worth mentioning that the human rights violations in Balochistan have already drawn concerns of the international community and other human rights watchdogs.

5522,"CBS and Viacom, controlled by same family, to merge in $30 bn deal","US media giants CBS and Viacom, both controlled by the Redstone family, have agreed to combine in an all-stock merger to form ViacomCBS. CBS has a market value of $18 billion and Viacom about $11.7 billion. Shari Redstone, the daughter of billionaire Sumner Redstone, would become chairwoman of ViacomCBS, which will comprise brands like MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) have reached a deal to reunite media mogul Sumner Redstone�s U.S. entertainment empire, betting that a larger company will be able to compete and partner better in a media industry dominated by giants. The new company will be named ViacomCBS Inc, although CBS shareholders will own 61% and Viacom shareholders will own 39%. The merger will combine the CBS television network, CBS News, Showtime cable networks with MTV Networks, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and the Paramount movie studios. Together, they will own more than 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles. Annually, it is estimated to generate about $28 billion in revenue. It creates a company with roughly a $30 billion market value, which is still small compared with rivals including Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), at $136 billion, ABC network owner Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), at $245 billion, and NBC owner Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) at $193 billion.  The merging companies are controlled by National Amusements Inc, the holding company owned by billionaire Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari. �My father once said �content is king,� and never has that been more true than today,� Shari Redstone said in a statement. The third attempt at a merger since 2016 is a decisive win for Shari Redstone, whose father built the companies through a series of mergers and then broke them apart 13 years ago. Previous merger talks had failed because of clashes between executives over divvying up top jobs and the companies� relative valuation. The recombination comes amid an increasingly competitive media landscape dominated by Disney and Netflix, prompting Redstone to pursue a merger. Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish will be the president and CEO of the combined company. Joe Ianniello, interim CEO of CBS, will be named chairman and CEO of CBS, which will exclude the Showtime cable network and book publisher Simon & Schuster. Ianniello will report to Bakish. Bakish cannot fire Ianniello unless the ViacomCBS board approves. Bakish in an interview said that he will compete with Netflix, Disney and AT&T for subscribers and also create and sell TV shows and movies to other companies, an operation that will grow thanks to the new deal. �This is not a put-your-eggs-in-one-basket story,� Bakish said. �They all work together.� ViacomCBS can lure customers with free offerings from a service like PlutoTV, which it bought in January, then convince them to pay for a subscription service in another part of the empire like CBS All Access, Bakish said.  Viacom shareholders will receive 0.59625 CBS shares for each share they own, representing a slight premium to Viacom�s closing price on Monday. The companies said they expected about $500 million in annual cost savings. The new board of directors will consist of 13 members. Six will come from independent members from CBS, four independent members from Viacom, Bakish, and two National Amusements members. Shari Redstone will be appointed the chairman. Shares of Viacom rose 2.4% to $29.21 and shares of CBS rose 1.4% to $48.70 after the merger was announced. Centerview Partners LLC and Lazard Fr�res & Co served as financial advisers to the CBS board�s special committee. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP served as the special committee�s legal counsel. LionTree Advisors LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co served as financial advisers and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP as legal counsel to the special committee to the Viacom board. Viacom was advised by Shearman & Sterling LLP. National Amusements was advised by Evercore as its financial adviser and by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP as its legal counsel.

He said it is the people of West Bengal who donate their hard-earned money for setting up pandals and for the puja. ""The culture of giving money for the puja is not new. It is a very old tradition in Kolkata,"" he said. Meanwhile, protesting against the Centre for issuing income tax notices to several Durga Puja Committees in the city, the Trinamool Congress said that festivals should be exempt from tax. Claiming that there is something fishy about the Income Tax department's stand on Durga puja, the Congress lawmaker said: ""If anyone from the political parties attends, donates or celebrates this festival then it is wrong to attach Durga puja with any political party.""He added it is not acceptable that the environment of the puja is being destroyed.

It is only obvious that for pujas held this year, notices will only be issued next year, which is as per their scheme of tax assessment,"" Banerjee explained asking why the agency was misleading people.Banerjee said that the CBDT's press release is a sheer distortion of facts with an aim to create confusion in the minds of local people and puja committees.""This is an attack on our culture and on our Durga Puja festival. I do not know whether this is being done knowingly or unknowingly, but it is certainly in bad taste, especially when people of all religions, caste and creed participate in our Durga Puja,"" she said.She demanded the taxation be withdrawn and said that the festival should be allowed to be celebrated with its usual fervour.

5529,3 Malaysian ministers demand Naik's expulsion from Malaysia,Malaysia's cabinet on Wednesday discussed the permanent residency of Indian Islamic preacher Zakir Naik with three ministers demanding his expulsion from the country over his alleged racial remarks. Naik had allegedly said that Hindus in Malaysia enjoy more rights than Muslims in India. The ministers accused Naik of attempting to drive a wedge between Muslims and non-Muslims in Malaysia.,Reuters,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia�s cabinet discussed the permanent residency of Indian Islamic preacher Zakir Naik on Wednesday, with three ministers demanding his expulsion for allegedly making racially sensitive remarks in the multi-ethnic nation. Naik, who has lived in Malaysia for about three years and faces charges of money laundering and hate speech in India, has come under fire for his recent comments that Hindus in the Southeast Asian country had �100 times more rights� than the Muslim minority in India. Race and religion are sensitive issues in Malaysia, where Muslims make up about 60 percent of its 32 million people. The rest are mostly ethnic Chinese and Indians, most of whom are Hindus. The Malaysian ministers said Naik�s comments may have been aimed at driving a wedge between Muslims and non-Muslims in Malaysia, an allegation that Naik denied. �We have expressed our position, which is that action must be taken and that Zakir Naik should no longer be allowed to remain in Malaysia,� Gobind Singh Deo, minister of communications and multimedia, said in a statement. �The prime minister has taken note of our concerns. We leave it to him to consider the position and to decide soonest possible what will be done to deal with the problem,� he added. M. Kulasegaran, minister of human resources, and Xavier Jayakumar, the minister of water, land and natural resources, also released statements urging Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to expel Naik. Naik, who has repeatedly rejected the charges against him in India, said his detractors were quoting him out of context to malign him. �My praise of the Malaysian government for its Islamic and fair treatment of Hindu minorities is being twisted and misquoted to suit political gains and create communal rifts,� he said in a statement on Wednesday. Malaysian state news agency Bernama quoted Mahathir as saying late on Tuesday that Naik cannot be sent back to India due to fears for his safety. �If any (other) country wants to have him, they are welcome,� Mahathir said. India banned Naik�s Islamic Research Foundation in late 2016, accusing him of encouraging and aiding its followers to �promote or attempt to promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious communities and groups�.

The government and parliament will have to approve the proposal for it to take effect.",Reuters,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a decree on Tuesday offering citizenship to Russians suffering political persecution, and also to foreigners who fought on Kiev�s side in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy had announced such a move last month in response to a Russian decree expanding the number of Ukrainians who can apply for fast-track Russian passports. Separately Ukraine�s state security service declared a Russian consular officer in the western city of Lviv as persona non grata, accusing him of spying. The officer had already left the country, a statement said. Russia�s foreign ministry said Moscow had expelled a Ukrainian consular worker from St. Petersburg in response, TASS news agency reported. Relations between Kiev and Moscow plunged after Russia�s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for fighters in the eastern Donbass region in a conflict that has killed 13,000 people despite a notional ceasefire.  Zelenskiy has prioritized achieving peace in the Donbass region, but days after his election victory in April Russian President Vladimir Putin eased rules for residents of rebel-controlled parts of Donbass to receive passports. In July he extended the offer to government-held areas.    Zelenskiy�s decree would apply to citizens of the Russian Federation who had been persecuted for political reasons, a statement on the presidential website said.  They would need to provide a certificate from Ukraine�s foreign ministry or a diplomatic mission or a consular post confirming they were being persecuted in their native country for their political beliefs. It is now up to the government and parliament to legislate for the proposal to take effect.  The president�s Servant of the People party will be the largest in the new parliament following its landslide victory in a snap election in July.     Zelenskiy last week pressed Putin for a resumption of peace talks after four Ukrainian soldiers were killed by shelling in the Donbass region. Putin in turn said Ukrainian forces must stop the shelling of settlements in the Donbass that led to civilian casualties.

As the floodgates of the Kabini reservoir was opened, water inundated the Nanjangud town, 169 km southwest of Bengaluru. Many people had to take shelter in the relief camps leaving their belongings behind.While others were in tears, Murthy saw an opportunity to challenge the swollen Kapila. On Saturday morning, Murthy took a plunge into the furious river and remained missing for more than two days. The video of Murthy's daredevil act went viral on social media and many speculated that he was no more. News channels, too, counted him in the list of the flood victims. Murthy's family searched for him, but to no avail.But, defying all the reports about him, Murthy emerged on Monday, much to the amazement of people. ""Yes, he is alive. He had come to the police station in the evening,"" a Nanjangud rural police station officer told PTI.This daredevilry and his safe return did not surprise his sister Manjula, who says this was not the first time that Murthy had jumped into the river. ""He has been doing it for the past 25-30 years,"" she told PTI. Though Manjula was confident of Murthy's return, his disappearance for two days left her worried.""Never ever he took more than half-an-hour to return safe,"" she said. ""This time he was trapped at a pillar of Hejjige bridge and remained there for two days.""People standing on the Hejjige bridge saw Murthy in the river on Saturday and tried to save him by throwing the rope. But on seeing him disappearing in the strong current of Kapila, they concluded he was no more.""I usually swam from the middle of the pillars, but the current was so strong that I opted to hold the pillar. That was a mistake as I was trapped in the weeds stuck there,"" Murthy told a news channel.Somehow, he managed to climb on the chamber of the bridge and remained there for 60 hours and came out from there once the flood receded.Defying his age, the temple priest had travelled across the country -- from Kashmir to Kanyakumari -- covering a distance of 10,000 km a few years ago on his battered bicycle.The rains and flood have wreaked havoc in several districts of Karnataka, with the toll rising to 54 and nearly four lakh people lodged in relief camps.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu too had said the same thing,"" she said.The BJP has time and again accused her of appeasing the Muslim community of the state to secure the minority votes. Referring to BJP's allegations that Durga Puja is being curtailed in the state by the Trinamool Congress government, she said the saffron party should first look into the work it has done since it came to power at the Centre. ""More Durga Pujas are being held in the state under the TMC rule than during the previous regimes. Before lecturing us they (BJP) should look into the work they have done after coming to power,"" Banerjee said.""I challenge them (BJP) to compare the number of religious work that our eight-year-old government has done and that by the previous regimes. We believe in humanity and religion means humanity. It teaches us to love and respect every human being. Religion does not teach us to divide the people,"" she said. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu preached love and peace and was assaulted. ""So was social reformer Raja Rammohan Roy. But they were undeterred,"" she added.",https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/it-will-be-better-for-me-to-die-than-prove-my-religion-mamata-banerjee?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5584,"Shoaib Akhtar threw rocks at mountains, bowled with them for muscles","Ex-Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar used to throw rocks at mountains in order to build muscles when he was young. Akhtar, who picked up 444 international wickets for Pakistan in 224 matches, had revealed in an interview that he also used to bowl with rocks and other kids used to think that he was mad. Notably, Akhtar turns 44 today.",Cricket Country,"Shoaib Akhtar, born August 13, 1975, is one of the fastest bowlers to have ever played the game. A colourful character, both on and off the field, Shoaib polarised teammates and fans. He was simultaneously beloved and despised but never out of the limelight. On his 42nd birthday, Shiamak Unwalla takes a look at 14 interesting things to know about the man whose mercurial tendencies made him a pain for administrators, but whose pace made him a vital cog in Pakistan�s attack.1.  A rough beginning: Shoaib was born in Rawalpindi, Punjab, which is why he got his famous �Rawalpindi Express� nickname. But it was not always smooth sailing; he was born into a poor family that lived in, according to his autobiography Controversially Yours, a �one-room semi-pucca house.�2.  Training with rocks: The young Shoaib was inventive; in order to develop muscles to bowl fast, he would throw bricks on the mountains near his home, and bowl using rocks picked up off the ground. Shoaib revealed in an interview with The Cricket Monthly that his friends used to think he was mad for doing so, but the entire exercise gave him the necessary muscles to bowl fast. In years to come, he emerged as one of the fastest bowlers the game had ever seen.3.  Fastest-ever World Cup delivery: Shoaib and Brett Lee were perhaps the fastest bowlers of their generation, and the two used to have a fierce yet friendly rivalry over which of them would bowl faster. Shoaib won the battle when he bowled the fastest ever delivery recorded in World Cup history. Bowling the fourth over of the innings in Pakistan�s match against England in ICC Cricket World Cup 2003, Shoaib sent down what seemed like an innocuous delivery on Nick Knight�s pads. Neither bowler nor batsman seemed very fazed, but a moment later the speed was shown on the big screen: 161.3 kmph or 100.2 mph. Shoaib had broken the 100mph barrier in World Cup cricket.4.  No mug with the bat: Shoaib was far from reliable with the bat, but he was no mug either. When he was in the mood he could use those admirable biceps of his to muscle the ball well over the ropes. He proved this on a few occasions. Firstly, in that same match against England, Shoaib came in to bat at 80 for nine, faced 16 balls, and hit 43. Pakistan still lost the match, but Shoaib thrilled the crowds with five fours and three sixes. He also had a couple of Test 40s against India, one of which came when Irfan Pathan took a hat-trick in the first over of the Test at Karachi in 2006. Coming in at 154 for 7, Shoaib was the last man out for 45 as Pakistan eventually recovered to get to 245.5.  The nonconformist: Never quite the teacher�s pet, Shoaib often got into fights with his teammates and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). There were numerous bans and suspensions, the most notable of which was when he hit teammate Mohammad Asif with a bat. Apparently Shahid Afridi and Asif had been having fun at Shoaib�s expense after a bad day in the office, and Shoaib retaliated by swinging the bat, though Asif might not have been the target. Co-incidentally, Shoaib and Asif were suspended after failing a dope test some time before this incident.6.  Help from �Boss�: Shoaib was still relatively unknown when he toured India in 1999. Playing the second Test at Eden Gardens, Shoaib prayed to God to help get Sachin Tendulkar out early. Shoaib wrote in his autobiography that he prayed to �Boss� to get Tendulkar out first ball. Sure enough, the iconic yorker followed and Tendulkar walked back for a golden duck. A ball prior, he had sent back Rahul Dravid in a similar fashion.7.  Working through the pain: Like most express pace bowlers, Shoaib was never without niggles. However, his weak knees were especially painful. Shoaib revealed that he used to crawl and limp while off the field, going so far as to say, �I can�t remember a day I didn�t have pain in my knees for the last 18 years.�8.  Fast but not furious? Shoaib told The Cricket Monthly that he did not enjoy it when he hit batsmen. �I never enjoyed hitting people. I never ever enjoyed hitting people. Not for one second of my life.� He immediately proceeded to contradict himself though, saying that if he could not get the batsman out then he would �love� to hit them. Typical Shoaib!9.  Brawn and brain: As fast as Shoaib was, he was far from dull. He related an incident in which he bowled Matthew Hayden a couple of short balls and once he knew he had the batsman on the back foot, bowled him with a yorker. Shoaib said that he had two fielders whose job was to observe the batsmen�s footwork and report back to him. Shoaib was also skilful; on being unable to dismiss a rampaging Virender Sehwag in one Test, Shoaib claims to have developed a method of bowling into the stumps and slanting the ball across the batsman. He claims to have got Sehwag and also Sachin Tendulkar out in this manner.10.  The fastest bowler� According to Shoaib himself the fastest bowler he ever saw in action was Mohammad Zahid, who took 11 wickets on Test debut against New Zealand but only ever played five Tests and 11 ODIs.11.  Anti-net practice: Shoaib was ardently opposed to bowling in the nets because even if a bowler gets hit, he would not have to suffer the �humiliation� of going for a boundary. Shoaib said that if the bowler is hit for runs in a match it will hurt and he will be sufficiently motivated to bowl well. Of course, this aversion to net practice did not stop Shoaib from bowling full throttle at his own batsmen, so much so that Mohammad Yousuf once jokingly asked Shoaib not to hit him.12.  Scared to bowl: Tendulkar�s epic 98 against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup has gone down in history as one of the finest ever World Cup knocks, while his upper cut for six over point off Shoaib is frequently cited as one of the most memorable shots in recent times. Wasim Akram later revealed that Shoaib was so put off by that shot that he asked the captain Waqar Younis to take him off the attack. However, it was Shoaib who later got Tendulkar�s wicket. 13.  His biggest nightmare� Despite Shoaib�s rivalry with Tendulkar, he said that his biggest nightmare was bowling to Dravid. �The biggest nightmare I ever faced was Rahul Dravid. He used to bore me. He was the first batsman who could intimidate me�when he walked in I knew I would have to field for at least two sessions more.� [Also Read: Shoaib Akhtar calls Sachin Tendulkar a �brutal force�; compares Rahul Dravid to �Muhammad Ali�]14.  Critical of teammates: Shoaib has rarely shied away from criticising his teammates, frequently speaking out against the likes of Waqar Younis and Misbah-ul-Haq. After Pakistan�s poor showing during ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, Shoaib went on a tirade on TV against Younis Khan and Misbah, blaming them for Pakistan�s failure. He said of Misbah, �Itna buzdil kaptaan maine Pakistan ki history mein nai dekha (I have never seen such a cowardly captain in Pakistan�s history).�(Shiamak Unwalla is a proud Whovian and all-round geek who also dabbles in cricket writing as a reporter with CricketCountry.

5594,Shoaib Akhtar was the first ever bowler to bowl over 100mph,"Former Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar was the first player to bowl over 100mph, recording 100.04mph (161kmph) in an ODI against New Zealand on April 27, 2002. However, the record remained unofficial since ICC refused to sanction it as they didn't have a standard measuring tool. In 2003, Akhtar went on to bowl the fastest delivery in recorded history, clocking 161.3kmph.",Cricket Country,"The approaching storm�Shoaib Akhtar running into to bowl his thunderbolts � Getty ImagesOn April 27, 2002, Shoaib Akhtar became the first man in the history of international cricket to cross the 100-mile barrier, but the International Cricket Council refused to recognise the feat, stating it wasn�t picked off a standard measuring tool. Karthik Parimal takes a trip down memory lane to see what the decision meant to Shoaib and how he repeated the insanity an year later.�Fast bowling is about imposing yourself on the batsman,� said Waqar Younis a few months ago. The authenticity of this statement needs no verification, for its source is one who was trained to bowl at tearaway speeds during the initial stages of his career, and mastered it in due course of time. It was a trait Waqar passed to many in the Pakistani line-up, and the examples of it are well-documented. During latter stages, when he was assigned the task of leading the side, Waqar played a more sedate, yet effective, role with ball, leaving the likes of Shoaib Akhtar to �impose� themselves on the batsmen with sheer pace.A decade ago, Shoaib and Brett Lee were the only two speedsters who were touted to break the 100 mph barrier; or at least to hover around the speed with which West Indies and the English pacers of the 1970s and �80s consistently bowled at. Yet, the previous fastest delivery that was recorded, albeit not during an international or a domestic fixture, was that of Jeff Thomson�s � 99.8 mph in 1976. In his book, The Art of Fast Bowling, Dennis Lillee states that, in 1975, Thomson bowled at 160.45 kph, which amounts to 99.7 mph. However, �very accurate high speed cameras� and a close study of the best fast bowlers in the world � Lillee, Michael Holding, Wayne Daniel, Bob Willis, John Snow and Andy Roberts, to name a few � had revealed that none ever recorded a speed of 100 mph or over.The day that frontier was conqueredIn the April of 2002, in the bustling city of Lahore, New Zealand met Pakistan for the third and final One-Day International (ODI) � although it was inconsequential, for the hosts had already lapped up the first two matches � of the abridged series. Having elected to bat, Pakistan scored 278 in their 50 overs, thereby setting a formidable total for the Kiwis to chase (this was before Twenty20 had become rampant). The new-ball bowlers were Waqar and Shoaib, and while the former was meticulously working away at the openers, the latter was wayward but, without a shadow of doubt, quick. Any delivery directed at the body had the batsman hopping at the crease like a cat on a hot tin roof.He seldom took his foot off the gas pedal on that eventful day, consistently clocking a little over 99 mph. One such delivery to No.3 batsman Craig McMillan was recorded at 99.3 mph (159 kph).  Another ball, as indicated by the speed gun provided by one of the sponsors, was clocked at 100.04 mph (161 kph). This caused great joy for many associated with Pakistan cricket, since one of their own lads was the first to break into uncharted territory.Khalid Butt, the Pakistan Cricket Board�s Media Manager, released the following statement post the game that saw Pakistan win by 66 runs: �According to the speed gun operated in the ground by a sponsor, Shoaib Akhtar bowled a delivery at a speed of 161kph during the third ODI between Pakistan and New Zealand at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.�Or was it?Nevertheless, the International Cricket Council (ICC) refused to recognise this feat, for they didn�t have a standard measuring tool. Clarifying that they never kept any official records about bowling speeds, then ICC spokesman David Clarke clearly stated that �it�s not an officially recognised record.�Questions were raised with regards to the accuracy of the recorder too. The case of a malfunction wasn�t ruled out either. This prompted CyberNet, the sponsor of the speed gun for that series, to release a media statement that read as follows: �The Speed Radar Gun was used in all the three One-Day Internationals played in Pakistan. The accuracy of the Speed Radar Gun is authentic and reliable as it can be tested with an internationally used speed checking device. We have no interests of claiming any �World Records� or any �Official records� and are acting in the best interest of the game of cricket. On the third One-Day International at Lahore our Speed Radar Gun showed Shoaib Akhtar�s delivery at 161kph in his second over.�One year later, it�s officialDespite the hullabaloo that followed, the verdict from the head honchos wasn�t ruled in Shoaib�s favour. Nonetheless, one year later, during the 2003 World Cup, on February 22 against England at Cape Town, he bowled at 161.3 kph (100.23 mph) and, ostensibly, signalled to the powers that be that he had now done it twice. �The media has highlighted my �exploits� both on and off the field, ensuring that my personal life was well documented, even if not always accurately. But I was the first to cross the 100-mile barrier, twice, and am still the fastest bowler in the world, having set an official world record by achieving the fastest delivery ever, clocking in at 161.3 kmph (100.2 mph),� recalls Shoaib in his autobiography Controversially Yours.A few bowlers � notably Shaun Tait, Brett Lee and Mohammad Sami � have clocked speeds over 160 kph, but, like was Akhtar�s first case, they hadn�t been picked off a standard measuring tool.(Karthik Parimal, a Correspondent with CricketCountry, is a cricket aficionado and a worshipper of the game.

The 32-year-old added he might play doubles and mixed doubles at US Open.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Andy Murray announced on Monday he would not play singles at the U.S. Open after losing in his long-awaited return from hip surgery at the Cincinnati Masters. The Scot lost 6-4 6-4 to Richard Gasquet in his first singles match since January before saying he had turned down a wild card into the men�s draw at the year�s final Grand Slam. �I am not going to play U.S. Open singles,� the 32-year-old said.   �I didn�t feel I was able to make that decision before today�s match.� He indicated, though, that he would play doubles and mixed doubles at Flushing Meadows in two weeks and left open the door for possibly for playing before then. �I may play Winston-Salem potentially,� he said of the North Carolina event, which starts in six days. �But I�ll probably look at just playing doubles and mixed doubles. That�s what I will do at the U.S. Open.� In his first match since the hip resurfacing surgery which he hopes will prolong his career, Murray started tentatively but improved as the went on, even if he was always up against it after Gasquet broke his serve to start both sets. �I don�t really know what I was expecting, to be honest. I think I did okay,� he told a news conference. �I think there was a lot of things I would like to have done better in the match, but, you know, you also have to be somewhat realistic, as well, in terms of what you can expect.� Not having playing singles tennis for several months had an obvious impact, he said. �I think physically, you know, my legs were a little bit heavy at the end of the match in comparison to maybe what they normally would be if you played a bunch,� he said. �I was having to move quite a lot laterally, and I didn�t move forward particularly well. Like when he drop-shotted, there was a few times I didn�t even run to the ball, didn�t react to it, and that�s nothing to do with my hip.� The former world number one arrived on centre court to huge cheers, recording a video of the moment as he offered a big smile.  But the first serve was far from what Murray and the crowd � particularly the fan waving the Scotland flag � wanted.               A two time winner of the tournament, Murray double-faulted and Frenchman Gasquet, who returned himself in May from groin problems, was quickly 2-0 up. Murray then seemed to find himself. The Briton, moving better, won three consecutive games, including a break of serve, to go ahead 3-2. But Gasquet, 33, won the next three games to move ahead 5-3 and into position to take the opener. Murray played much better in the second set and had a break point to get back on serve at 2-2. But Gasquet never let go of his early break and eventually went up 4-2. A focused Nick Kyrgios later defeated Italy�s Lorenzo Sonego 7-6 6-4 in their first-round duel under the lights.  The unpredictable Australian bowed for the crowd after an impressive backhand stab volley gave him a 4-2 lead in the second set but he was otherwise business-like in the win.  Kyrgios, who won the Citi Open last week, said he was ready to build on that success after he was eliminated in the first round of the Rogers Cup on Tuesday following an argument with the chair umpire.  �I�m super happy with that week but I�m trying to build on it,� Kyrgios said of winning the title in Washington.  �It was an amazing week, awesome memories. I�m trying to create more things like that.� Next up for Kyrgios is a first career meeting with eighth seed Karen Khachanov in the second round on Wednesday.   Earlier, Marin Cilic became the first seed to fall when he was eliminated by Radu Albot of Moldova 6-4 7-6(6), while Serbia�s Miomir Kecmanovic upset Canadian Felix Auger Aliassime 6-3 6-3. American Sam Querrey and Japan�s Yodhihito Nishioka were also winners, Querrey outlasting France�s Pierre-Hughues Herbert 7-6(2) 7-6(1) and Nishioka defeated Australian Jordan Thompson  7-5 5-7 6-4. World number two Rafa Nadal, the second seed, withdrew overnight, citing fatigue after winning his fifth Rogers Cup title on Sunday.

5601,Bosch making 3D displays for cars that don't need special glasses,"German engineering and technology company Bosch is working on developing 3D displays for cars using passive 3D technology to eliminate the need for wearing special glasses. Bosch said that the 3D displays could help in pop-up alert signs, more accurate views for parking, among others. ""The display's depth of field means drivers can grasp important visual information faster,"" it said.",TechCrunch,"German auto industry giant Bosch  is developing new technology that will add glasses-free 3D imaging to future versions of its in-car digital display technology. These 3D displays use passive 3D tech, which means you won�t need to wear glasses to see the effect, and it also skips eye tracking, which is a key ingredient for most high-quality glasses-free 3D displays today.Going glasses-free and not requiring that a viewer look from a very specific position are both key ingredients for successfully bringing 3D display tech to cars � for obvious reasons. A driver needs to be focused on the road, and the fundamental guiding principle for all current in-car display tech is that they provide easy-to-grasp information at a glance, so that a driver�s focus stays exactly where it should.But why would a driver even want 3D visual effects in their instrument panel or infotainment display? Well, Bosch says there are multiple compelling reasons, including making sure that crucial alerts really pop-out when they need to in an attention-catching way. Plus, parking cameras can present even more accurate 3D views to the driver so they really get a sense of the space they�re working with. And during navigation, guidance can offer 3D representations of where and when to turn, which can eliminate questions around whether that next corner really is the right corner you�re looking for.audi tt em2 1205 zentral groesser mapiaa 2019 4bosch 3d displayThat�s all stuff that could be beneficial now, but it�s also a bet on a future where vehicles are autonomous at least part of the time, and in-car immersive displays could be even more of an opportunity to entertain and inform passengers while they�re ferried to their destinations.Bosch says that part of the reason they can do this now, compared to in the past, is that more powerful mobile computing has changed the game for what they can build. Instead of having essentially myriad tiny, cheap underpowered controllers scattered throughout a car�s tech stack, automakers are generally moving toward having one centralized computer that�s plenty more powerful, and that can be updated easily and quickly over-the-air.The company doesn�t say when we�ll see these systems actually in use through their automaker customers in shipping cars, but especially in the high-end where premium distinguishing features can make all the difference, it shouldn�t be long before some carmaker takes the plunge.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/bosch-is-working-on-glasses-free-3d-displays-for-in-car-use/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5608,Indias retail inflation falls to 3.15% in July,"India's retail inflation in July fell to 3.15% from 3.18% in June, staying below RBI's 4% medium-term target for the 12th consecutive month. RBI has projected retail inflation to be at 3.1% during July-September and 3.4%-3.7% during October-March 2019-20. Retail inflation has been dropping since November 2013's 12.17% due to fall in food and oil prices and low consumer demand.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India�s retail inflation rate eased slightly in July, staying below the central bank�s 4% medium-term target for a 12th straight month, strengthening views that there will be a policy rate cut in October. Annual retail inflation in July was 3.15%, down from an eight-month high of 3.18% in June, but below analyst forecasts, data from the Ministry of Statistics showed on Tuesday. A Reuters poll predicted an annual retail inflation rate for July of 3.20%. The Reserve Bank of India last week lowered its benchmark interest rate for a fourth meeting in a row, by an unconventional 35 basis points to 5.40%. It projected inflation to remain at 3.4% to 3.7% during the October-March 2020 period. Economists said the central bank could cut rates further, following subdued inflation amid growing concerns about economic slowdown.  �Retail inflation remains subdued, with most of the components indicating not much variation compared to the earlier periods,� said Joseph Thomas, research head at Emkay Wealth Management. Retail food prices, which make up nearly half of India�s inflation basket, increased 2.36% in July from a year earlier, compared with an upwardly revised 2.25% in June. Food prices are likely to remain subdued after a pick-up in rainfall in several parts of the country, which will boost crops.   Core consumer inflation, which strips out food and fuel prices, was estimated between 4.47% and 4.6% in July, above 4.09% to 4.11% in June, according to two analysts who estimated from inflation figures released on Tuesday. Retail inflation in India has eased sharply since a November 2013 peak of 12.17%, thanks to falls in prices of food and oil, as well as sluggish domestic consumer demand. Low inflation helped Prime Minister Narendra Modi win a second term in a landslide election victory in May.  While low inflation is helping the economy, declining farm incomes and record high unemployment have hit consumer demand and economic growth.  The inflation numbers suggested subdued demand conditions in the economy, said Garima Kapoor, an economist and vice president of Elara Capital in the financial capital of Mumbai.     �Some revival in consumption would begin to kick in as government spending gathers pace...We should begin to see gradual improvement in growth condition from January-March quarter onwards.�  The government is worried about declines in private investment and a manufacturing slowdown, particularly the auto sector, which pulled the annual economic growth pace to a five-year low of 5.8% in January-March. Separately, figures released on Friday showed industrial output increased 2% in June from a year earlier.   The RBI, which will hold its next policy review on Oct.4,  has lowered its economic growth forecast for the current financial year ending March 2020 to 6.9% with a downward bias from an earlier forecast of 7%.

5611,TN Central University students face action for discussing Article 370,The Central University of Tamil Nadu issued memos to at least 30 students for allegedly discussing Article 370 revocation. The students said they were participating in a weekly study circle to prepare for the Union Public Service Commission exam. The memo said that people indulging in activities that are a threat to national security can be dismissed without any inquiry.,The News Minute,"Two days after the Union government decided to revoke Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which gave autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, Rajesh* was headed to his weekly meeting. A student of the Tamil Nadu Central University in Thiruvarur district, Rajesh and his friends are civil service aspirants who have been taking part in a weekly study circle. The Freedom Speakers study circle helps the students keep abreast of current events even as they prepare to crack the competitive Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exam. However, shortly after they gathered, the college administration arrived at the classroom and asked them to leave. Why? Because they were discussing Article 370.�Rajesh and fellow students say that they were discussing the history of Article 370, as they would every current event, every week. Curiously, last Wednesday�s discussion alone irked the administration.�Celebrations, solidarity posters�Rajesh alleges, �As soon as the government announced the abrogation of Article 370, the faculty and students belonging to the Hindi department and the School of Social Sciences were celebrating. They belong to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP, a right-wing student outfit) group in college. They distributed sweets on campus, inside the departments and they took group photos. The administration says that we are an apolitical institution but no action was taken against the faculty or students who celebrated.��The move by the Centre to remove Jammu and Kashmir�s special status was met with protests even as Kashmiris were and continue to be under lockdown with no phone or internet connectivity. On Wednesday morning� the day the study circle convenes each week� posters expressing solidarity with the Kashmiris appeared on the walls of the college. ""To our Kashmir brothers and sisters, #WeStandWithYou"" read one poster while another said, ""Defend Article 370 of the Constitution"". ""Some nights I wonder how will I meet my death. Then, I remember I am a Kashmiri and death will come to me as a bullet,"" read one poster quoting Kashmiri writer Farah Bashir. Angered by this, the management reportedly filed a police complaint to find the culprits.��No assembling for freedom of speech��Our study circle was being held the same day so they just linked the poster incident to our study circle and blamed us for it. When they came along with the police and asked us to leave, we refused saying we are only discussing the history of the Constitution. It was not a political discussion at all. They said that all forms of discussions are banned inside the campus. They warned us of strict action but we refused to leave. We dispersed only at 8: 30 pm when the discussion usually ends. While we were there, they took down our names and videographed us. The following day, Rajesh and 30 other students receive a memo which asked them for an explanation as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against them,� alleges Rajesh.�Denying involvement, the students allege that it could be an inside job, carried out by the ABVP, in order to frame them. �They have always had a problem with our study circle,� they allege.Calling the presence of students at the study circle a �breach of conduct rules and established procedures�, the memo issued by the registrar reads, �It has already been instructed by the administration for observance of good conduct and orderly behaviour to maintain harmony in the University campus and further instructed to desist from assembling/ congregating in the name of student�s freedom of speech inside the campus since it is against the spirit of Ordinance No 42 issued under Section 6 of the Act and Statute. It had also been informed through circulars that anybody or group of persons who indulges in activities which is a threat to the security and integrity of India will not be tolerated and stern action would be taken against them including dismissal from the University without conduct of any inquiry followed by criminal action under IPC.�Media coverage�While the incident has sparked a row on campus, media coverage of the incident has seen the naming and shaming of Kashmiri students of the University who reportedly did not participate in the study circle. Puthiya Thalaimurai and News18 Tamil, two Tamil-language news channels, have published the names of five students from Jammu and Kashmir along with their departments, hostel names and room numbers, exposing them to threats.Speaking to TNM on the condition of anonymity, one of the Kashmiri students, says, �How can they publish all our details when we didn�t even participate? The administration knows us, even they are on our side and say that it is unfortunate. This is a violation of our privacy and a false accusation. The comments on these news pieces are threatening us. They are calling us jihadists and anti-national. We have given a complaint regarding this to the administration.��TNM has reached out to the University and is yet to receive a response.

The trading window is open and Mumbai Indians (MI) took the first step trading Mayank Markande for Sherfane Rutherford of the Delhi Capitals (DC). However, in a dramatic turn of events, it has been reported now that the Delhi franchise is looking to pick Rajasthan Royals� Ajinkya Rahane for the next season.Rahane led the Royals for a majority of 2019 season and stepped down with the results not going in the team�s favour. Steve Smith was reinstated as the skipper of the team and many had criticised Rahane for his tactics while at the helm. If at all, the DC manages to secure Rahane�s services for the next IPL edition, it will be another big move from the franchise after getting hold of Shikhar Dhawan last season.AdvertisementThe left-handed opener ended up amassing 521 runs even as Delhi Capitals also managed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2012.The source privy to the developments has confirmed that the Delhi franchise is trying to get Ajinkya Rahane into the team.

But yes, talks are on,� the source was quoted as saying by Outlook.Ajinkya Rahane brings experience to the team and him opening the innings along with Shikhar Dhawan next season will make it a perfect pair for the DC. �The side has attempted to get the right balance between youth and experience and what Rahane brings to the table isn�t something one needs to talk about. It is there for all to see.�Dhawan and Ishant Sharma showed what having experienced heads in the dug-out means when the situation is tough and this could be a dream move if sealed,� the source further added.

5643,"Verizon to sell Tumblr to WordPress.com owner, 2 yrs after buying it","American telecoms giant Verizon is selling microblogging and social networking platform Tumblr to WordPress.com owner Automattic for an undisclosed amount. Verizon had acquired Yahoo for $4.5 billion in 2017, which had itself bought Tumblr for over $1 billion in 2013. Notably, responding to reports of Tumblr being on sale, Pornhub had said that it was ""extremely interested"" in the acquisition.",Engadget,"The rumors of Verizon selling Tumblr turned out to have merit.  Verizon (Engadget's parent company) is selling the social network to Automattic, the company behind the blogging tool WordPress.  It's not disclosing the size of the deal, but Automattic is taking on 200 employees as part of the exchange.  Automattic chief Matt Mullenweg told the Wall Street Journal that this is his company's largest acquisition both in terms of cost and sheer staff count.And in case you're wondering: no, Automattic won't reverse the ban on adult content.  He saw Tumblr as a companion to WordPress and ""just fun.""It's a low-key end to a long, rough chapter in Tumblr's history.  Yahoo bought the site in 2013 for a hefty $1.1 billion, but never really found a way to compete with the explosive growth of social networks like Instagram.  Some features felt tacked on to seize on momentary trends.  Yahoo would eventually write off about $230 million of the site's value in 2016, and things didn't improve when Verizon bought Yahoo.  Its user base is still large with 475.1 million blogs, but it's not the force it was in its heyday.And yes, some of that decline came directly from the decision to ban porn and other racy material from the site.  It's unclear how much the fallout from 'cleaning' Tumblr affected the decision to sell the site, but it clearly didn't help.  Automattic faces the challenge of persuading users that Tumblr can uphold that decision while getting a second lease on life.Verizon owns Engadget's parent company, Verizon Media.

The new entity will also be led by Paytm Founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Last valued at over $3 billion with eBay picking up a 5.5% stake, Paytm Mall recently adopted a hyperlocal business model and is shutting down its warehouses.",Entrackr,"Amidst several rejig, changes in the company�s business model, Paytm Mall has finally decided to separate all functions from its holding company One97 Communications.According to the company, it�s going through a complete rebuilding exercise and wanted no common workforce among the other business � payment and e-commerce. The only exception is Paytm boss Vijay Shekhar Sharm, who will continue to lead both firms.The reorganising strategy may work for the Softbank-backed firm, that has been claiming to cut burn rate through shutting down warehouses and eventually pivoting to an asset-light model.Since January, the only positive thing that happened to the company was getting eBay as a backer when the early investors i.e Softbank and Alibaba refrained from taking part in the round.eBay holds about 5.59% stake in Paytm Mall for about $160 million investment. Interestingly, Paytm Mall�s valuation soared to $3 billion. The eBay backing seems to have brought back the confidence for Paytm Mall as Rudra Dalmia, chief financial officer and board member of the company reveals the aim of clocking 1.5X revenue and cutting cost by one-fifth in this year.Besides, Paytm Mall will also leverage the eBay brand to ramp up its presence across the country as well as overseas. To generate more revenue through advertisement, PoS and marketing, the Noida-based firm has integrated deal and discovery platform Nearbuy.Curiously, Paytm is pushing Nearbuy through eBay that was adding no value since its acquisition in December 2017. According to some rumours, Nearbuy was even on the verge of shut down.Paytm Mall has introduced gift cards, launched the eBay international store with merchandise, and has tied up with Future Group, Reliance Industries and BigBasket for its offline-to-online (O2O) business.In a nutshell, Payt Mall aims to bring more and more users for transactions on the platform for movie ticketing, travel, and games. On the other side, eBay will open a store on Paytm Mall, which will provide 130 million of Paytm and Paytm Mall�s customers with access to its global inventory.While Paytm Mall�s strategy to work as a separate unit from the mother entity reflects the confidence after several setbacks including shifting focus to O2O, top-notch exits, and forensic audit for a multicrore scam, the firm�s decision to cut burn rate and rebuilding may turn into a positive outcome.The development was reported by ET.",https://entrackr.com/2019/08/paytm-mall-independent-entity-one97/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5646,"Strike over beef, pork has nothing to do with religion: Zomato CEO","Zomato's CEO Deepinder Goyal has responded to the strike of delivery boys in West Bengal's Howrah against beef and pork delivery in an e-mail to the employees. ""It has nothing to do with food or religion or beliefs,"" he said. Goyal added the strike is ""conflating meaningful work and livelihood opportunities with false outrage about religion and personal food choices.""",The Quint,"Video Editor: Vishal KumarA protest by a number of Zomato delivery executives in West Bengal�s Howrah, against delivering beef and pork products, grabbed national headlines recently. The food delivery app�s riders claim that doing so �hurt their religious sentiments.�A closer inspection of the matter, however, betrays the political colouring behind the protests and reveals certain glaring discrepancies:Sanjiv Kumar Shukla, local BJP leader and party secretary for Uttar Howrah, who has been part of the protest by the Zomato delivery executives, has no qualms in admitting, �This protest is a reaction to Zomato�s tweet.�Also Read : �Won�t Deliver Beef or Pork�: Zomato Staff Goes on Strike in WBGoyal also stated, �We took a look in our order database and there were zero orders from local homes for any item containing pork in the last three months in that entire area. There was one order of a food item containing beef but the customer cancelled that order before it was executed, let alone delivered. While I wanted to give you the facts about what was ordered�or not ordered by households in that area�that is actually besides the point.� He further asked his employees at Zomato to �ignore the noise and not get distracted.�Also Read : �Misinformation & Hyperbole�: Zomato Clarifies in Letter to StaffSeated inside the house of a young BJP worker named Vishal Jaiswal, in Howrah�s Odiapara � who also owns a small space nearby that serves as a local BJP office � this reporter met 34-year-old Sanjiv Kumar Shukla.The locals describe Shukla, and a man named Bajrang Nath Verma, as the people behind the Zomato strike.Verma, as it turns out, has been working with Zomato for the last 14 months and is one of the delivery executives leading the protest. He is also, by his own admission, a BJP worker of many years.On being asked if the strike is politically motivated, both Shukla and Verma say it isn�t about the BJP and that it is just happenstance that some of the people leading the movement are affiliated with the party.In the picture below, released by news agency ANI, Shukla can be seen in a white shirt, as part of the group protesting against Zomato.During our conversation, too, Shukla got a call from one of the protesting Zomato delivery executives who apparently told him that the protesters were being called to meet the police.It was Shukla who then instructed the protesters over phone to not go and meet the police at the moment, displaying the command and leadership he has over the delivery personnel on strike.In fact, throughout the time this reporter was with them, it was Shukla, the local BJP leader, who called the shots and instructed Verma, the delivery executive and party worker.Also Read : 1857 Again?: Twitter On Zomato Execs Strike On Pork, Beef DeliveryOn asking Shukla and Verma about what prompted the protest, it becomes clear that one of the key motivations was to target Zomato, for having posted a tweet against communal bigotry.He was referring to Zomato�s 31 July tweet, posted in response to a man who did not want a Muslim delivery executive and had asked for a Hindu rider instead.�It�s because of what they tweeted,� says Shukla.Zomato�s tweet, posted on 31 July, was not directed at any religion and merely countered the bigotry displayed by one user named Amit Shukla.The company was, however, subjected to vicious trolling online and mass down-voting of its application in the app store, because a certain section of users claimed that the company�s response was �anti-Hindu�.The protesting Zomato delivery personnel say they began raising their demands from 3 August.In a state where serving both beef and pork is legal, and restaurants and food delivery apps have been doing so for a long time, it is no coincidence that the protests started soon after the Twitter controversy around secularism and bigotry.Also Read : After Zomato Episode, Row Over Linking Chicken to TN Brahmins�Verma and Shukla both claim that another reason behind the protest was that a new restaurant, named �New Real� on Belilious Road in Howrah, was to start serving and delivering beef on Zomato soon.The same claim was echoed, word for word, by Verma. But while there is a restaurant by that name in the locality, here are some facts about it that don�t match the claims made by the protesting Zomato delivery personnel.There is an existing branch of New Real Hotel on Belilious Road, owned by the family of a man named Mohd Aslam, which has been serving beef for a long time.The restaurant itself is more than five years old. The menu card mentions multiple beef dishes. Further, the New Real Hotel is available on both Zomato and Swiggy already.It is true that Aslam is opening a new branch of the restaurant in the same locality. But, this still doesn�t explain the following:These discrepancies further prove that the strike is serving as a means of backlash against Zomato.Verma claims that around 80 Zomato delivery executives have joined the protest. The beef and pork issue isn�t the only thing that has got these Zomato workers together. The other core demands include the shrinking payout the riders receive per order.The Zomato delivery personnel claim that the payout per order has gone down from Rs 70 to Rs 25. Now, they are demanding employee rights as well as a hike in payout fees.Zomato, meanwhile, argues that with the volume of orders increasing, the delivery partners still end up earning more on average. But the delivery personnel insist that they are not getting adequate remuneration.How has Zomato responded to the demands, of not making Hindu riders deliver beef dishes and Muslim riders deliver pork dishes?The delivery personnel claim that officials from Zomato are expected to meet them and discuss the matter on 16 August.West Bengal Minister and TMC MLA from Howrah, Rajib Banerjee, has reportedly spoken in favour of the protesting delivery personnel.""I too feel that the organisation performing such act should think about their action once again. They should not force any sect to go against the rules of their religion. This is very wrong. We had no idea about such actions. Since we have been approached, we shall surely take action against such deeds,"" Banerjee said, as per a India Today report.Also Read :  Cops Send Notice to Man Who Cancelled Zomato Order Over Religion(Hi there!

The BCI said it will focus on improving the existing institutions in the next three years, and colleges without proper infrastructure will be shut. The ban will not apply for any National Law University.",The New Indian Express,"HYDERABAD:��Stating that there are enough institutions in all parts of the country to feed law courts and serve the people, the Bar Council of India (BCI) on Monday imposed a three-year moratorium on opening new law colleges in the country. The BCI said that for the next three years it will focus on improving the existing institutions, and those which don�t have proper infrastructure will be shut.�There is no dearth of advocates and the existing institutions are sufficient to produce the required number of law graduates [...] there is an urgent need to improve the standard of teaching, and in order to achieve that goal, the Council has planned to train the law teachers of the country,� the BCI noted.BCI chairman Manan Kumar Mishra, in a press release, said the restriction will not apply for any national law university if proposed by any State government, if that State had no varsity before. The BCI, if it decides to open a model institution of legal education, as it did earlier by opening the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, could do so.�It was also resolved at the council meeting on August 11 that the BCI would consider only pending proposals for new institutions, and no fresh applications would be entertained. The reason, it said, was that there are about 1,500 law colleges in India and several don�t have proper infrastructure due to lethargy of the university managements and State governments.�There is an acute dearth of good law teachers�State governments grant �no objection certificates� (NOCs) and universities grant affiliations recklessly, and varsities are unable to stop the use of unfair practices at law examinations in most rural areas, the BCI said, adding that State governments do not show any interest in checking unfair practices.�Besides, due to negligence of the University Grants Commission (UGC), 90 per cent of law colleges do not get grants. Moreover, it is very easy to get LLM and PhD degrees because the HRD ministry and universities are indifferent, it said, adding that as a result, there is an acute dearth of �good law teachers� in the country. LLM and PhD degrees are not under the control of the BCI, and only approval/recognition of LLB degrees is within its domain, it added.The Council has requested State governments and universities to stop unfair practices and ensure the filling up of all vacancies of law teachers within four months. In 2016, the BCI decided to stop approving new law colleges, and requested the State governments not to grant NOCs to any new law college or university for two years. Universities were requested to stop granting affiliations to new colleges and to improve the standard of the existing institutions.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2019/aug/13/bar-council-of-india-introduces-three-year-moratorium-on-new-law-colleges-2018047.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This comes amid fall in demand for consumer goods, causing job cuts and production halts.",Reuters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India�s domestic passenger vehicle sales in July dived at the steepest pace in nearly two decades, an auto industry body said on Tuesday, as a financing crunch deepened a crisis in the country�s autos sector and triggered large-scale job losses.  Sales of passenger vehicles to car dealers plunged 30.9% to 200,790 in July, the ninth straight month of declines, data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) showed.  The drop in sales is the worst since December 2000, when the industry sold a fifth of the vehicles it sells currently. The crisis in the autos sector presents a major problem for Prime Minister Narendra Modi�s government, just as he begins his second term in office, as the sector accounts for nearly half of India�s manufacturing output. The auto industry employs over 35 million people directly and indirectly.  �If this industry goes down, then everything gets hurt. Manufacturing, jobs and revenue to the government,� Vishnu Mathur, director general, SIAM, told reporters on Tuesday, adding that car and motorcycle manufacturers have already slashed about 15,000 jobs. The pace of decline has accelerated in recent months, as a liquidity crunch in India�s shadow banking sector has dried up lines of credit to both auto dealers and potential car buyers. Reuters reported last week that companies in the sector - which includes manufacturers, auto parts makers and dealerships - have so far cut as many as 350,000 jobs.  The Indian unit of German auto parts maker Bosch Ltd told Indian exchanges on Tuesday it would restructure its operations and adjust workforce in the light of a sector slowdown. India�s jobless rate climbed to 7.51% in July from 5.66% a year earlier, according to private data group CMIE.  The latest auto sales figures imply that India�s GDP growth that has already slid to a near five-year low, is likely to show signs of further erosion for April-June when fresh data will be released later this month.  The downturn - regarded by industry executives as the worst ever suffered by the Indian auto industry - has already sent the    S&P BSE auto sector index tumbling more than 23% this year, while shares of the country�s top carmaker Maruti Suzuki have slumped more than 20% since the beginning of 2019. The domestic autos industry asked for tax breaks and easier access to finance for dealers and buyers at a meet with Indian government officials last week. �The data shows an urgent need for a revival package from the government. The industry is doing everything possible to increase sales, but it needs government support to prevent the crisis from worsening,� Mathur told reporters in New Delhi. Motorcycle and scooters sales fell 16.8% to about 1.51 million units, while passenger car sales dived 36% to 122,956 units, the data showed. Commercial vehicles sales plunged 25.7% to 56,866 units, SIAM said. The data also showed that domestic passenger vehicle production was down nearly 17% in the month. �We are hopeful of a revival package soon,� Mathur said.

5721,Shreyas Iyer better than Rishabh Pant for no. 4 spot in ODIs: Gavaskar,"Ex-India captain Sunil Gavaskar has said Shreyas Iyer is better suited for the number four batting spot in ODI cricket than Rishabh Pant and should be given a permanent slot in the middle-order. ""Pant is much better like...Dhoni at 5 or 6 as a finisher because that's where his natural game and natural flair will come into play,"" he added.",CricTracker,"The Indian Cricket Team�s No. 4 fiasco isn�t hidden from anyone. In the last 4 years, the team has tried the innumerable number of batsmen at that position, but not even a single lad has been able to cement his place. This has also very much weakened India�s middle order, which currently lacks stability. The team had to walk into the recently-concluded Cricket World Cup with the same middle order, which turned out to be really costly for the team.Nevertheless, the Men In Blue have eventually started to give long ropes to players after the World Cup catastrophe. Rishabh Pant has played at the much-talked No. 4 position, in all the five games India has been part of post the 50-over tournament. And as a result, the flamboyant wicketkeeper-batsman has also not disappointed the team management, as he struck a magnificent half-century in one of those games.AdvertisementThe No. 5 position now seems to be assigned to Shreyas Iyer, who was also shown glimpses of glory in the previous one-day match. However, the former Indian cricketer Gavaskar seems to disagree with this decision of the Indian team management.The fact that Pant is one of the best players of pace bowling in India, while, Iyer�s majority of strength lies against spinners, has made Sunil Gavaskar believe that the latter should ideally be batting at the 4th spot whilst the former can be demoted to the lower middle order.Expressing his views on this highly-talked topic, the former Indian skipper said, �In my view, Rishabh Pant is much better like an MS Dhoni at 5 for 6 as a finisher because that�s where his natural game and natural flair will come into play.��If India gets to a great start with Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma batting for 40-45 overs, then Pant at No. 4. But if it�s a question of batting for 30-35 overs, then I think it should be Shreyas Iyer at No. 4 and Pant at No. 5,�Going further, Sunil Gavaskar talked about Iyer�s skill-set and the consistency he has shown, every time he has been given the opportunities. The Mumbai-born also questioned the team management for its inability to show faith on a certain player and failure to pick talented players like Shreyas Iyer.�He [Sheryas Iyer] has grabbed his opportunity. He came at No. 5. He had plenty of overs. He had the company of his skipper, Virat Kohli. Nothing quite like it because the skipper takes the pressure off you. You learn from the best batsmen in the world. The best place to learn in cricket is the non-striker�s end. That�s what Shreyas Iyer was doing with Virat Kohli at the other end� the former batting great told Sony Ten 1.�I think, if this doesn�t help him get a more permanent slot in the Indian middle-order, I don�t know what will. In the 5 matches, he played before this, he scored 2 fifties and hit the highest score of 88. He hadn�t done anything wrong to be left out of the 14 (15) (World Cup). But that�s in the past. Now he has come back and scored a 71 in his first opportunity. So I think he will get a longer run.� He concluded.",https://www.crictracker.com/shreyas-iyer-should-be-batting-at-no-4-while-rishabh-pant-can-play-at-no-5-or-6-feels-sunil-gavaskar/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5726,Snap opens first India office in Mumbai to expand userbase,"Snapchat's parent firm Snap has launched its first office in India in Mumbai. Snap's Chief Strategy Officer Jared Grusd, who attended the launch, said that Snap is aiming to build a local team to boost new content creators, local publishers and media organisations. ""India is a strategic priority for Snap and...the company has headroom to grow,"" he added.",The Financial Express,"Snap Inc has opened its first Snapchat office in India with an aim to bring more localised content to the platform. Eyeing the promising Indian market, Snapchat opened an office in Mumbai earlier this week. The California-based communication app maker is planning to boost new content creators, local publishers and media organisations to bring stories, shows, lenses and more to its platform, reported Gadgets 360.The choice of the city is also very clever seeing as Mumbai is the financial and entertainment capital of the country and is home to several media and entertainment companies. Chief Strategy Officer Jared Grusd himself came to India for the launch of the Snap Mumbai office.Snapchat, which is a rival of Facebook-owned Instagram, has been looking to make waves in the Indian market for the last few months. In late July, the company had organised a Creator Summit in Mumbai bringing together more than 80 content creators that included Malini Agarwal of the MissMalini fame, TV comedian Gaurav Gera, Nagma Mirajkar among others. The move was aimed at wooing Indian users.Snapchat has steadily laid down the groundwork in the Indian market space. In April, the company had introduced support for four Indian languages � Hindi, Punjabi, Marathi and Gujarati- on its app. And as per the report by Gadgets 360, Snapchat is planning to bring five more Indian languages to the platform by the end of 2019. This will no doubt offer more localised content for the Indian users.It is interesting to note that in April 2017 Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel found himself in the eye of the storm when a report by Variety Magazine quoted him as saying that the app was only for rich people and not for poor countries like India or Spain. Spiegel was reported to have said, �I don�t want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.�So, what brought the change?The move is backed by a Google report which was published in 2018 that had emphasised the importance of Indian languages for apps such as Snapchat and forecasted that the Indian language Internet users will rise by a staggering 536 million by the year 2021.Snap has also made partnerships with platforms such as Gaana and JioSaavn, allowing its users to share their favourite music from the apps.Most notably, Snapchat in April grabbed headlines when it partnered with the Election Commission of India with its campaign in order to create awareness among the Indian voters with its tools and polling information.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market�s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

According to The News Minute report, ""the two sisters and their siblings used to sleep on the same bed and their parents wanted them to leave the world the same way, lying together.""",The News Minute,"On Monday morning, a small crowd gathered at the St Mary's Church in Bhoothanam in Malappuram district. The bodies of two young children were kept in caskets next to each other. While four-year-old Anagha's face was visible, her cousin, eight-year-old Aleena, was fully wrapped. The bodies were kept in the church for around an hour for people in the area to pay their respects; and then the two caskets with the two sisters were lowered into one grave.The two sisters and their siblings used to sleep on the same bed every night, hugging each other, and their parents wanted them to leave the world the same way � lying together.Anagha and Aleena died in the massive landslide that almost wiped off the tiny Kavalappara village, 25 km from Nilambur town. On Thursday night, the landslide destroyed almost 40 houses in the Muthappankunnu hill in Kavalappara. Victor and Thomma�s (Thomas) house was at the very top � there were no houses above theirs. The two brothers�� a carpenter and a painter���their wives, and five children, lived in the tiny house.When the ground beneath them gave way, Thomma was away. Victor and the two women ran, and managed to bring out three of the five children, including a two-month-old infant. But Anagha and Aleena were trapped.Within a couple of hours, Victor came back with a few others to look for the two girls. They could hear Aleena�s faint cries and started digging. ""They dug for many hours, but could not reach the kids,� says Ayyappan, a resident of Kavalappara, �Moreover, it was too dangerous.�Victor returned on Friday morning at 10 am to look for them once again, and they managed to pull out Anagha from the rubble. ""We thought she had a faint heartbeat and she was taken to one of the houses that had been unaffected,"" recalls Ayyappan.But before they could reach Aleena, a concrete slab that the girls were huddled under broke.For almost two to three hours after, there was no way to take Anagha to a hospital. The village had been cut off as the road leading to it had been completely flooded, and no one had any phone connectivity to reach the outside world. Anagha was moved to a hospital on Friday afternoon, but she had died by then.Thomma managed to reach his village around this time. Though his daughter had died, Thomma went with his brother to look for Aleena. Their efforts to remove the concrete slab from the roof of the house was not successful till Saturday morning. And by then, Aleena, too had died.""They knew the exact spot where they heard her cries. This is the only reason why we could dig and find her body,"" says Hari who works with the Kerala Fire and Rescue Services.So far, only 14 dead bodies, including those of the two girls, have been recovered from the site of the landslide � more than 55 bodies are believed to be under the rubble.�It was heartbreaking to see them lie in the caskets like that,� says Shijo Mathew, Victor�s friend who works in the church. �Victor and Thomma tried their best to save them, but they just could not. We could not save them.""The two sisters, who barely left each other�s side in life, were buried together in death.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kerala-landslide-sisters-who-hugged-each-other-sleep-every-night-buried-together-107090?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5738,Man Utd thrash Chelsea 4-0 as Lampard makes debut as PL manager,"Forward Marcus Rashford scored a brace as Manchester United defeated Chelsea 4-0 in their opening game of the Premier League 2019-20 season at Old Trafford. The win was Uniteds biggest over Chelsea in a top-flight match since their 4-0 victory in March, 1965. Further, it was Frank Lampards first competitive match as Chelsea manager.",Reuters,"MANCHESTER, England(Reuters) - Marcus Rashford struck twice as Manchester United opened their Premier League account with a resounding 4-0 victory over Frank Lampard�s Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday. It was an awful start for the new Chelsea boss in his first competitive game on the bench for his old club who struck the woodwork twice in the first half but paid for their defensive frailties as Anthony Martial and Dan James also scored. �Four mistakes for the goals. We have to be self-critical for that. We controlled the first half hour but made some poor decisions. We should be in the lead at the break,� said Lampard, who took over from Maurizio Sarri in the close season. �They have pace and if you turn over the ball and allow them to run in behind you they can hurt you. �We were comfortable in the first half. But there are lessons there. You can�t make mistakes at this level. But if you look at the game, it is not a 4-0 game,� added the former Chelsea and England midfielder. It may indeed have been a harsh scoreline for the visitors but for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer�s United team with Harry Maguire, the world�s most expensive defender, and right back Aaron Wan-Bissaka making debuts, it was a dream start to the campaign. The win was United�s biggest over Chelsea in a top-flight match since the same scoreline in March 1965 under Matt Busby. Not only did Rashford strike twice but his attacking partner Martial also found the target after the break and the victory was rounded off by substitute James, a close-season signing from Swansea City, marking his United debut with the fourth. �It is a great start for myself and the team. We rode our luck a bit first half but second we were much more ourselves,� said Maguire,� who joined United for 80 million pounds ($96.27 million) from Leicester City on Monday. �It is the first game at Old Trafford so I think there were nerves. We gave the ball away in dangerous areas. We moved it nicely second half and our front three are so dangerous on the break,� added the centre-half. But while the crowd celebrated their new-look side�s perfect start, it was evident until Martial made it 2-0 in the 65th that there is still much work to be done to get United anywhere near the level of title favourites Manchester City and Liverpool. The 41-year-old Lampard handed starts to youngsters Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham, back at the west London club after loan spells in the Championship (second-tier), with American Christian Pulisic on the bench, and his side started brightly. Abraham crashed an early drive against the United bar and Mount then tested David De Gea with an effort from distance. With Pedro and Ross Barkley causing problems in the channels, Chelsea were moving the ball with confidence and United�s midfield were often chasing shadows. But against the run of play the hosts got in front with an 18th minute Rashford penalty after the England forward was pulled down by Kurt Zouma. Chelsea responded well, however, and went close to an equaliser when Emerson struck the post shortly before the break with a left-foot drive from a tight angle. But the game turned decisively in United�s favour when, after a Rashford led counter-attack, Martial bundled in a low cross from Andreas Pereira. Two minutes later, Chelsea�s defence was again exposed when Rashford timed his run to perfection, latched on to a long ball from Paul Pogba and beat keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga with a confident finish. Another counter-attack led to United�s fourth goal when Pogba fed Welsh winger James who, after initially hesitating, fired into the far bottom corner via a deflection. That was the icing on the cake for United and, while the team remains a work in progress, the mood around Old Trafford was back to its jubilant best.

The black hole is over twice as large as the last record-making one at 10,000 times the mass of the black hole at the Milky Way's core. However, it's not the largest black hole ever 'detected'.",Engadget,"Astronomers aren't done with major black hole discoveries this year. The Max Planck Institute's Kianusch Mehrgan and colleagues have found the largest black hole ever observed at the center of Holm 15A, a galaxy about 700 million light-years away. It's more than twice as large as the previous observed record-setter at 40 billion times the mass of the Sun, and 10,000 times the mass of the black hole at the core of the Milky Way.The team spotted the black hole using data from the Very Large Telescope array. The wealth of extra data from the Chile observatory helped them map the structure of Holm 15A in unprecedented detail, helping them run simulations to explain the galaxy's formation and its unusually faint center. Simply speaking, the black hole is so powerful and large (its radius is about 790AU) that it has either swallowed up the closest stars or tossed them toward the galaxy's edge.This isn't necessarily the largest black hole detected. That distinction goes to the quasar TON 618 -- indirect studies suggest its black hole could be 66 billion times the Sun's mass. It's still gigantic, though, and it's about four to nine times larger than astronomers expected.

The locals alleged that the slush from the uranium mine in Tummalapalle enters farms and other water sources, and affects their livelihood.",The News Minute,"Activists in Andhra Pradesh have written to the state's Pollution Control Board (PCB), accusing it of turning a blind eye towards alleged violations by the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) at its uranium mine and processing plant set up at Tummalapalle.Several locals from the region, including those belonging to the villages of Mabbuchintalapalli, Bhumayagaripalli and Kanumalavaripalli, have staged protests against the mine in the past.Locals allege that the uranium mine�s tailing pond is prone to leaks. The tailing pond is a wet storage area where the by-products that are discharged from the mine are transported by a pipeline for containment. They say this slush then enters farms and other water sources, thereby affecting their livelihood.""Unfortunately, APPCB has remained a mute spectator all these years. It has not even dared to identify the source of contamination and conclusively determine the violations by UCIL. APPCB appears to have forgotten that its primary responsibility is to protect the environment and the people and not shield the polluters. UCIL has simply ignored the presence of APPCB as a regulator and has been going ahead with whatever they want to do,"" the activists said in their representation to PCB Member Secretary and IAS officer Vivek Yadav.Those who signed the letter to the PCB include retired Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) scientist Dr Babu Rao, Professor M Adinarayana from Osmania University and several others including Dr K Venkat Reddy, Dr A V Rao, Dr M Bapuji, Dr C R Panda, Dr JM Mohanty and Dr A Srinivasa Rao.They pointed out that while the District Collector and the local MP, YS Avinash Reddy, had held meetings with the locals, the PCB representative was missing.""Is the matter merely limited to paying compensation for loss of agriculture? Will the contamination continue without any measures to check and stop it? Now the contamination spread to mainly three villages and soon it will spread to larger area causing permanent poisoning of groundwater. We are distressed at APPCB being unable to even fix the responsibility for groundwater pollution and allowing the company to get away with blaming natural causes,"" the letter added.""For whose development are the poor people of Kadapa being sacrificed?"" the letter asked.The activists also attached a letter written by Kadapa MP Y S Avinash Reddy last year, which was addressed to UCIL Chairman and Managing Director C K Asnani, which stated, ""We are able to see an attempt by UCIL to cover up its lapses in a highly unprofessional and unethical manner.""Stating that ""falsehoods are least expected from professional engineers and scientists"", Avinash wrote, ""I am having tough time pacifying the affected people to wait for justice. You cannot go on denying your responsibility for taking advantage of a meek regulatory system. You are hitting at the very livelihoods of the people and playing with their lives...I urge you to act at least now to correct the situation.""The UCIL meanwhile, has been denying the allegations and claiming that the higher salinity and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) content in groundwater samples from the region could be linked to the operations of UCIL and said that 'scientific evidence' was yet to be found.�On the basis of detailed scientific studies, no significant anomaly has been reported on the quality of groundwater collected from monitoring wells constructed around the tailing ponds in line with the international practices,"" a statement issued by them last year had said.�Read:�Tummalapalle uranium plant: UCIL officials meet Andhra farmers, deny contaminationGround report: The lost livelihoods and displacement at AP�s Tummalapalle uranium mine",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/activists-write-pollution-control-board-over-violations-uranium-mine-andhra-107091?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The couple throws chairs on the burglars even as the masked men brandish sickles.",The News Minute,"70-year-old Shanmugavel, a resident of Kalyanipuram in Kadaiyam, is sitting at a table at the entrance of his house when a masked intruder is seen slowly sneaking up behind him. As the unknowing elderly man reaches out to pick up a piece of paper kept in front of him, the intruder pulls him back with a piece of cloth around his neck, trying to choke him. Caught in a deadly grip, Shanmugavel struggles to get free as the door of the house opens and his wife,�65-year-old Senthamarai, comes out running. At the same time, another masked intruder appears on the screen.Over the next 45 seconds, the elderly couple shows tremendous bravery. Shanmugavel's wife acted quickly. She grabs slippers kept at the door and starts throwing them one by one at the intruder trying to strangle her husband. Meanwhile, Shanmugavel tries to break free and hits the other intruder. As the slippers hit the robber, he falters and Shanmugavel falls off his chair, gets up, picks up a plastic chair and flings it at the burglars.�The intruders then pull out sickles, ready to strike the couple.�But before they could even gather themselves, Shanmugavel and his wife throw furniture at them � chairs, stools and everything they can find in their vicinity. As one robber backs away, the second continues to raise the sickle and threateningly approach the couple. But the couple is relentless and both Shanmugavel and his wife bring one chair after another upon him, even breaking a plastic green stool on his head. At one point, Shanmugavel can be seen fighting with a broken plastic leg of the stool against the robber�s sickle.�The intruders had no choice but to beat a hasty retreat.The video of the incident, which took place at 9 pm on Sunday, is going viral on social media and the couple is being praised for their courage and quick-thinking.�Speaking to TNM, Shanmugavel reveals that the couple was prepared to handle intruders in their residence.�""We live in a farmhouse at the edge of the village and it is located very close to the forest. It is a five-acre land and we have been here for 40 years. We were acutely aware of the fact that we were susceptible to attacks from robbers because our house was isolated from the rest of the village,"" he says. ""When I was getting strangled, I immediately began to make loud noises to get my wife's attention. I knew it didn't have to make sense. It just had to bring her to the entrance,"" he says.�Senthamarai appears completely unperturbed by the previous night's attack. She merely laughs when this reporter expresses awe at her act of bravery. When asked how she reacted almost immediately to the attack, by throwing footwear at the first intruder, she says, ""Because I love my husband of course. How can I bear to watch when someone is hurting him?"" she asks.�The couple is very amused at the praise that the video of their brave act is getting.�""I have always been bold, right from a young age,"" says Senthamarai, dismissing any incredulity over the fight. ""I knew we had to fight back and when we did, the intruders actually got scared. One of them hurt my hand with the sickle and in that gap, managed to steal my gold thaali, which was four sovereigns. But my husband is unhurt and I am happy we chased the intruders away,"" she adds.�While the local police have filed an FIR, the accused are yet to be identified and arrested.��",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/video-elderly-tn-couple-bravely-fends-armed-robbers-plastic-chairs-107105?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Sumit Maniyar, Founder and CEO, Rupeek, said, Rupeek claims it is currently disbursing gold loans at an annual run rate of more than $150 million and is growing 20 percent month-on-month. Started in 2015 as an asset-backed lending marketplace, Rupeek leverages technology to operate with a branchless model and passes the benefit of lower operational costs to the end customer. The startup counts banks like Federal Bank and Karur Vysya Bank as its trusted lending partners.

India currently holds 27000 tonnes of gold worth more than $1 trillion, out of which only six to seven percent is monetised through the organised market. The unorganised market is estimated to be three times the size of the organized gold loan market. Currently, India imports 750 tonnes of gold annually without contributing to the GDP multiplier as most of the imported gold sits idle in the form of jewelry. Rupeek believes that gold loans can be an effective gold monetization mechanism.In February 2018, the startup secured $6.8 million in Series A funding round led by Accel Partners.(Edited by Megha Reddy)",https://yourstory.com/2019/08/fintech-startup-rupeek-funding-bertelsmann-india-accel-sequoia?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The sector itself is growing at a rate of 25% year-over-year, it added.",YourStory,"According to a report unveiled by NASSCOM on Monday, India currently hosts more than 450 startups in the agritech sector, growing at a rate of 25 percent year-on-year.The report titled ""Agritech in India � Emerging Trends in 2019� says that the sector has received more than $248 million in funding as of June 2019, a massive growth of 300 percent as compared to the previous year. With the recent rise in funding, 48 percent Agritech CEOs, as per the NASSCOM Agritech CEO survey, believe to have the next Agritech unicorn in the coming three years. Sharing her thoughts, Debjani Ghosh, President, NASSCOM said, With more and more local farmers accepting the innovative startup solutions, there has been a considerable shift witnessed from B2C to B2B startups. Corporates and investors are playing a vital role in supporting this with over $200 million investment in B2B startups in the past 18 months, making it as a key revenue generating segment in the overall agritech sector. According to the report, in the last five years, more than five global agritech companies have ventured in India, as compared to more than 25 Indian agritech companies with global presence. New emerging areas like market linkage, digital agriculture, better access to inputs, FaaS and financing are attracting large traction and enabling agritech startups to bring forth farming-related advanced technological mechanisms to help local farming become a sustainable and profit-yielding enterprise. With public private partnerships and government support, several Indian states have established progressive agritech policies with an aim to boost the industry. However, certain measures such as setting up of catalytic or micro funds (ranging  $2-14 million ) to spur innovation, offer support in terms of incubation, acceleration, and catalytic funding, opening of incubation centres, curriculum changes in agriculture universities, building of a transparent data sharing policy, and engaging with startups in larger projects, needs to be implemented by state governments to further enhance the use of futuristic technologies and support the growing agritech sector in the country, the report added.It is estimated that by 2020, the agritech sector to be at the center-stage of innovation and will lead India's journey towards overall transformation. Therefore, to achieve this goal, the ecosystem needs to focus towards driving innovation, data collaboration, easy working capital and providing digital infrastructure to enable real time access to farmers across the country.Recently, Netherlands-based lender Rabobank and Indian impact investor Caspian have also announced the launch of a Rabo-Caspian Agtech Financing Fund with a pilot corpus of Rs 15 crore. The fund will provide customised debt solutions to companies operating in the agritech space in India.

5783,US turning Gulf region into a 'matchbox ready to ignite': Iran,"Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Monday accused the US of turning the Gulf region into a ""matchbox ready to ignite"", saying that ""the US and its allies are flooding it with weapons"". The Gulf waterway ""is narrow, it will become less safe as foreign (navy) vessels increase their presence in it,"" he said.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused the United States on Monday of turning the Gulf region into a �matchbox ready to ignite�, according to Al Jazeera television. Oil tanker traffic passing through the Gulf via the Strait of Hormuz has become the focus of a U.S.-Iranian standoff since Washington pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions to strangle Tehran�s oil exports. After explosions that damaged six tankers in May and June and Iran�s seizure of a British-flagged tanker in July, the United States launched a maritime security mission in the Gulf, joined by Britain, to protect merchant vessels. Zarif, in interview remarks cited by Qatar-based Al Jazeera, said the Strait �is narrow, it will become less safe as foreign (navy) vessels increase their presence in it�. �The region has become a matchbox ready to ignite because America and its allies are flooding it with weapons,� he said. Zarif, who arrived on Sunday in Doha, met on Monday with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani for talks to convey that message, Iranian state-run media reported.  Qatar, which hosts one of the biggest U.S. military bases in the Middle East, is trying not to be drawn into the escalating conflict between Washington and Tehran. Iraq, which maintains good relations with both Washington and Tehran, cautioned on Monday that the deployment of Western forces was fueling regional tension. �The states of the Gulf can together secure the transit of ships,� Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Hakim said on Twitter. �Iraq is seeking to reduce tension in our region through calm negotiations...The presence of Western forces in the region will increase tension,� he said. Last month, Iran�s Revolutionary Guards seized the British tanker, Stena Impero near the Strait for alleged marine violations, two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian oil tanker near Gibraltar, accusing it of violating sanctions on Syria. The tanker dispute has tangled Britain in the diplomatic dispute between the EU�s big powers - which want to preserve the Iran nuclear deal - and the United States which has pushed for a tougher policy on Iran.

The deadline to submit EoIs was August 10.",The Financial Express,"Gulf carrier Etihad, which holds 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways, on Monday said it has decided not to reinvest in the airline due to unresolved issues concerning liabilities.�Jet Airways, which shuttered operations on April 17, is undergoing insolvency proceedings and at least three entities have put in initial bids for the carrier. In a statement, Etihad said it declined to lodge an Expression of Interest (EoI) to reinvest in Jet Airways because of unresolved issues concerning the airline�s liabilities. The deadline for submission of EoIs was August 10. While noting that it was �neither feasible for nor responsible of Etihad to reinvest in Jet Airways at this time, Etihad asserted that the decision does not affect its commitment to India.�Since then, Etihad has consistently and constructively sought and advanced solutions to help resolve Jet�s issues. But as a minority shareholder, Etihad has had limited capacity to secure required changes,� the statement said. The national carrier of the UAE picked up 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways in 2013. Earlier this year, Etihad said it made a conditional expression of interest to reinvest in the Indian airline as a minority stakeholder, with an agreed partner, but unfortunately, this did not materialise.��Etihad remained engaged in the process, but despite the endeavours of everyone involved, there remained very significant issues relating to Jet�s previous liabilities,� the statement noted. �Regrettably, in these circumstances, it was neither feasible for nor responsible of Etihad to reinvest in Jet at this time. This decision is unrelated to and does not affect Etihad�s continued commitment to India, the airline�s largest single market, and one which it has served for 15 years,� it said.According to the statement, Etihad flies between Abu Dhabi and 10 destinations in India and is continually increasing the frequency of its flights, the size of its aircraft, the quality of its product and the international route connections it offers beyond its hub in Abu Dhabi.   On Sunday, mining baron Anil Agarwal�s investment company Volcan Investments said it has shown interest in acquiring a stake in Jet Airways.

The Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP), existing unauthenticated in both wired and wireless modes, is especially vulnerable to malware attacks, researchers said. They demonstrated a way to encrypt photos and display a ransom demand to unlock them.",Engadget,"Cameras are among the few devices that don't connect to the internet, so you'd think they'd be immune to hackers. However, researchers have discovered that some DSLRs and mirrorless cameras are actually vulnerable to ransomware attacks, of all things. Once in range of your camera's WiFi, a bad actor could easily install malware that would encrypt your valuable photos unless you paid for a key.Check Point Software noticed that the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) -- which is unauthenticated in both wired and wireless modes -- is particularly vulnerable to malware attacks. Ironically, they were able to uncover flaws in the Canon EOS 80D by using firmware originally cracked by Magic Lantern, which supplies its own open source app with extra features to Canon EOS owners.In a video, the researchers showed how they first set up a rogue WiFi access point. Once the attackers were range of the camera, they ran an exploit to access the camera's SD card and encrypt any photos. The surprised owner would then see a message that his pictures are no longer available unless he's willing to pay a ransom. Check Point notes that cameras are a great attack target because they contain valuable personal photos that folks would be willing to pay for. It disclosed the vulnerability to Canon in March, and last week, Canon issued an advisory telling folks to avoid unsecured WiFi, turn off network functions and install a new security patch.The issue affects most of Canon's camera lineup, from the EOS 70D to the mirrorless EOS R. It might not be limited to Canon, either, as Check Point told The Verge that other manufacturers, which use the same PTP protocol, could also be vulnerable.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/12/dslr-camera-ransomware-vulnerability/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

(Image: NASA)And today, his efforts have indeed paid off. A month ago, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), launched Chandrayaan-2, India�s successful mission to the South Pole of the Moon, becoming the first country to do so.Following the successful launch of Sputnik by Russia, Sarabhai impressed upon the government the need for a comprehensive space programme.He started the Indian National Committee for Space Research in 1962, which later became the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Under his leadership, the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station was established in Kerala, with a successful launch in 1963. The first Indian satellite Aryabhatta was also sent into orbit in 1975.He also played a major role in the setting up of renowned institutes like IIM-Ahmedabad, and Physical Research Laboratory, which is a National Research Institute for Space and Allied Sciences in Ahmedabad.Vikram Sarabhai believed firmly in the need for communication and education, especially of those living in rural areas, whom he wanted to reach out to via satellites. In 1966, he requested NASA to design an experimental satellite communication project, known as Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE).The programme, launched in 1975, aimed to make television and other informational programmes available to rural India. It also helped India gain technical knowledge and experience in the field of satellite communications.An ISRO technician standing next to a working model of the solid-state television set, designed with NASA assistance, for use in SITE (Satellite Instructional Television Experiment).(Image: NASA)The programme, which ran for a year from 1975-76, was quite a success as it covered over 2,400 villages in 20 districts. The project was also supported by international committees like UNESCO, UNICEF, ITU, and UNDP, and also led to the birth of All India Radio (AIR).Besides ISRO, Sarabhai also led the Atomic Energy Commission between 1966 and 1971 as its Chairman. The Community Space Centre set up by him in Ahmedabad was later renamed as the Vikram A Sarabhai Community Science Centre.That�s not all, the ongoing mission, Chandrayaan-2, has one of its payloads named after him, the Vikram Lander, which will move around on the lunar surface after touchdown.(Edited by Rekha Balakrishnan)",https://yourstory.com/2019/08/isro-google-doodle-vikram-sarabhai-chandrayaan-2?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5828,There should be another umpire on ground for no-balls: Dean Jones,"Ex-Australia batsman Dean Jones has said there should be another umpire on the ground for calling no-balls. Adding that the umpire should stand behind the non-striker, Jones said, ""The main umpire can't see a no-ball most of the time because the bowler's right hip covers their front foot."" ""What's the cost of an extra umpire compared to technology?"" he asked.",Cricket Country,"As good as a cricket player Australia�s Dean Jones was in the 1980s, he is equally good when it comes to innovations and cricketing tactics, and the former cricketer-turned coach and commentator believes that adding an extra umpire on the field to call no-balls, instantaneously, could be one of the methods to reduce umpires missing out on calling no-balls.In an interview to the official website of Global T20 Canada, Jones flouted the idea of having an extra umpire right behind the non-striker to call no-balls by the bowlers immediately rather that relying in technology, which according to Jones will cost money and leads to delay in play.ALSO SEE: JP Duminy-spurred Winnipeg eliminate Yuvraj Singh�s Nationals, Vancouver reach final�We need another umpire on the ground. Now why? Because there are too many no-balls that are being missed in every game.�Now, the technology you need for a no-ball � the infra-red and all that they do for tennis � costs money,� Jones said adding, �And it�s not instantaneous. Let me tell you why that matters. If I�m the coach of Islamabad United and I have one of my batsman, say Andre Russell, on strike. If he takes a single, goes to the other end, and then the technology comes back and says �that was a no-ball� � I don�t want Andre Russell taking that single. He is the biggest hitter in the game. He needs to be on strike. So we need instantaneous calls.�The 58-year-old went to explain the best position for such umpire will be behind the non-striker to get an unobstructed view of the bowlers front and back foot. Jones also added that more often than not the umpire view, standing behind the wicket at the non-striker�s end, is obstructed due the incoming bowler�s movement, mostly hip movement, while delivering the ball.�My first logical thought is that he stands behind the non-striker. He can see straight away if it�s a no-ball. The main umpire can�t see a no-ball most of the time because the bowler�s right hip covers their front foot. So the umpires are guessing sometimes. But if an umpire stands behind the non-striker, he�ll see everything. Back foot, front foot, everything. And you know what? What�s the cost of an extra umpire compared to the technology? So I want to have another umpire down there,� he added.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/dean-jones-bats-for-extra-umpire-to-call-no-balls-instantaneously-in-t20s-878370?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Roskomnadzor added Russia will see Google as interfering in its sovereign affairs if it fails to comply.",Reuters,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia�s state communications watchdog has asked Google (GOOGL.O) to stop advertising �illegal mass events� on its YouTube video platform, it said on Sunday. Tens of thousands of Russians staged what observers called the country�s biggest political protest for eight years on Saturday, defying a crackdown to demand free elections to Moscow�s city legislature. Multiple YouTube channels broadcast the event live.  The watchdog, Roscomnadzor, said some entities had been buying advertising tools from YouTube, such as push notifications, in order to spread information about illegal mass protests, including those aimed at disrupting elections.    It said Russia would consider a failure by Google to respond to the request as �interference in its sovereign affairs� and �hostile influence (over) and obstruction of democratic elections in Russia�. If the company does not take measures to prevent events from being promoted on its platforms, Russia reserves the right to respond accordingly, Roscomnadzor said, without giving details.

Rosatom said five of its staff members were killed and three others injured in the blast, which took place during a rocket test on a sea platform. The rocket�s fuel caught fire after the test, causing it to detonate and the explosion threw several people into the sea, it said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.�Searches continued as long as there was hope to find survivors,� Interfax news agency cited Rosatom as saying.There were no further details of the rocket or fuel type.In a separate statement Rosatom said the accident occurred during the engineering and technical support of �isotope power sources� on a liquid propulsion system.

He has been ruled out of the second Test at Lord�s but says should he recover, he will won�t rush back to international cricket without getting some match practice.�I�m sure if I do manage to come back in this series then I�ll have to play some sort of cricket beforehand.

""I wanted to sometimes just run away from it,"" said Surveen.",Times Now,"While in Season 1, we only got a glimpse of Jojo, played by Surveen Chawla�in Sacred Games, Season 2 will let viewers explore the character in all its entirety, at least that's what is�expected. If the promos of the show are anything to go by, Surveen�s character looks like a shrewd, headstrong woman, who didn�t fear Ganesh Gaitonde, one of the primary characters in the show, played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. But essaying the role of Jojo has not been easy for Surveen.The actress recently revealed that she was pregnant while shooting for the show, and it was exhausting for her to work on the character, primarily because of the fact that Jojo was a character that was �damaged� to the core.�It was difficult to play Jojo at a time when I was pregnant. You are trying to find an end to your emotions and you don't have it. It is not the best place to be in when you are pregnant. I wanted to sometimes just run away from it,� she told PTI.
Surveen�s character appeared in the first shot of the first season of Sacred Games, but not much is revealed about it in the subsequent episodes, barring a few mentions. But it seems, the backstory of Jojo will come to the fore in Season 2. It surely seems like an important character and fans can�t wait to know more about it.
Sacred Games is based on Vikram Chandra's novel by the same name. It was the first Netflix original series in India, and the second season will go up on August 15.

The 37-year-old, who is aiming for her fourth Rogers Cup title, won the semi-final match with a scoreline of 1-6, 6-3, 6-3. Serena will face Canada's 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu in the final.",Reuters,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Serena Williams rallied to avoid a stunning upset and secure a 1-6 6-3 6-3 semi-final win over Czech qualifier Marie Bouzkova at the Rogers Cup on Saturday, setting up a title showdown with local teenager Bianca Andreescu. Williams was in a battle from the outset against the 21-year-old Czech, who showed no nerves despite playing her first WTA semi-final against a player who was her role model growing up. Bouzkova quickly went up a double-break for a 4-1 lead and sealed the first set in 29 minutes but Williams quickly made the necessary adjustments and got her first break of the match to go ahead 4-3 in the second before forcing a decider. The consistency that Bouzkova displayed early in the match suddenly started to fade and when Williams broke to go ahead 3-1 in the third set, it all but brought an end to the Czech�s impressive Toronto run. �She just did everything well, she had a really good game plan and she was moving great,� said Williams.  �I just had to make some adjustments, mostly mentally to stay positive.� Bouzkova�s week included wins over 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens, former French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko and a clash with Wimbledon champion Simona Halep, who retired hurt after dropping the first set of their quarter-final. Williams arrived in Toronto hoping to get plenty of hardcourt matches in before going for a record-equaling 24th career Grand Slam title at the Aug. 26-Sept. 8 U.S. Open.

5894,Harry Kane scores two late goals as Tottenham beat Villa 3-1,Tottenham Hotspur forward Harry Kane scored twice in the last five minutes to help his side secure a 3-1 victory against newly-promoted Aston Villa in Premier League on Saturday. The match also witnessed Tottenham's record signing Tanguy Ndombele score in his competitive debut for the club with the 73rd-minute equaliser. John McGinn scored Villa's only goal in the ninth minute.,Reuters,"Harry Kane got straight into the groove with two late goals as Tottenham Hotspur recovered from an early setback to beat promoted Aston Villa 3-1 at home on Saturday. Villa, back in the top flight after three seasons away, looked set to mark their return in style as they hung on tenaciously to John McGinn�s ninth-minute opener. But Tottenham�s record signing Tanguy Ndombele fired home a debut goal in the 73rd minute to break Villa�s resistance. With Villa visibly tiring captain Jack Grealish conceded possession on the edge of his area in the 86th minute and when the ball fell to Kane he made no mistake. Kane rubbed salt into Villa�s wounds with a classy finish in the 90th minute as Tottenham, playing their first opening fixture at home for eight seasons, took the points. Spurs had dominated possession but it was only when playmaker Christian Eriksen, who could still be on the move before the transfer windows close in Spain, Italy and Germany, replaced Harry Winks did Villa really start to creak. �We came out in the second half with a high tempo, pressed well,� Kane said. �When Tanguy (Ndombele) got his goal it was full throttle until the end. �Thankfully, a couple of chances fell to me.� Villa signed 12 players for a total of 130 million pounds  ($156 million) in the transfer window as they seek to establish themselves back with elite. But it was Scottish striker McGinn, a regular in last season�s side who were promoted via the playoffs, who sparked delirium in the away end. Latching on to a long ball by Tyrone Mings, he calmly fired past Hugo Lloris as covering defender Danny Rose slipped. Tottenham huffed and puffed and were far too slow in possession as Villa coped admirably before the break. Kane headed over just before the interval but Tottenham�s frustration was clear as they trudged off at halftime. Tottenham laid siege to the Villa goal and the equaliser finally arrived in the 73rd minute. Villa keeper Tom Heaton made a great save to deny Davinson Sanchez but when the ball was fed back to Ndombele by Lucas Moura he picked out the corner of the goal. Eriksenn tested Heaton with a free kick but Villa could not get out of their own area. Grealish was caught in possession by Erik Lamela and the Argentine�s scuffed shot fell kindly for Kane who made no mistake. Sissoko then found Kane who beat Heaton with a clinical finish. �It was a difficult first half,� Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said. �The first 45 minutes wasn�t the best. But in the second half we started to create more chances, but it was still difficult because they defended so deep.� Despite the dejection at the end, Villa will take heart from their display. �When you keep giving it away and have to chase it become a hard game,� Villa boss Smith said. �We got a dream start but there is no doubt the better team won on the day.� ($1 = 0.8310 pounds) Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond",https://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-tot-ava-report/kane-scores-late-double-to-give-spurs-win-over-villa-idINKCN1V00Q3?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

5901,British would be big losers in case of no-deal Brexit: EU's Juncker,"European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said, ""If it comes to a hard Brexit...the British would be the big losers."" ""We are fully prepared even though some in Britain say we are not well set up for a 'no-deal',"" he added. Earlier, UK PM Boris Johnson said the UK must leave the EU on October 31.",Reuters,"VIENNA (Reuters) - A no-deal Brexit would hurt Britain more than the rest of Europe no matter how much Prime Minister Boris Johnson�s government pretends otherwise, outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in remarks published on Saturday. Britain has been pressing the European Union to amend the terms of Britain�s withdrawal agreement, saying Brussels would have to take responsibility for a no-deal Brexit if it does not compromise. But at the end of the day that would do the most harm to Britain, Juncker told a regional newspaper in the Austrian province of Tyrol, where he regularly spends his summer holiday. �If it comes to a hard Brexit, that is in no one�s interest, but the British would be the big losers. They are acting as though that were not the case but it is,� Juncker told the Tiroler Tageszeitung newspaper. �We are fully prepared even though some in Britain say we are not well set up for a �no deal�. But I am not taking part in these little summer games,� said Juncker, who is due to be succeeded by German conservative Ursula von der Leyen once she has put together her Commission. The European Union has said the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the previous British administration led by Theresa May will not be re-opened. Johnson says it wants a key element of that deal, the so-called Irish �backstop�, to be scrapped. The backstop, agreed between Brussels and May�s government, aims to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland open, and would effectively keep Northern Ireland within the EU�s single market if no alternative arrangement can be found. �We have made clear that we are not prepared to hold new negotiations on the withdrawal agreement but only to make certain clarifications in the framework of the political declarations that regulate future relations between the United Kingdom and European Union,� Juncker said. �We are well prepared (for no deal) and I hope the British are too.�     Reporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Stephen Powell",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-juncker/eus-juncker-tells-britain-no-deal-brexit-will-hurt-you-the-most-idUSKCN1V00ME?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

If you used Amazon�s Elastic Block Storage snapshots, you might want to check your settings.New research just presented at the Def Con security conference reveals how companies, startups and governments are inadvertently leaking their own files from the cloud.You may have heard of exposed S3 buckets � those Amazon-hosted storage servers packed with customer data but often misconfigured and inadvertently set to �public� for anyone to access. But you may not have heard about exposed EBS snapshots, which poses as much, if not a greater, risk.These elastic block storage (EBS) snapshots are the �keys to the kingdom,� said Ben Morris, a senior security analyst at cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox, in a call with TechCrunch ahead of his Def Con talk. EBS snapshots store all the data for cloud applications. �They have the secret keys to your applications and they have database access to your customers� information,� he said.�When you get rid of the hard disk for your computer, you know, you usually shredded or wipe it completely,� he said. �But these public EBS volumes are just left for anyone to take and start poking at.�He said that all too often cloud admins don�t choose the correct configuration settings, leaving EBS snapshots inadvertently public and unencrypted. �That means anyone on the internet can download your hard disk and boot it up, attach it to a machine they control, and then start rifling through the disk to look for any kind of secrets,� he said.One of Morris� Def Con slides explaining how EBS snapshots can be exposed.

Once he validates each snapshot, he deletes the data.Morris found dozens of snapshots exposed publicly in one region alone, he said, including application keys, critical user or administrative credentials, source code and more. He found several major companies, including healthcare providers and tech companies.He also found VPN configurations, which he said could allow him to tunnel into a corporate network. Morris said he did not use any credentials or sensitive data, as it would be unlawful.Among the most damaging things he found, Morris said he found a snapshot for one government contractor, which he did not name, but provided data storage services to federal agencies. �On their website, they brag about holding this data,� he said, referring to collected intelligence from messages sent to and from the so-called Islamic State terror group to data on border crossings.�Those are the kind of things I would definitely not want to be exposed to the public internet,� he said.He estimates the figure could be as many as 1,250 exposures across all Amazon cloud regions.

5988,Indian food delivery market very competitive: Uber CEO Dara,"Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, at the ride-hailing giant's quarterly earnings call, acknowledged that the food delivery platform Uber Eats is behind Swiggy and Zomato in India. ""The market is very, very competitive. We want to be number one or number two in every single market,"" he said. ""The team knows there's a big lift ahead of them,"" he added.",The New Indian Express,"Global taxi-hailing platform Uber is having a hard time cracking the food delivery business in India, with the company trailing third behind home-grown rivals Swiggy and Zomato. To make matters worse, the US-based cab aggregator�s discounts and incentives to drive traffic in the segment has been putting a significant dent in its global margins.According to company officials, including its global chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi and chief financial officer Nelson Chai, the firm has recorded lower margins in its UberEATS business in India compared to its core taxi-hailing operations. This was one of the reasons contributing to the company�s $5.2 billion net loss for the April to June quarter, analysts noted, adding that Uber had taken a similar hit the previous quarter too when it had posted a USD 1 billion net loss.Uber�s troubles with the rapidly growing Indian food delivery business arise primarily from the intense competition for the market, with both established players � Swiggy and Zomato �- holding a large market share and ramping up investments. �... the market is very, very competitive. We usually aim to be number one or number two in any market, but we are number three here now,� Khosrowshahi said during an analysts� call after the results announcement.The tussle for customer and partner acquisition has forced Uber to keep doling out incentives for its driver and restaurant partners and discounts for its customers, bringing its global food business margins (take-rate) nearly a 100 basis points lower. According to Chai, Uber�s food business take-rate stood at around 10.2 per cent globally during the quarter, but �ex-India, probably would have been another 100 basis points or so�.However, both executives dismissed reports that the company is looking to sell its UberEATS business in the country, stating that it continues to operate in India. Khosrowshahi also told analysts that the management believes UberEATS India can meet the same success as its core cab-hailing business. �We proved our ability to win in rides, and my expectation is the same on Eats...

The industry is not 100 per cent secular. It's polarized. This is a fact of life,"" John quipped when asked if the industry was a fair playing ground, with rampant divisive mood brewing all around.John was at an event to promote his upcoming flick ""Batla House"" in Mumbai when he expressed the opinion.""The problem is that the world is polarized. There is a dialogue in my film, �It is not that a particular community is suffering, the entire world is suffering'. Look at (Donald) Trump, look at Brexit, look at Boris Johnson - the world is polarized today. You are living in this world, so, you have to deal with it. At the same time, I feel this is the best country and the best industry,"" he said.The 46-year-old actor believes social media should not be taken seriously because those who troll, do not have a face.�Talking about people sharing irresponsible statements on social media, John said: ""Mostly you see all this on social media because when you are sitting in an audience, there is something that actually controls our emotions and keeps us at bay from making irresponsible statements. On social media, none of us really have a face, which is why you will see the most toxic statements emerge. Do not believe in social media.""John's upcoming movie ""Batla House"" is inspired by Delhi's Batla House encounter case of 2008, and is set to clash with Akshay Kumar's ""Mission Mangal"" at the box office on Independence Day.�Talking about the clash, John said: ""I think the good thing is that there are two very credible films releasing (on the same day). Talking about business, there is enough business for two films on that day - both Akshay and I know that. I think it's a great day for the audience, they are the winners because they get to choose from two very good films.""Talking about his film, John added: ""�Batla House' is an edge-of-the-seat thriller. So, even if you don't care about the incident, the film still works for you. Credit to (director) Nikkhil (Advani), and (writer) Ritesh (Shah) who have put four years of research into the film. Not only do you have a thriller, but when you walk out of the theatre, you will scratch your head and marvel at the fact that this was also true.""About the Bollywood trend of adapting true incidents onto the screen, he said: ""Be it �Article 15', �Super 30' or �Uri', I think we are telling good stories now. I would want to believe that �Batla House' is one of those exceptionally good stories being told. I don't think it is a trend. I feel, you should do what you really believe in. So, if you want to make a story on a real-life character or incident, you make it. If you want to tell a fictitious story, do it. Everything works.""""Batla House"" directed by Nikkhil Advani also stars Mrunal Thakur, Ravi Kishan and Rajesh Sharma in key roles.

6002,Postpone Maharashtra polls to next year: Raj Thackeray,"MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Saturday sought postponement of the upcoming Maharashtra Assembly polls, scheduled later this year, to next year due to the devastation caused by floods in the state. ""I would also write to the poll panel on the issue,"" he said. Thackeray accused BJP and Shiv Sena of not taking timely cognizance of the flood-situation in Maharashtra.",The Financial Express,"Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray on Saturday sought deferment of the upcoming Assembly polls, due in September-October, to the next year citing the large scale devastation caused by floods in western region of the state. Observing that it would take time to restore normalcy in the flood-hit districts, Thackeray has sought intervention of the Election Commission to postpone the elections.�I would also write to the poll panel on the issue,� he told reporters. The Opposition has been accusing the state government of inept handling of the flood situation.�The situation there (in Western Maharashtra) is unlikely to be brought under control until October given the large scale devastation. The code of conduct will come into force in September and the government will stop the relief work citing the same. So it is better to postpone the polls to the next year,� Thackeray said.Observing that lakhs of people in Kolhapur and Sangli districts have lost the shelter, the MNS chief has expressed fear of breaking out of an epidemic once the water levels recede.�It will take more time to restore normalcy there,� he said. He accused the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena of being �ruthless� towards the plight of people and �occupied with politics�. Thackeray, who has been backing the Congress and the NCP on various issues against the ruling NDA, also accused the government of not providing adequate assistance to flood victims. The MNS, which has witnessed a huge slide in popularity from once sending 13 MLAs to the Assembly to no representation, has been struggling to stay afloat in the state politics.Apparently referring to the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, Thackeray alleged while the ruling BJP can spend Rs 3,000 crore on constructing a statue but it cannot extend adequate relief to save the lives of the people in Maharashtra. �The Army should have been approached earlier to take charge of the largescale rescue works (in Sangli and Kolhapur). But they (the BJP and Shiv Sena) had no time from their �yatras� (campaigns) and politics to think on this line,� he said.Heavy rains have triggered floods in the rivers flowing in the western Maharashtra region, affecting districts of Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Pune and Solapur. Over four lakh people have been evacuated so far from the flood-hit areas, mostly from Kolhapur and Sangli, apart from Satara, Ratnagiri, Sindgudurg, Raigad, Thane, Nashik and Palghar districts.The death toll due to floods in the districts of Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Pune and Solapur stood at 29 till Friday. Though the flood situation in Kolhapur and Sangli districts showed signs of improvement on Saturday as water started to recede, it would take at least two to three days before water could be discharged completely from these districts, according to officials.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market�s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

6013,YouTube moderators claim it bends rules to favour its stars: Report,"YouTube allegedly favours some popular channels and 'stars' on its platform, enforcing lenient punishments for top video creators whose work ""brings in the most money"" for the company, The Washington Post reported. Moderators claimed YouTube made exceptions for popular creators including PewDiePie, Logan Paul and Steven Crowder. YouTube denied the allegations, asserting it enforces rules equally.",Engadget,"YouTube just can't seem to get out of this hole it has dug itself into. According to a Washington Post report, the video giant has let top video creators get away more lightly with problematic content than those who bring in in fewer videos. The publication spoke with 11 current and former moderators for the platform, who have worked in teams that make decisions around this content, and they expressed that popular accounts ""often get special treatment in the form of looser interpretations of YouTube's guidelines prohibiting demeaning speech, bullying and other forms of graphic content.""According to the Post's sources, YouTube ""made exceptions for popular creators including Logan Paul, Steven Crowder and Pew Die Pie."" The publication reported that YouTube has denied those claims, ""saying it enforces rules equally and tries to draw the line in the right places.""YouTube makes money from ads on high-traffic videos, and shares the revenue with their makers. When a creator breaks a rule, they might have their ads removed from their channels or uploads. Their videos could also get removed entirely. But, according to the Post report, unlike at Facebook and Twitter, YouTube's moderators don't all have the ability to delete content themselves. They have to report to ""higher-ups who make the ultimate decision"" as to whether a video or channel is safe to run ads on.The moderators who spoke to the Post said ""their recommendations to strip advertising from videos that violate the site's rules were frequently overruled by higher-ups within YouTube when the videos involved higher profile content creators who draw more advertising.""They also added that many of the rules are ""ineffective and contradictory"" anyway, characterizing them as ""ad hoc decisions, constantly shifting policies and a widespread perception of arbitrary standards when it came to offensive content.""In response to the Post, a YouTube spokesperson said it has two sets of standards for conduct, with stricter rules for ""creators who can benefit from advertising on their videos because they are effectively in business with YouTube."" Meanwhile, general community guidelines are somewhat looser, and the division of policies for moderators is meant to make their work more specialized and efficient.YouTube has come under fire lately for its apparently inability to limit problematic content on its platform. The company has tried, with efforts like manually reviewing a million videos for violations of its terrorism policy, banning dangerous challenges and pranks as well as tweaking its recommendation algorithms to stop suggesting conspiracy videos and to surface ""quality family content"". In the third quarter of 2018 alone, YouTube removed 58 million videos that violated its policies.But it hasn't been enough. Google's own employees petitioned to ban the company from SF Pride earlier this year due to beliefs that YouTube was not doing enough to protect the LGBTQ community from abusive content. YouTubers in Europe also moved to unionize in an effort to make the company be ""more transparent about its rules and decisions, especially in regard to monetization or demonetization of videos.""YouTube spokesperson Alex Joseph told Engadget that ""Over the last several years we've made significant investments in the people, tools, and technology needed to live up to our responsibility."" These investments include ""machine learning to detect bad content at scale or expanding the teams working to combat violative content to over 10,000 people across Google,"" Joseph added. YouTube also conducts ""a systematic review of our policies to make sure we're drawing the line in the right place.""Joseph stressed that ""We apply these policies consistently, regardless of who a creator is.""Whether the accounts from the 11 moderators in the Post report paint a fair and accurate picture of the goings-on at YouTube or not, there is certainly room to question the video network's practices. It's clearly time for the platform to claim responsibility and be fully transparent about what it has been doing.Update (at 1:54 p.m. ET, August 9th 2019): This article was updated to include a statement YouTube provided to Engadget.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/09/youtube-moderate-big-stars-bias-lenient-punishment/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

As detailed by iFixit, Apple has activated a �dormant software lock� in iOS that blocks features like Battery Health in settings when an iPhone uses a battery that was not installed by Apple itself, 9to5mac reported on Thursday.iFixit calls Apple�s latest step of locking users into its ecosystem a �user-hostile choice�, but the move is not isolated. As iFixit writes, �This service indicator is the equivalent of a �Check Oil� light that only a Ford dealership can reset, even if you change the oil yourself.�If a user tried getting a battery replacement from a third party service, a pop-up would appear on the iPhone that would read, �Unable to verify if this iPhone has a genuine Apple battery.

This upcoming device will be more likely an iPad than a foldable iPhone. This is according to analysts at Swiss investment bank UBS. Currently, Apple is gearing up for a launch event sometime in the beginning of September. Here, it will reportedly launch three iPhones. Of the three upcoming iPhone 11 smartphones, two will replace the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max.

But the wild is a great leveller, it doesn't care who you are. It rewards commitment and courage, you got to work together. We got hit by some really big stones and torrential rain whilst we were there. Our team, who was filming, was really on the edge, but the Prime Minister was just very calm and I saw that throughout our journey. Whatever we were doing, he was very calm. That was cool to see. You never really know what someone is like until there's a crisis. It was good to be reminded that as a world leader, Prime Minister Modi is calm in a crisis,"" he said.Grylls and Modi channelled their adventurous side for the Discovery show, extensively shot in the rainforests of Uttarakhand, as they took an off-track journey across the national park.Home to a large number of tigers, the national park is built over an extent of 520 square kilometres and is among the few tiger reserves in India that allows overnight stays in the lap of the National Park. It also shelters rare species like Otters and the endemic fish eating crocodile, and is one of the most sought after destinations for the wildlife buffs.What stood out the most about Modi throughout the journey, Grylls said, was the global leader's humility, as even through incessant rains, there was a ""big smile"" on his face. ""What shone bright for me was his humility. He was a very humble guy and even though there was pouring rain and his secret services were trying to get out umbrellas, he said 'no I'm fine' and then we reached a river. I made this raft out of reeds and a tarpaulin. I said I think we can get across the river using this, but the secret services were like 'we cannot put the Prime Minister in a little homemade raft'. But he (Modi) said he was fine and we'd do this together. He asked me to get in too, but the things started sinking. So it was me swimming and pushing him, he was soaking wet but there was a big smile on his face even through the rain. You learn about people in those moments,"" said a visibly-elated Grylls.The BAFTA award-winning TV host went on to say that despite having to cross big overflowing rivers in unfavourable weather conditions, the Prime Minister was very considerate and trusting throughout the journey.""I said to him in the beginning, it was my job to keep you safe from wild animals, bad weather and big rivers, which was true. He was very calm and considerate, very trusting of me and we just travelled together. It was harder for his security team as they were carrying weapons briefcases and all that. The Prime Minister in the middle of it was an example of calm and cheerfulness,"" he opined.Grylls also said the episode brings out a side of the Prime Minister like never seen before.Last month, Grylls had shared a 45-second promo of the special episode on Twitter, which broke the internet, as people got to see a completely contrasting side to the Prime Minister.In the snippet of the much-awaited episode, Modi is seen interacting with Grylls, riding a dingy and putting together a spear.""You are the most important man in India. my job is to protect you,"" he said in the video, covering the Prime Minister's shoulder with a jacket.Man Vs Wild With Bear Grylls and Prime Minister Modi will premiere simultaneously on 12 Discovery channels in India on August 12 and will be showcased in as many as 180 countries.

But the wild is a great leveller, it doesn't care who you are. It rewards commitment and courage, you got to work together. We got hit by some really big stones and torrential rain whilst we were there. Our team, who was filming, was really on the edge, but the Prime Minister was just very calm and I saw that throughout our journey. Whatever we were doing, he was very calm. That was cool to see. You never really know what someone is like until there's a crisis. It was good to be reminded that as a world leader, Prime Minister Modi is calm in a crisis,"" he said.Grylls and Modi channelled their adventurous side for the Discovery show, extensively shot in the rainforests of Uttarakhand, as they took an off-track journey across the national park.Home to a large number of tigers, the national park is built over an extent of 520 square kilometres and is among the few tiger reserves in India that allows overnight stays in the lap of the National Park. It also shelters rare species like Otters and the endemic fish eating crocodile, and is one of the most sought after destinations for the wildlife buffs.What stood out the most about Modi throughout the journey, Grylls said, was the global leader's humility, as even through incessant rains, there was a ""big smile"" on his face. ""What shone bright for me was his humility. He was a very humble guy and even though there was pouring rain and his secret services were trying to get out umbrellas, he said 'no I'm fine' and then we reached a river. I made this raft out of reeds and a tarpaulin. I said I think we can get across the river using this, but the secret services were like 'we cannot put the Prime Minister in a little homemade raft'. But he (Modi) said he was fine and we'd do this together. He asked me to get in too, but the things started sinking. So it was me swimming and pushing him, he was soaking wet but there was a big smile on his face even through the rain. You learn about people in those moments,"" said a visibly-elated Grylls.The BAFTA award-winning TV host went on to say that despite having to cross big overflowing rivers in unfavourable weather conditions, the Prime Minister was very considerate and trusting throughout the journey.""I said to him in the beginning, it was my job to keep you safe from wild animals, bad weather and big rivers, which was true. He was very calm and considerate, very trusting of me and we just travelled together. It was harder for his security team as they were carrying weapons briefcases and all that. The Prime Minister in the middle of it was an example of calm and cheerfulness,"" he opined.Grylls also said the episode brings out a side of the Prime Minister like never seen before.Last month, Grylls had shared a 45-second promo of the special episode on Twitter, which broke the internet, as people got to see a completely contrasting side to the Prime Minister.In the snippet of the much-awaited episode, Modi is seen interacting with Grylls, riding a dingy and putting together a spear.""You are the most important man in India. my job is to protect you,"" he said in the video, covering the Prime Minister's shoulder with a jacket.Man Vs Wild With Bear Grylls and Prime Minister Modi will premiere simultaneously on 12 Discovery channels in India on August 12 and will be showcased in as many as 180 countries.

However, I will hold on it (the spear) since you insist!""Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview to ANI, Grylls was asked whether the audience will get to see him and Prime Minister eating any unpalatable food in their survival quests as the show which goes by name Man Vs Wild is known for it.To this Grylls refuted the possibility by saying that the ""Prime Minister is vegetarian"".""Prime Minister is a vegetarian, so there was going to be no eating of grubs or anything like that. But in the wild, you can survive very well off berries, roots, plants and certainly, Prime Minister spent his younger years in the wild, so he was very comfortable with that. We ended up very cold and very wet but shared some beautiful Indian tea together in the end; that was a very special moment for me,"" the adventurer shared.Modi also stressed on important issues like the need to preserve and embrace nature.Responding to Grylls, when he pointed out evident dangers lurking in their vicinity (on account of wild animals), Modi fearlessly said, ""We should not take this place as a danger zone. When we go against nature then everything becomes dangerous; human beings too become dangerous. On the other hand, if we co-operate with nature, then she also co-operates with us.""In a first, Modi will feature in Discovery Channel's show 'Man Vs Wild' alongside Grylls.Shot in Jim Corbett National Park, the special episode will be broadcast on August 12 at 9 pm and will be showcased in 180 countries around the world.Elated about the association, the Prime Minister had earlier said he was both intrigued and inclined to take part in the show.""For years, I have lived among nature, in the mountains and the forests. These years have a lasting impact on my life.

Patrick Crusius also told detectives that he entered the Walmart with an AK-47 and multiple magazines. Crusius has been charged with capital murder and is being held without bond.",Reuters,"EL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - The suspected gunman accused of killing 22 people in a shooting rampage at Walmart in El Paso, Texas last weekend confessed while surrendering and told police he was targeting �Mexicans,� according to an El Paso police affidavit released on Friday .  The suspect, Patrick Crusius, 21, came out of his vehicle, stopped at an intersection, �and stated out loud �I�m the shooter��, Detective Adrian Garcia said in the affidavit on Sunday, a day after the shooting. Crusius has been charged with capital murder and is being held without bond. The affidavit said Crusius waived his right to remain silent after he was taken into custody and told detectives he entered the Walmart with an AK47 and multiple magazines. �The defendant stated his target (was) Mexicans,� the affidavit said. Crusius is accused of shooting and killing 22 people and wounding two dozen more on Saturday, shortly after a manifesto appeared online explaining his motivation and decrying a �Hispanic invasion� of the United States. Most of those listed as dead had Hispanic names. Just hours later, a gunman wearing body armor and a mask opened fire in a crowded neighborhood in Dayton, Ohio, killing nine people, including his own sister.  President Donald Trump visited both communities on Thursday and was met with chanting protesters who accused him of inflaming tensions with anti-immigrant and racially charged rhetoric. Authorities said Crusius drove 11 hours from his hometown of Allen, Tex., near Dallas, to perpetrate a massacre in the predominantly Hispanic city of El Paso. Authorities say the mass shooting is being investigated as a hate crime and act of domestic terrorism. Democratic presidential candidates have accused Trump of fanning racist, white nationalist sentiments with anti-immigrant, racially charged language at rallies and on Twitter. They said he has created political climate conducive to hate-based violence. Trump suggested on Friday he could persuade the powerful National Rifle Association lobby group to drop its strong opposition to gun restrictions after recent mass shootings that have reignited the gun control debate. [L2N2550AB] Nearly half of all Americans believe another mass shooting in the United States is highly likely soon, according to a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll released on Friday. White House officials and big social media companies met on Friday to talk about how to curb extremism online after the shootings but the White House declined to comment on who took part in the closed-door session.

It�s enough to poop every other day,� Bolsonaro told a journalist who asked whether it was possible to preserve the environment while simultaneously growing the economy and feeding the people of the world during a Friday press conference. �That will be better for the whole world,� he added.The Brazilian leader faces international outcry after the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) revealed clear-cutting of the Amazon rainforest had increased 278 percent for the month of July compared to last year. Slamming the numbers as lies, Bolsonaro fired INPE chief Ricardo Galvao last week, replacing him with a military official.Claiming the data were misleadingly framed to satisfy �sensationalist interpretations,� Environment Minister Ricardo Salles accused the INPE of seeking �more donations from foreign NGOs.� While July and June represent especially high peaks, the deforestation rate is up a solid 40 percent for the last 12 months compared to the previous period. Salles, however, claims the government has a �feasible plan� to combat deforestation and promised to show Europeans �what Brazil really is� when he tours the continent next month.Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina likened criticism of the Bolsonaro government�s environmental record to �terrorism� last month after international human rights organizations called out her agency for loosening regulations on pesticides, allowing many that are banned in the EU to be sprayed liberally on Brazilian foodstuffs that are then exported to the EU.If you like this story, share it with a friend!",https://www.rt.com/news/466200-bolsonaro-poop-less-rainforest-critics/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This allowed the researchers to uncover the data on the client side, even for users who had restricted their location data.�The vulnerability meant that Pen Test Partners could discover the locations of 3fun�s users around the globe.

6046,Facebook may club Instagram's Direct messages with Messenger,"Facebook is planning to integrate its Instagram's Direct messages with its own messaging platform Messenger, Bloomberg reported. Instagram's Direct-messaging staff now reports to the Facebook Messenger team, Bloomberg's sources claimed. This will mark the social media giant's first major step towards its plans to integrate Messenger with Instagram and WhatsApp, the report added.",The Financial Express,"Facebook Inc. is taking the first major step in a plan to merge its systems and let users exchange messages among all its different mobile apps � and is chipping away at the independence of Instagram�s direct-messaging product in the process.Engineers are working to rebuild Instagram�s chat feature using Facebook Messenger�s technology, according to people familiar with the matter. That will make it possible for Instagram users to communicate with those using Messenger, something they can�t do now. To make that technically easier, Instagram�s direct-messaging staff now reports to the Facebook Messenger team, said the people. The look of the photo-sharing app�s messaging product, called Instagram Direct, won�t change much, but the underlying technology powering the service will, the people said.Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg decided last year to make it possible for users of Facebook�s properties � Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger � to chat with one another no matter which service they�re using. The move toward �interoperability,� as he calls it, has been described as a massive technical undertaking. It�s also caused tension within the company, as critics argue the separate products thrive in part because they�re not directly associated with Facebook. The world�s largest social network has faced sharp criticism over its privacy and data-sharing practices.A spokeswoman for Instagram, and another for Messenger, declined to comment.Zuckerberg has made the case internally that Instagram and WhatsApp, acquired in 2012 and 2014 respectively, have used Facebook�s resources to grow their independent brands � so now it�s time for them to give back to the parent company, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing internal matters. Zuckerberg has asserted more control over Instagram and WhatsApp in recent years, reining in their autonomy in an effort to keep all the services working more closely. The leaders of Facebook�s four main apps � Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp � all report directly to Zuckerberg as of this March.Facebook recently said it was going to change the external branding of Instagram and WhatsApp to �Instagram from Facebook� and �WhatsApp from Facebook.� Employees of the divisions will also change to Facebook email addresses, instead of being reachable @instagram.com or @whatsapp.com, people familiar with the company said. That move was reported earlier by Business Insider. The Instagram Direct team�s new reporting structure was described last week by The Information.That plan hasn�t gone over well with some key employees of Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger left the company last fall amid frustrations over Zuckerberg�s control. WhatsApp�s founders also exited after clashing with the CEO over plans to put advertising inside WhatsApp, something the founders vehemently opposed.The departures were dramatic, but haven�t changed Facebook�s plan to bring all of its standalone services closer together. The decision to combine messaging services comes at a time when Facebook is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for potential antitrust violations. Some critics, including Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, have said the integration plan will have the effect of making the company harder to break up from a technical standpoint.Zuckerberg argued in March that the move was more about privacy and convenience. The social network also intends to encrypt all of its chat services, meaning messages will remain private and won�t be stored on Facebook�s servers. Right now, only WhatsApp is fully encrypted in this way, but Zuckerberg�s plan is to encrypt Instagram and Messenger messages as well.Get live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market�s Top Gainers, Top Losers & Best Equity Funds.

6054,Trump gives thumbs-up in pic with baby orphaned in attack; criticised,US President Donald Trump has been criticised over a picture wherein he can be seen smiling and giving a thumbs-up while posing with a baby who was orphaned in the mass shooting in Texas. The image was shared by US First Lady Melania Trump who can be seen holding the baby. The picture was taken during Trump's visit to Texas.,Reuters,"(Reuters) - A photo of U.S. President Donald Trump smiling broadly and giving a thumbs-up as his wife, Melania, cradles a baby orphaned in the El Paso, Texas mass shooting has become a social media talking point days after the first lady posted it on Twitter. The image was taken on Wednesday at the University Medical Center of El Paso during Trump�s visit to the West Texas border city to meet with first responders, medical personnel and surviving victims from Saturday�s gun violence at a Walmart store. The president and his wife had traveled earlier in the day to Dayton, Ohio, for a similar hospital condolence call in the wake of a deadly shooting rampage that rocked that city just 13 hours after the bloodshed in El Paso.  The two shootings together claimed 32 lives, including that of the gunman who committed the Dayton massacre. Trump avoided the press during both hospital visits, which were closed to media coverage, but the White House later released a brief video montage of the visits. The first lady also tweeted several photos from the visit, including one that shows her standing in front of a University Medical Center of El Paso backdrop cradling a 2-month-old infant whose parents, Andre and Jordon Anchondo, were both slain in the Walmart attack, reportedly as they shielded him from gunfire. Standing beside the first lady is the smiling president giving a thumbs-up sign. They are flanked by the baby's aunt and an uncle, Tito Anchondo, who is also smiling and has his arm stretched around Trump's shoulders as the four pose together here The optics of the picture struck many on social media as demonstrating a lack of empathy or respect for the gravity of the occasion by the president. ""A baby who was taken from home and forced to serve as a prop here at a photo-op for the very monster whose hate killed her/his parents,"" Democratic strategist Greg Pinelo wrote on Twitter in response to the photo. But Tito Anchondo, who described himself and his slain brother as Trump supporters, told the Washington Post in an interview published on Friday that he felt consoled by the president�s visit and denied that Trump was there �pushing any kind of political agenda.� Anchondo said he chose to take his orphaned nephew, baby Paul, to the hospital to meet the president, and said others were politicizing his family�s tragedy. The infant suffered two broken fingers in the shooting, but had since been discharged by doctors.

6055,N Korea fires missiles despite 'beautiful letter' from Kim to Trump,"Hours after US President Donald Trump said he had received a ""very beautiful letter"" from Kim Jong-un, North Korea fired two missiles off its east coast. Trump said Kim had written in his letter that he was ""not happy"" about the US-South Korean military drills being held this month. Meanwhile, South Korea called it a ""show of force"".",Reuters,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Kim Jong Un told him he was ready to resume talks on North Korea�s nuclear and missile programs and would stop missile testing as soon as U.S.-South Korea military exercises end. Trump and Kim have met twice since their first summit in Singapore last year, but little progress has been on Washington�s aim of getting the North Korean leader to give up his weapons.     �I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un in the not too distant future!� Trump said on Twitter. North Korea fired what appeared to be two short-range missiles on Saturday, South Korea said, in a �show of force� against the exercises. More missile launches are highly probable, as the North Korean military is conducting its own summer drills, South Korea�s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement. The exercises are largely computer-simulated as an alternative to previous large-scale annual drills that were halted to expedite denuclearization talks. In his tweet, Trump said Kim sent him a letter saying �very nicely� that he wanted to meet once the �ridiculous and expensive� U.S.-South Korea exercises were over. Trump added: �It was also a small apology for testing the short range missiles, and that this testing would stop when the exercises end.�  Saturday�s missile launches were the latest in a recent string of tests by North Korea that have raised questions about the future of dialogue.  Keen to tout his North Korea policy as a success ahead of his 2020 reelection bid, Trump has played down the threat, saying they do not violate Kim�s pledge to forego nuclear and long-range tests. North Korea�s state media has yet to confirm the launch, but in a commentary on Saturday it blamed the South for �building up arms against dialogue�. �All the facts prove that the South Korean authorities are hell-bent on arms buildup against their dialogue partner,� the state-run KCNA news agency said. Kim has decried the U.S.-South Korean drills as a rehearsal for war aimed at toppling its leadership. The launches were apparently testing capabilities of a new short-range missile Pyongyang is developing, South Korea�s presidential office said. �Because of concerns that North Korea�s series of launches can raise military tensions on the Korean Peninsula, ministers called for North Korea to stop it,� the Blue House said, citing a meeting of South Korea�s top security officials.      The missiles were fired at dawn from an area around the northeastern city of Hamhung, South Korea�s JCS said. Large solid-fuel rocket engines for North Korea�s ballistic missile program are most likely being produced at a factory complex in Hamhung, monitoring group 38 North said last year. Hamhung also has a testing site for those engines. Kim Dong-yup, a former naval officer who teaches at Seoul�s Kyungnam University, said the weapons could be related to the completion of North Korea�s new rocket artillery system that required multiple launches of the same kind. Japan�s ministry of defense said the projectiles did not pose an immediate security threat.

Washington is lobbying international partners to join a maritime security coalition at a time of heightened tensions with Iran. Tehran earlier on Friday warned against any presence of its arch-foe Israel in the planned coalition. �(The) Persian Gulf is a vital lifeline and thus nat�l security priority for Iran, which has long ensured maritime security,� Zarif said in his tweet.  �Mindful of this reality, any extra-regional presence is by definition (a) source of insecurity ... Iran won�t hesitate to safeguard its security,� Zarif said. Britain said on Monday it was joining the United States in the maritime security mission in the Gulf to protect vessels after Iran seized a British-flagged tanker. Traffic in the Strait, through which about a fifth of the world�s oil passes, has become the focus of a standoff between Iran and the United States after President Donald Trump quit a 2015 nuclear pact and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. Iran says the responsibility of securing these waters lies with Tehran and other countries in the region.

6063,"Kumble hit his 1st int'l ton in 389th game, 17 years after debut","Former India captain Anil Kumble scored his only international hundred in a Test, his 389th international match across formats, against England on August 10, 2007. Kumble, who had made his international debut in April 1990, scored 110*(193) to help India register 664 runs. Notably, Kumble is the oldest Indian (36 years and 296 days) to score a maiden international hundred.",Cricket Country,"On August 10, 2007, Anil Kumble�s superlative career scaled that one peak that had eluded him for 17 years. Arunabha Sengupta remembers the day when India�s greatest match-winning bowler enjoyed perhaps his happiest moment at the batting crease ever � scoring his only century in Tests.One wonders whether the magical figures of 10 for 74 had gladdened his heart nearly as much. One wonders whether the 35 occasions when he claimed five wickets in an innings ever came close this moment of euphoria.For long it had seemed that the champion leg-spinner had not done enough justice to his batting potential. For someone who could compensate his inability to turn his leg-breaks with accuracy astounding enough to bag him 619 wickets, expectations are set staggeringly high.And besides, Anil Kumble could bat � he has 7 hundreds in First-class cricket to vouch for. He got behind the line like a seasoned pro, and could get down on a bent knee to essay scorching covers drives. And punctuated between clumsy defensive prods were square cuts that looked fierce and effective when they came off.That is perhaps why his smile had never been wider than on August 10, 2007, when the ball had crept past Matt Prior, all along the non-striker�s �V� to the boundary, to propel him to 101.So near yet so farNever one to back away from either short pitched stuff or a challenging contest, on numerous occasions he had played valuable knocks � even match winning ones.His second innings 42 against Courtney Walsh and Kenny Benjamin, including some excellent drives on the up, was almost as vital as Sachin Tendulkar�s 85 in the win against West Indies at the Wankhede in 1994.And against South Africa two years later, he had been in immaculate batting form. At Ahmedabad, he had batted adamantly, showing extreme reluctance in giving his wicket away, and had helped debutant VVS Laxman set a target that would win the Test. His best ever innings came at Eden Gardens during the second Test.Against the speed of Allan Donald, Lance Klusener and Brian McMillan, he had looked sterling even beside an effervescent Mohammad Azharuddin in full flow � blasting 13 boundaries in a fantastic rearguard innings of 88. It was the fear of exposing last man Narendra Hirwani, the proverbial rabbit, in front of this predatory attack, that prompted him to attempt a suicidal second run in that innings to be caught short of his ground. And probably he wondered along with many others whether that was as close as he would ever get to a century.Kumble knew that perhaps never again would time and opportunity coincide with the few blessed days when timing the ball seemed as easy as making deliveries kick up from the cracks of a fifth-day wicket.And from the late 90s, his batting abilities seemed to be on the wane. His forays at the wicket grew shorter, but for one or two tenacious displays in the face of collapse. By the middle of the noughties, he seemed destined to go down as a champion bowler who had once been good enough with the bat to come close to a scintillating century.Yet, the fighter proved us wrong. From March 2006, he entered the purple patch � if it can be so termed � with his bat, following which he would score 742 runs at an average of more than 20 in the last 29 Tests of his career � including a hundred and two fifties.A 58 in Mohali set the trend. A few months later, at Kingston, he came in at 91 for 6, and scored 45 while adding 93 with skipper Rahul Dravid, before taking 6 for 78 in the second innings to win the first series in the West Indies in 35 years.The long-awaited dayAnd finally came his moment of batting glory.The series in England had been curious for Indian batting. Everyone in the top order had been among runs, but no one had been able to reach three figures.Up 1-0 and going into the final Test, the visitors looked for a huge score in the first innings at The Oval. Every man put his head down and piled up runs. Dinesh Karthik scored 91, Dravid 55, Sachin Tendulkar 82 and Laxman 51.Kumble entered just before lunch on the second day, with the score reading 417 for six. MS Dhoni, at the other end, was blasting his way to a big score. For a while, the wicketkeeper-batsman�s belligerence relegated the more subdued progress of the tail-ender to the background, but Kumble was quickly on his way, driving Monty Panesar crisply to the cover fence.After lunch he followed it up by cutting Chris Tremlett twice for boundaries behind point and coming down the wicket to Panesar, hitting him inside out through the covers.Meanwhile, Dhoni had gone berserk, launching Panesar for two sixes and then lofting Kevin Pietersen for sixes off successive balls. At 92, he tried for the maximum for the third time in as many balls and holed out at deep square leg.However, Kumble moved smoothly into the role of the aggressor. With Zaheer Khan in no hurry to get out, he kept rushing down the wicket to spinners and angling his bat to pierce the gap between slip and gully against the pacemen. By the time his 50 was up, Kumble was driving through the off side with �lan, even against the faster bowlers.He had progressed to 67 when Zaheer departed. RP Singh essayed a brief cameo, before hitting one back to James Anderson, leaving the older man stranded on 76 with one wicket to go. Sreesanth started with a flourishing square cut for four, and immediately tried a similar stroke off the next ball to be beaten all ends up.Although Sreesanth had shelved his mercurial approach long enough to save the first Test of the series in the company of Dhoni, his methods did not inspire much confidence. It was perhaps a sense of desperation that made Kumble come tearing down the track and launch Panesar over long on.With the senior statesman nearing his much coveted landmark, Sreesanth did put his head down. On that Oval wicket, it was as good as signing a long-term lease.Another inside out drive off Panesar pitch-forked Kumble into his nineties, and as Pietersen came back, a cut through cover took him to 97.And two balls later, the moment of glory arrived in an extraordinary way � a curious mix of the gallant and the gauche that is so much the hallmark of Kumble�s batting. The ball was flighted, Kumble jumped forward to drive, and it came off the bottom edge, streaking past Prior. The frantic batsman, fearing the worst, flung himself face down to get back to the crease, but the ball was already making its merry way behind the keeper, where no fielder ever stands, ending up under the sightscreen.The smile said it all as he raised his bat � and it was reflected without distortion in the faces of his teammates who stood up as one to applaud. Here was a man to whom Indian cricket owed most of its wins, and the country stood up to rejoice to the beat of his happy heart.No one could have grudged this magnificent man his milestone � not the tired Englishmen, not even fellow leg-spinner Shane Warne. At 36 years 297 days, he became the oldest Indian to score a maiden hundred. And by getting it in his 118th Test, he broke the recent mark of 97 set by Chaminda Vaas.But, the ever-persevering competitor, he knew his main job would still be to spin India to victory. He took 3 wickets in the first innings, bowled his heart out to pick up two more in the second.England held out, riding on an unenforced follow on. But, India had secured the rubber, and, after countless triumphant series at the top of the bowling tables, for a change Anil Kumble ended up heading the batting averages.(Arunabha Sengupta is trained from Indian Statistical Institute as a Statistician.

6064,Bowler once didn't bowl to debutant for 19 minutes in Ashes Test,"On August 10, 1909, Australia all-rounder Warwick Armstrong kept England debutant Frank Woolley waiting by bowling trial deliveries to his teammates for 19 minutes during an Ashes Test. The then 22-year-old Woolley had come to bat when England were at 187/4 in the first innings. According to the rules at the time, bowlers were allowed to bowl unlimited trial deliveries.",Cricket Country,"August 10, 1909. As Frank Woolley waited to face his first ball in Test cricket at The Oval, Warwick Armstrong kept bowling trial deliveries for 19 minutes. Arunabha Sengupta relives the tactics that kept the young Kent batsman on tenterhooks leading to his cheap dismissal and prompted a change in the laws.It was an unhappy Australian team, but also one of the very best to reach the shores of England.  They remained caught up in constant bickering with the parent organisation, the recently established Board of Control. They lost the first Test at Edgbaston to some magnificent bowling by Colin Blythe and George Hirst. But, by the time they reached The Oval, they had retained the Ashes and led 2-1 in the series.A team led by Monty Noble with such talent as Warren Bardsley, Charlie Macartney, Warwick Armstrong, Victor Trumper, Syd Gregory, Vernon Ransford, Tibby Cotter and Frank Laver � they could not help but win.Yet, the victories hardly brightened the mood in the side. The presence in the side of the supposed opening batsman Peter McAlister and the �observer� Colonel Justin Foxton, infuriated the Australian cricketers.  They were obviously the not-so-secret agents of Billy McElhone, the future Lord Mayor of Sydney and the supremo of the Board of Control.A photograph of the tour from Frank Laver�s collection is revealing. It was taken in Scotland, on a wide-bodied rowing boat. At the bow, half turned to the camera we can see Peter McAlister. All the others are gathered near the stern. On seeing the picture, Gilbert Jessop had remarked, �Not a happy family.�When the team travelled to Nottingham, McAllister was left behind in London, without being informed of the departure of his colleagues. The largely unwanted man did have his moment in the tour, but it was neither on the cricket ground nor among his teammates. With Les Poidevin he attended the inaugural Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) at Lord�s, discussing the possibilities of a triangular series involving England, Australia and South Africa. But, on the whole, the tour was a bitter experience for him.Armstrong vexes HobbsThe tourists benefitted from some weird selection policies of England � which saw 25 players turn out in the five Tests. The methods, according to Wisden, touched �the confines of lunacy�. Australia won at Lord�s and Leeds and drew at Manchester. However, the continuing peevishness spilled out of their dressing room and manifested itself in the action as well. Soon the Australian was branded as a boorish mercenary for whom �cricket is nothing but a business proposition and he plays it mercilessly with not an atom to give his demeanour, but �take all� as his motto.� The principal culprit was perhaps the huge leg-spinning all-rounder Armstrong.At Lord�s it was Armstrong�s leg-spinners which had done the trick � and he had confused the batsmen and observers by being the first Australian bowler to bowl the googly on English soil. But, his conduct on the field was far from exemplary.At Headingley, his manner had so affected Jack Hobbs, that most gentlemanly of batsmen, that the Surrey professional had thrown his wicket away. Pulling Macartney through mid-wicket, Hobbs had slipped while taking off for a run and his heel had dislodged a bail. The Australians had appealed for hit-wicket and Hobbs had been on the verge of walking away when partner John Tyldesley had asked him to tarry. Umpire William West had given him not out.But, the reaction of the Australians and Armstrong in particular had jarred against the sensibilities of this great batsman. In My Cricket Memories Hobbs later wrote: �The Australians made a rare fuss. They gathered together in the field and confabulated. The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire�s decision. This upset me. I did not know whether I was standing on my head or my heel, with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never attempting to play it, and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.� It was unusual for Hobbs to express such degrees of displeasure.However, in the Oval Test, Armstrong went much further � giving a thorough lesson in extending antics to the limits of the rules without breaking them.The odd selectionThe Oval Test was played in constant good weather, unusual for that summer.England sprang their final selection surprise, opting for the 37-year-old leg-break googly bowler Douglas Carr. The recent success of the South African googly quartet and the exploits of Armstrong had perhaps influenced this strange decision, otherwise the selection defied logic. Carr�s total experience of First-Class cricket consisted of 3 matches, none of them in the championships. Initially he had bowled fast while at Oxford. After that he had played only some club cricket at Kent while working there as a schoolmaster. With time, he had developed his leg-spinners. And after the sensation of the googly had started to make waves in the cricket world, he had started experimenting with back of the hand deliveries.In the summer of 1908, he had taken seven wickets for Free Foresters against Oxford. Although few had seen him bowl, there had been rumours about his phenomenal success at club level. So just before the Australians had arrived in England, he had been recruited as an amateur for Kent.Carr had taken 5 wickets against Oxford on his First-Class debut. He had followed it up with 8 for the Gentlemen against the Players at The Oval, and 6 more in the return match at Lord�s. It was mainly due to the speculations of the press and public that this virtually unknown cricketer suddenly found himself rolling his arm over for England. And the debutant scalped Gregory, Noble and Armstrong with just 55 on the board.With Syd Barnes getting rid of Ransford with a ball that came off the pitch at speed of lightning, it became 58 for 4. Things looked gloomy for Australia, but for a man riding the crest of his supreme confidence.  Before the game, Bardsey had sought out the team scorer William �Fergie� Ferguson, and proclaimed, �Bill, I am going to score two centuries in this match.� And now he proceeded to play a fantastic innings of 136. At the other end Trumper provided solid support, even if not at his flashiest best.The peculiar captaincy of Archie MacLaren also helped Australia�s cause. With the top order reeling to the opening bowlers, he took Barnes off and kept the aging Carr on for more than an hour and a half. By lunch, the visibly tired leg-spinner had lost his zip. Although he finished with five wickets, they were in exchange of as many as 146 runs from 34 overs. Australia totalled 325.The trial ballsWith Hobbs out of action with injury, England opened with Reggie Spooner and MacLaren. Tibby Cotter got rid of both of the openers cheaply, but CB Fry and Wilfred Rhodes added 104 for the third wicket. Rhodes and Jack Sharp put on 47 more before Cotter induced a snick off the Yorkshire all-rounder. It was at 187 for 4 when 22-year-old Frank Woolley walked in to bat for the first time in a Test match.With Frank Laver having hobbled off with a strained thigh, Australians were at a position of slight disadvantage and had no intention of letting up. As the tall, slim left-hander waited with obvious trepidation to face his first ball in Test cricket, Armstrong ambled up and sent down trial balls down the side of the pitch.According to the rules of the day, trial balls were permitted at the beginning of a spell. However, there was no limit to the number that could be bowled. Common sense usually prevailed and these looseners were normally restricted to the minimum. But now as Woolley waited for what seemed to be an eternity, Armstrong showed no inclination of completing his warm-up deliveries.Later EHD Sewell described the incident in sparkling prose: �Believe it or not, but before Woolley squared up to play his first ball, 19 minutes had elapsed. This unofficial interval was brought about almost entirely by Armstrong bowling several trial balls from the pavilion end, somewhat sketchy attempts being made to stop them at the other � the ball in consequence trickling down to the Vauxhall end screen , there to be fielded by urchins and handed over reverently to the bobby on duty, for him to risk his dignity and his helmet to fling back so that we might get on with the match which these �Colonial chaps�  had come so many thousands of miles to play and who did not � appear, after all, to be consumed with fervour to finish.�According to Gideon Haigh, Armstrong took �the quest for psychological advantage over a newcomer to an unexampled extreme. It was 40 years before Stephen Potter�s classic essay in sporting whimsy, The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship, found a name for �the art of winning without actually cheating.��In his King of Games, Woolley himself recalled the period of farce without naming Armstrong: �I remember that, owing chiefly to the bowling of trial balls, over a quarter hour elapsed between the fall of Rhodes� wicket � and the bowling of the first ball to me. It was rather a trying time for me, especially as it was my first Test innings� After the long wait it is perhaps not surprising that �Tibs� Cotter bowled me for eight.�Sewell observed with undisguised sarcasm that Armstrong was �trying to learn how slowly he could make a bowled ball reach the screen.� He went on to add that the marching orders of the Australian team ran: �win � at any price�.The first man to score two centuries in a Test matchThe Australians did win the series. Despite Cotter�s lion-hearted bowling, Sharp�s century did earn England a 27 run lead, but Gregory and Bardsley put on 180 for the first wicket in the second innings.Before Bardsley went out to bat, Ferguson asked him if he would get his second century as promised. The batsman replied, �Certainly.� He scored 130, becoming the first ever cricketer to score two hundreds in a Test.Bardsley was in impeccable form all through the tour. Against Essex, Trumper had to run him out for 219 with the words, �How many more did you want, Curly? Remember there are others in the side who�d like an innings.�In the second innings too Carr was given a long bowl, and the leggie finished with 2 for 136. Strangely, MacLaren had him bowl 69 overs in the match compared to just 46 by Barnes, acknowledge as the best bowler in the world. Noble declared at 339 for 5, leaving England an impossible 313 to win in just over two hours. The match ended in a draw.What followed?� Carr continued to take wickets in the First-Class matches that summer, but his professional commitments rendered him unavailable for the tour of South Africa. He never played another Test.� As a result of Armstrong�s rather questionable tactics, the counties tightened the law around trial balls and MCC followed suit.� Armstrong, however, continued his custom of bowling warm-up deliveries. In a match at Wellington in 1912-13, he repeated the saga of sending down looseners as the new batsman waited. When told by the umpire that it was against the rules, the huge all-rounder nonchalantly asked, �Aw. What�s the penalty?� The umpire however did not back down and informed him that he could have the match replayed.Brief scores:Australia 325 (Warren Bardsley 136, Victor Trumper 73, Charlie Macartney 50; Douglas Carr 5 for 146) and 339 for 5 decl. (Syd Gregory 74, Warren Bardsley 130, Monty Noble 55) drew with England 352 (Wilfred Rhodes 66, CB Fry 62, Jack Sharp 105, Kenneth Hutchings 59; Tibby Cotter 6 for 95) and 104 for 3 (Wilfred Rhodes 54).(Arunabha Sengupta is a cricket historian and Chief Cricket Writer at CricketCountry.

He has been a match-winner and a game-changer for South Africa. Great advantage South Africa had has they had a wicket-taking bowler in the form of Steyn.

Asked about South African pacer�s aggression Dravid said that the aggression he brings to the Proteas� side is something different. When you play against someone like Dale Steyn, you should be up for the contest. At some point in time in his career, he was as quick as anyone I have ever played.While talking about Steyn�s strengths, Dravid said that Steyn�s real strength is pace, swing and the length he bowls at. Other than probably not having the in-swinging capability, he bagged all skill set in his kit a pacer needs to have. �He is the Malcolm Marshall of our generation. Steyn tried to bowl his best when he was aggressive.

The agency is making arrangements for surgery, which could be in or after September, with details to be announced later, he added. Michiko, 84, will rest this month to conserve her strength. No irregularities were found at a previous breast examination about six months to a year ago during a regular series of check-ups, the spokesman said.  Former Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko stepped down in April after three decades in their roles. Akihito, 85, who has had treatment for prostate cancer and heart surgery, handed over to his son, Naruhito.

6092,Batsman once hit 50 runs in 9 minutes to reach ton in 37 min,"Ex-England cricketer Chris Old smashed 50 runs in nine minutes to complete his hundred off 72 balls in 37 minutes against Warwickshire in a first-class match on August 9, 1977. Old's first fifty came off 51 balls in 28 minutes, including eight fours and a six. His next fifty took him 21 balls, including four fours and five sixes.",Cricket Country,"Chris Old went on a rampage at Edgbaston on August 9, 1977, plundering runs to bring up a 72-ball 100 including a 9-minute 50. Abhishek Mukherjee looks at the one of the most outrageous batting performances in the history of the sport.Names can be misleading. While the Yorkshire line-up for the 1977 Championship match at Edgbaston consisted of �non-violent� surnames like Bore, Old, Love, and Boycott in their line-up (okay, they had Sharp, and perhaps a somewhat aggressive one in Leadbeater), Warwickshire boasted of aggressive ones like Rouse, Savage, and Humpage.Yet, it was a Yorkshireman who pulled off one of the most violent innings of all time on August 9, 1977.As per the rules the first innings of each side was restricted to 100 overs; Rohan Kanhai won the toss and with Bob Willis in his pantheon, put Yorkshire in under overcast conditions. The tourists ended the rain-interrupted Day One on 124 for 2 with Geoff Boycott and Jim Love having added 78 for the third wicket.The duo accelerated the after the rest day, and after Boycott�s departure for 104 (it was his 99th First-Class hundred), Love went on to score 129, and thanks to some lusty blows from Kevin Sharp and David Bairstow they reached 353 for 5 in their stipulated 100 overs. Warwickshire finished the day at 38 for 1.Dennis Amiss began fluently the next morning, and after he and John Whitehouse departed the West Indians � Alvin Kallicharran and Kanhai himself� added 65 in no time; soon after lunch Kanhai declared the innings closed 149 runs behind,  just avoiding the follow-on, possibly in an effort to try and go for a nearly impossible outright win.Boycott did not open batting. There was a reason for this: he was stuck on 99 First-Class hundreds, and with The Ashes Test to start at Headingley on August 11 (two days after the County match got over), he was keen on registering his 100th 100 in front of his home crowd in an Ashes Test.Barrie Leadbeater and Richard Lumb gave Yorkshire a decent start, but once Eddie Hemmings dismissed both and Whitehouse�s innocuous off-breaks accounted for Sharp, the score suddenly looked 40 for 3; there was obviously no question of trouble with the match having reached its final stages, but Yorkshire obviously wanted to finish the match on a positive note. Boycott, having held himself back till now, decided to do so for a bit longer and sent in Chris Old.Old entersOld had declared himself unfit for the fourth Ashes Test at his home ground in Headingley, scheduled to start on August 11. In the inaugural World Cup match two years back he was promoted by Mike Denness to six, and had taken the Indian attack to the cleaners by scoring a 30-ball 51. Even more recently his 23-ball 25 had helped England beat Australia by one wicket at Old Trafford, and that was just two months back.Old wasn�t quite fully fit; he did not bat in the first innings, and had bowled only 13 overs, going wicketless. When he came out to bat he decided to give it the full blast.Kanhai kept Whitehouse on � perhaps because he had picked up a wicket, or perhaps under the hope that Yorkshire may want to go for a declaration and give them a chance to chase it. In their co-authored book 500-1: The Miracle of Headingley �81, Rob Steen and Alastair McLellan have mentioned that the innings had come against �Warwickshire�s generous declaration bowlers�.Old�s first fifty came in quick time � in 51 balls. He had struck 8 fours and a six then and had batted for 28 minutes. With Yorkshire past hundred, Kanhai had realised that the cause was futile, and took Hemmings off after a while and decided to give himself a chance.As Kanhai came on to bowl his military-medium, Old exploded. Seldom has Edgbaston witnessed ruthless butchery. So fast did Old score runs that the fact that he passed 5,000 First-Class runs at 75 went unnoticed, and the left-hander brought up his hundred in 72 balls and in 37 minutes. The second fifty came up in 9 minutes.Pause for a moment here to allow the last line to sink in: a fifty in nine minutes of batting. This was in an era when limited-overs cricket was a new concept, and T20 cricket was decades away from being conceived. The second fifty had taken him 21 balls, and 46 of that (4 fours, 5 sixes) had come in boundaries.One wonders what had been going on in Love�s mind at the other end: he was, after all, the top-scorer in the match; he had tamed Willis in the first innings; he was supposed to be the one to take control over here; and now, he was reduced to a complete spectator thanks to the adventures of a bowler who had declared himself unfit.In the process Old went past Gilbert Jessop�s record (40 minutes, for Gloucestershire against Yorkshire at Harrogate) and sat smugly behind Percy Fender (35 minutes, for Surrey against Northamptonshire at Northampton) in the list of fastest centuries.The Glasgow Herald, while admitting to the fact that the innings had come mostly against occasional bowlers, was all in praise: �Nothing should diminish Old�s achievement in terms of his powerful striking of the ball, but for his full time in the middle the bowling from one end came from Whitehouse, who is not a member of Warwickshire�s bowlers.�Boycott did not close the innings, and he could hardly be blamed: it was, after all, a delay by 9 minutes, and seldom has cricket seen something of this order. Once Old fell for a 42-minute 107 (13 fours, 7 sixes) he probably realised that there was a declaration on the cards and set Warwickshire an impossible 337 in 25 minutes and 20 overs.Warwickshire responded to the farce by sending out Hemmings to open. Old, warmed up by his batting, removed Hemmings, and Boycott, opening bowling at the other end, removed Ray Savage. The hosts played out time after some aggressive batting from Humpage, who remained unbeaten on 52 out of 74 for 2.What followed� Old won the Walter Lawrence Trophy for having scored the fastest century of the season. His (and Fender�s) records have been surpassed by Glen Chapple (21 minutes), Tom Moody (26 minutes), and Steve O�Shaughnessy (35 minutes), but they were mostly by-products of deliberate poor bowling to enhance quick declarations.� Everything went according to script for Boycott: he reached his 100 on Day One at Headingley before departing for 191 on Day Two. To make the script perfect, England regained The Ashes as Mike Hendrick bowled them to an innings victory with 5 for 41 and 4 for 54.� After captaining Yorkshire in 1981 and 1982 Old made a shift in 1984 to � of all places � Warwickshire.� In addition to picking up 1,070 wickets at 23.48 at First-Class level Old also ended up scoring 7,756 runs at 20.84 with 6 hundreds.Brief scores:Yorkshire 353 for 5 (Jim Love 129, Geoff Boycott 104, Kevin Sharp 48) and 188 for 4 decl. (Chris Old 107, Jim Love 40*) drew with Warwickshire 204 for 3 decl. (John Whitehouse 73*, Dennis Amiss 49) and 74 for 1 (Geoff Humpage 52*).(Abhishek Mukherjee is a cricket historian and Senior Cricket Writer at CricketCountry.

Now with this report there is recognition that how we have safeguarded our forests and lands benefit the entire world, but our rights to exist and manage these lands need to be strengthened. Will the world listen?""While the IPCC report emphasizes the global need to increase food production, forests are often cleared to produce agricultural commodities that do not address food security needs, such as beef, palm oil, and soybeans.In their response statement, indigenous peoples and local communities worldwide discuss the false choice offered between managing intact landscapes to keep carbon out of the atmosphere and clearing landscapes for economic development projects that include agro-industrial plantations.The statement added: ""Where our rights are respected, by contrast, we provide an alternative to economic models that require tradeoffs between the environment and development. Our traditional knowledge and holistic view of nature enables us to feed the world, protect our forests, and maintain global biodiversity.""",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/aug/09/united-nations%E2%80%8B-report-stresses-land-rights-for-indigenous-peoples-2016415.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6118,Researchers demo way to fool Apple's Face ID for unconscious users,"Tencent Security researchers at the 2019 Black Hat USA conference in Las Vegas demonstrated a way to trick Apple's Face ID for unconscious people using modified glasses. They stuck black and white tape to reproduce an eye's look. ""If you're wearing glasses, [Face ID] won't extract 3D information from the eye area when it recognises the glasses,"" researchers said.",BGR,"With the iPhone X, Apple ditched the fingerprint scanner (Touch ID) and replaced it with Face ID. Apple has always billed Face ID to be more secure than Touch ID. And while bypassing the biometric security isn�t easy, it is possible. Security researchers at 2019 Black Hat conference revealed a possible flaw with facial biometrics.According to researchers, once can use modified glasses to bypass the biometric security medium. �By merely placing tape carefully over the lenses of a pair of glasses and placing on the victim�s face the researchers demonstrated how they could bypass Apple�s FaceID in a specific scenario. The attack itself is difficult, given the bad actor would need to figure out how to put the glasses on an unconscious victim without waking them up,� a report on Threatpost said.Researchers took advantage of �liveness� feature of the system. It detects if a person is looking at the device. �They discovered that the abstraction of the eye for liveness detection renders a black area (the eye) with a white point on it (the iris). And, they discovered that if a user is wearing glasses, the way that liveness detection scans the eye changes.�They then demonstrated the same by creating modified glasses by using white and black tape. In the demo, researchers showed how to bypass security and transfer money using mobile payments. Apple, in a support document explains that Face ID was designed to avoid spoofing by masks and other techniques. To achieve this, it uses neural networks. As an extra layer of security, Apple also has an attention-aware feature.While researchers have found a way to bypass facial biometrics, the exploit is very difficult to pull off. In terms of mitigation, researchers suggest manufacturers to add identity authentication for native cameras. They also recommend to increase �the weight of video and audio synthesis detection.�9539010990089900",https://www.bgr.in/news/apples-face-id-can-be-easily-bypassed-using-modified-glasses-security-researchers/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6119,Huawei reveals Harmony OS as potential alternative to Android,"Huawei unveiled its own operating system Harmony OS at its Developer Conference in Dongguan, China. The Chinese smartphone maker asserted that the software is ready to be deployed ""at any time"" if it loses access to Google's Android OS. Google, which was barred from directly carrying out business with Huawei by the US, has temporarily been relieved to do so.",Engadget,"Huawei's long-rumored Android alternative, Hongmeng, is finally official. At today's Huawei Developer Conference, the company's Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu surprised the audience by unveiling ""HarmonyOS,"" which he says is faster and safer than Android. That said, the software is primarily aimed at IoT products (such as smart displays, wearables, smart speakers and in-car devices) instead of smartphones. Yu says that when Huawei can no longer access Google's Android ecosystem, the company can deploy HarmonyOS ""at any time."" Until then, Huawei will continue to support Android.Yu's presentation was rather technical but in a nutshell, HarmonyOS is positioned as a future-proof, ""microkernel-based, distributed OS for all scenarios."" The platform is open source, and it's actually more of a competitor to Google's upcoming Fuchsia, given that both are microkernel-based and can be used on multiple types of devices at once. In his on-stage presentation he said that Android isn't as efficient due to its redundant codes, outdated scheduling mechanism and general fragmentation issues. Shots fired.With a microkernel design, HarmonyOS should be safer from the get-go as there is no root access available; the microkernel is protected by isolation from external kernel services. The system also applies formal verification -- a set of mathematical approaches used in security-critical fields -- to reliably spot vulnerabilities, whereas traditional methods are likely to miss some.In addition to being a lightweight system, Huawei says HarmonyOS will offer some performance boosts. For one, it'll feature a ""Deterministic Latency Engine"" that can better allocate system resources using real-time analysis and forecasting. Android, on the other hand, is stuck with the Linux kernel's less-intelligent fair scheduling mechanism. HarmonyOS also allows for very fast ""Inter Process Communication"" -- the link between its microkernel and external kernel services like file systems, networks, drivers, apps and more. Huawei claims that HarmonyOS' IPC performance is five times that of Google's Fuchsia, and three times that of QNX.According to Yu, HarmonyOS has been in the works since 2017, and the version Huawei unveiled today will initially target smart display products, such as the Huawei Vision due later this year. While this release still packs a Linux kernel and Huawei's earlier LiteOS kernel alongside its own microkernel, version 2.0, which is expected sometime in 2020, will feature just a HarmonyOS microkernel, thus making it a true HarmonyOS. It'll also support high-performance graphics then, to the point where the company hopes it will be powering ""innovative PCs"" along with wearables, in-car head units, speakers and VR glasses.It's clear that Huawei has intentionally avoided mentioning ""smartphones"" in its slides and press materials today, likely to avoid upsetting its partners over at Google, but Yu wasn't afraid to admit that there may come a time when his company can no longer support the Android ecosystem. Regardless, developers will be able to port their Android apps over to HarmonyOS using Huawei's ARK compiler.While the exec claimed that HarmonyOS is ready to go ""at any time,"" it's hard to tell whether all its supposed advantages will win over developers and users -- especially those in the US. We've seen Samsung's attempt to overthrow Android back in the days using Tizen, but nowadays it's nothing more than the software powering its Galaxy wearables. Windows 10 Mobile is obviously another prime example, despite its emphasis on productivity and security.And then, of course, Huawei still has a trust issue in the west. Despite strong financial performance recently, the company is cautious of its future due to continued pressure from the US government and its allies. In a way, Huawei is facing a tougher challenge than previous failed mobile OS attempts, and it may have to do more than building its own ecosystem.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/09/huawei-harmony-os-hongmeng-android/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Using two-minute videos of 1,328 Canadian and Chinese people, researchers claimed they were able to measure three types of blood pressure with 95-96% accuracy.",Engadget,"In the near future, you might not have to traipse to your doctor or pharmacy to determine your blood pressure. Researchers have figured out a way to accurately measure it with your phone's camera.A selfie video might be all you need to find out your blood pressure, per a study by researchers in Canada and China. University of Toronto developmental psychologist Kang Lee and his postdoctoral researcher Paul Zheng developed a technology called transdermal optical imaging (TOI).It works by taking into account the fact our facial skin is translucent. Optical sensors on smartphones can capture red light reflected from hemoglobin under our skin, which allows TOI to visualize and measure changes in blood flow.The researchers used the tech to analyze two-minute selfie videos of 1,328 adults that were captured with an iPhone camera. Compared with standard methods of determining blood pressure, they were able to measure three types of blood pressure with around 95 percent accuracy. TOI can also analyze faces in pre-recorded videos.Lee co-founded Nuralogix, a startup that released an app called Anura. When you record a 30-second video selfie, the app provides you with resting heart rate and stress level measurements. Nuralogix plans to release another version of the app in China this fall that adds blood pressure measurements to the mix.On the privacy front, Lee says the app uploads results of the analysis to the cloud, but not people's video selfies. Nuralogix plans to offer access to more detailed health data for a monthly fee. The team eventually hopes to track other health attributes with the tech, including blood glucose levels, hemoglobin and cholesterol.However, the tech needs extra research to make it more accurate, Lee said. The vast majority of study participants were of East Asian or European descent, and it didn't include people with very dark or fair skin. Considering Latinx and African-American folks in the US are at above-average risk of hypertension, TOI may not yet be accurate enough for the people who'd perhaps benefit most from it. Expanding the diversity of research participants will improve the tech's accuracy, while finding people with very high or low blood pressure who don't medicate for it has proven a challenge too.The technology could help people at risk of hypertension- or hypotension-related issues to track their blood pressure without the need for a dedicated device. It could also help people with limited healthcare access, such as folks who live in remote areas. ""If you set up a computer or your phone, you can get a doctor who is, let's say, in Toronto and then you can talk to each other and diagnose simultaneously,"" Lee said.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/07/blood-pressure-selfie-video-smartphone-research/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Current India coach Ravi Shastri�s contract ended after the World Cup but he and the support staff have been given a 45-day extension for the ongoing West Indies tour.The BCCI is slated to review the applications from August 13. As per the BCCI�s new constitution, the post will be picked by the Cricket Advisory Committee, comprising World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev, former head coach Anshuman Gaekwad and ex-women�s team captain Shantha Rangaswamy, while the national selection panel will conduct the interviews of the support staff applicants.Among those linked to the India head coach�s role are Tom Moody, Lalchand Rajput and Robin Singh.The PCB on Wednesday removed Arthur and his support staff from their roles, a result of Pakistan failing to qualify for the semi-finals of the World Cup.

6255,Russia's Yandex.Taxi to use face recognition to spot sleepy drivers,"Russian ride-hailing giant 'Yandex.Taxi', co-owned by Uber, is adding facial recognition technology to identify sleepy or drowsy drivers, Bloomberg revealed. A device mounted to the windshield will identify signs of an exhausted person, including blinking, yawning and improper posture. The move comes in response to Russian legislators demanding taxi companies do more to prevent accidents.",Engadget,"Exhausted Russian taxi drivers may soon be forced to take breaks. Yandex.Taxi, the largest taxi service in the nation, will install devices in all their cars that use facial recognition technology to identify tired drivers, reports Bloomberg. The company merged with Uber last year, allowing drivers to access riders from both apps.The device, which will be mounted on the car's windshield, includes software that can identify the signs of an exhausted person -- including blinking, yawning and a less than upright posture. In total, the software can identify 68 facial points.The move by Yandex is in response to demands from Russian legislators that taxi companies do more to prevent accidents. Moscow faced 764 car accidents last year, which resulted in 23 deaths. Many blamed the increased use of ride-hailing services and more cars on the road for the increase in roadside collisions.Automakers have already rolled out similar facial recognition features in their vehicles. The 2019 Subaru Forester includes a feature called DriverFocus, a driver monitoring system that can identify signs of fatigue in drivers. A driver-facing camera on the Cadillac CT6 sedan uses infrared light to track head position.Uber has a more low-tech approach to keep tired drivers off the road -- it automatically goes offline for six hours after drivers reach the 12-hour time limit. Lyft has a 14-hour time limit. But drivers can easily bypass such restrictions if they use both apps. Yandex has already piloted face recognition for drivers in 100 cars, and plans to roll out the technology to several thousand cars soon.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/08/facial-recognition-will-catch-sleepy-taxi-drivers-in-russia/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

6273,China was killing us with unfair trade deals: US Prez Trump,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed China was ""killing"" the country with ""unfair trade deals"". He said, ""Ultimately, [US market] is going to go much higher than it ever would've gone because China was like an anchor on us."" The US stock market had suffered losses after Trump announced a 10% tariff on additional $300 billion of Chinese imports.",Reuters,"By Nandita Bose and Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said his tough stance on China�s economic and trade policies would ultimately benefit the American economy, even as Beijing signalled it could strike back by curbing sales of chemicals known as rare earths that are used in everything from iPhones to military equipment.   The U.S.-China trade war escalated sharply in recent days after Washington on Monday branded Beijing a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994, and said it would impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports, starting on Sept. 1. The moves have jolted financial markets and fuelled concerns about a global recession. U.S. Treasury yields slumped on Wednesday, with 30-year yields nearing record lows, on growing fears of a global downturn and bets the Federal Reserve would have to cut interest rates further to counter growing recession risks. Trump told reporters at the White House that the market reaction had been anticipated, but he remained confident in the strength of the U.S. economy. �Ultimately, it�s going to go much higher than it ever would have gone, because China was like an anchor on us. China was killing us with unfair trade deals,� he said. White House officials say they still expect Chinese negotiators to come to Washington in September for talks, and that the latest tariffs could still be averted if the world�s two largest economies make progress on a trade agreement. But hopes for a deal are dimming and domestic pressure is growing for Trump to cut a deal with Beijing. Goldman Sachs on Tuesday said it no longer expects the United States and China to reach agreement before the November 2020 presidential election given the �harder line� being pursued by both sides. Gary Locke, who served as U.S. ambassador to China from 2011 to 2014, said it was in Washington�s own interest to dial back tensions and work toward some kind of modest deal with Beijing. �The Federal Reserve and others have estimated the tariffs already in place will cost the average American household a $1,000 increase in prices,� he said. �And increased prices will make U.S. companies less competitive here and abroad.�  Fred Bergsten, a former senior U.S. Treasury official, said bearish financial markets and weakening U.S. economic indicators could prompt Trump to delay the Sept. 1 tariffs. �The economy is a big part of his reelection strategy, so he has to hesitate before he does things that could weaken it,� Bergsten, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Reuters.  �If even he is acknowledging that it�s only �ultimately� that we gain, then I think there�s a chance that he�ll dial it back.�  U.S. businesses and consumers paid $6 billion in tariffs in June, a 74 percent rise from the same period a year ago, a coalition of U.S. trade groups said Wednesday, warning a new round of tariffs would exacerbate job losses and dent demand. Jo-Ann Stores, an Ohio-based arts and craft retailer, said tariffs introduced in September 2018 were already cutting into profit margins and raising the risk of layoffs.  �It�s an enormous financial burden,� said Wade Miquelon, CEO of Jo-Ann Stores, who previously served as chief financial officer of Walgreens (WBA.O).  Financial markets have calmed somewhat amid signs that China would not allow the yuan to weaken much further after letting it slip below 7 per dollar for the first time in over a decade. But China still has some levers left to pull.  The Chinese rare earths association on Wednesday said it would support countermeasures in the escalating trade dispute with the United States and accused Washington of using �trade bullying behaviour� to suppress China�s development. The Association of China Rare Earth Industry issued a statement after a special working meeting on Monday to discuss the �guidance� given by Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to a rare earth plant in Jiangxi in May. Xi�s visit stoked fears China would use its dominance over production of rare earths, a group of 17 chemical elements prized for their use in consumer electronics and military equipment, in the escalating trade war, although no restrictions on supplies have so far been announced. Tensions could spike further after the release of an interim U.S. rule for a ban on federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], the world�s largest telecommunications network gear maker. The ban was part of a defence law passed last year and is part of a broad U.S. push against Huawei, the world�s largest telecommunications network gear maker. Washington has accused the company of espionage and stealing intellectual property. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services. It has sued the U.S. government over the restrictions in the defence law. Trump had assured Xi that some of restrictions on Huawei would be relaxed, but U.S. companies have complained that they have received few answers about the situation so far. The U.S. government has urged its allies not to use Huawei equipment, which it says China could exploit for spying. The response from allies has been mixed.

Trade relations between India and Pakistan were already strained following the Pulwama terror attack as India imposed 200 per cent customs duty on all goods imported from the neighbouring nation.Imports from Pakistan declined by 92 percent to 2.84 million dollars in March this year compared to 34.61 million dollars in March 2018, according to the commerce ministry data. India imported goods such as cotton, fresh fruits, cement, petroleum products and mineral ore from Pakistan.During January-March period of 2018-19 fiscal, imports from Pakistan declined by 47 percent to 53.65 million dollars.India's exports to Pakistan too have dipped by about 32 percent to USD 171.34 million in March. However, exports had increased by 7.4 per cent to USD 2 billion during 2018-19.The main products being exported by India include organic chemicals; cotton; nuclear reactors, boilers; plastic products; tanning or dyeing extracts; cereals; sugar; coffee, tea; articles of iron and steel; copper and footwear.India had also revoked the MFN (most favoured nation) status to Pakistan in the aftermath of the terror attack. The country has repealed a security exception clause of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to withdraw this status. Both the countries are member of this body.India can also restrict trade of certain goods and impose port-related restrictions on Pakistani goods.India had granted the MFN status to Pakistan way back in 1996, but the neighbouring country had not reciprocated.Under the MFN pact, a WTO member country is obliged to treat the other trading nation in a non-discriminatory manner, especially with regard to customs duty and other levies.(This story was auto-published from a syndicated feed.

6278,"Instagram ad partner tracked millions of users' location, stories","A marketing partner for Facebook and Instagram, Hyp3r, secretly collected and stored location data and stories of millions of public users, Business Insider reported. Facebook confirmed Hyp3r's actions violated its policies and removed them from the platform. ""We've also made a product change that should help prevent other companies from scraping public location pages in this way,"" it added.",TechCrunch,"Hyp3r, an apparently trusted marketing partner of Facebook  and Instagram, has been secretly collecting and storing location and other data on millions of users, against the policies of the social networks, Business Insider reported today. It�s hard to see how it could do this for years without intervention by the platforms except if the latter were either ignorant or complicit.After BI informed Instagram,  the company confirmed that Hyp3r (styled HYP3R)  had violated its policies and has now been removed from the platform. In a statement to TechCrunch, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed the report, saying:HYP3R�s actions were not sanctioned and violate our policies. As a result, we�ve removed them from our platform. We�ve also made a product change that should help prevent other companies from scraping public location pages in this way.The company started several years ago as a platform via which advertisers could target users attending a given event, like a baseball game or concert. It used Instagram�s official API to hoover up data originally, the kind of data-gathering that has been happening for years by unsavory firms in tech, most infamously Cambridge Analytica.The idea of getting an ad because you�re at a ball game isn�t so scary, but if the company maintains a persistent record not just of your exact locations, but objects in your photos and types of places you visit, in order to combine that with other demographics and build a detailed shadow profile� well, that�s a little scary. And so Hyp3r�s business model evolved.Mark Zuckerberg discovers privacyUnfortunately, the API was severely restricted in early 2018, limiting Hyp3r�s access to location and user data. Although there were unconfirmed reports that this led to layoffs at the company around the time, the company seems to have survived (and raised millions shortly afterwards) not by adapting its business model, but by sneaking around the apparently quite minimal barriers Instagram put in place to prevent location data from being scraped.Some of this was done by taking advantage of Instagram�s Location pages, which would serve up public accounts visiting them to anyone who asked, logged in or not. (This was one of the features turned off today by Instagram.)According to BI�s report, Hyp3r built tools to circumvent limitations on both location collection and saving of personal accounts� stories � content meant to disappear after 24 hours. If a user posted anything at one of thousands of locations and regions monitored by Hyp3r, their data would be sucked up and added to their shadow profile.To be clear, it only collected information from public stories and accounts. Naturally these people opted out of a certain amount of privacy by choosing a public account, but as the Cambridge Analytica case and others have shown, no one expects or should have to expect that their data is being secretly and systematically assembled into a personal profile by a company they�ve never heard of.Facebook settles with FTC: $5 billion and new privacy guaranteesFacebook and Instagram, however, had definitely heard of Hyp3r. In fact, Hyp3r could until today be found in the official Facebook Marketing Partners directory, a curated list of companies it recommends for various tasks and services that advertisers might need.And Hyp3r has been quite clear about what it is doing, though not about the methods by which it is doing it. It wasn�t a secret that the company was building profiles based around tracking locations and brands � that was presumably what Facebook listed it for. It was only when this report surfaced that Hyp3r had its Facebook Marketing Partner privileges rescinded.For its part Hyp3r claims to be �compliant with consumer privacy regulations and social network Terms of Services,� and emphasized in a statement that it only accessed public data.It�s unclear how Hyp3r could exist as a privileged member of Facebook�s stable of recommended companies and simultaneously be in such blatant violation of its policies. If these partners receive even cursory reviews of their products and methods, wouldn�t it have been obvious to any informed auditor that there was no legitimate source for the location and other data that Hyp3r was collecting? Wouldn�t it have been obvious that it was engaging in Automated Data Collection, which is specifically prohibited without Facebook�s permission?I�ve asked Facebook for more detail on how and when its Marketing Partners are reviewed, and how this seemingly fundamental violation of the prohibition against automated data collection could have gone undetected for so long.

6282,$108bn Vision Fund 2 could start investing from Sept: SoftBank CEO,"SoftBank Group's Founder and CEO Masayoshi Son has said the Japanese conglomerate's second, $108 billion Vision Fund could start investing as soon as next month. The second fund has received backing from Microsoft, Apple and Kazakhstan, among others, with $38 billion coming from SoftBank itself. The first fund's $66.3 billion investment in 81 entities is now reportedly worth $82.2 billion.",Reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp�s (9984.T) second Vision Fund could start investing as soon as next month, founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said, as the technology conglomerate reported a leap in profits at its first $100 billion fund.  SoftBank said last week it had secured $108 billion in pledges for its Vision Fund 2 (VF2) from participants including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), without breaking out their individual contributions. The anchor investors from the first fund, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, are showing �high interest� in taking stakes and negotiations are ongoing, Son said on Wednesday after SoftBank turned in first-quarter operating earnings that blew past consensus estimates. That result was aided by a stellar performance at the first Vision Fund, whose operating profit jumped 66% on year to 397.6 billion yen ($3.74 billion) for the three months ended June.  SoftBank is relying on proceeds from the first Vision Fund (VF1) along with other assets to bankroll its $38 billion contribution to the second fund. �Vision Fund 2 could start investing pretty soon, next month or the month after,� Son said.  With the first fund having spent much of its capital on fast growing, late-stage startups like Uber (UBER.N) and WeWork parent The We Company, SoftBank is now turning its attention to the second fund to maintain its oversized industry presence. �Many Japanese companies are sailing using an old map. Using our new map we are looking for a new continent,� Son said.  The first fund�s $66.3 billion investment in 81 firms is now worth $82.2 billion, as the value of its bets in firms like hotel chain OYO, workplace messaging app Slack (WORK.N) and delivery service Doordash has grown. But much of the fund�s gains are paper profits, with its unrealized gains in the first quarter at 604 billion yen.  That was, however, offset by 195 billion yen in unrealized losses from a drop in value of its stake in firms like ride-hailing firm Uber, which is trading below its IPO price. SoftBank�s results have been increasingly volatile as Son shifts focus from the predictable income of telecoms in favor of bets on startups with shifting valuations. The group raked in a quarterly operating profit of 688.8 billion yen, outstripping a 336 billion yen estimate from five analysts compiled by Refinitiv.  The number was, however, down 3.7% from a year ago when results were propped up by a stake sale in chip designer Arm�s China business. SoftBank�s shares, which have rise 42% this year, closed down 0.2% ahead of the earnings.

Enterococcous faecalis (E. faecalis) is one of the most common species. These bacteria also live in the mouth and vagina. They are very resilient, so they can survive in hot, salty or acidic environments.Doctors said that if it spreads to other areas of the body, it may cause life-threatening infections.�Other people in the hospital who have underlying health conditions are at a higher risk of developing the infection.People in hospital settings are particularly vulnerable to E. faecalis infection because hospitalised patients tend to have reduced immunity.�The common use of intravascular and urinary catheter devices can also contribute to the spread of infection as these instruments frequently harbour the E. faecalis bacteria.�The girl was airlifted to AIIMS on August 5 on the instructions of the Supreme Court.",https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/unnao-rape-survivor-battles-severe-blood-infection/465601?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The listings, which were live as recently as two days back, are escaping algorithms designed to catch them, the report said. This comes days after the US witnessed mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso.",Engadget,"Sales listings for shotgun rounds, magazines and other firearm accessories are slipping through the cracks at Google and Amazon -- despite algorithms designed to catch the forbidden items. The Washington Post reported today that listings for such items were live as recently as Tuesday, only days after the nation grappled with mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso. Both tech giants have policies that ban the sale of guns, gun parts and related products like silencers or conversion kits on their online shopping platforms. They also use software designed to identify keywords and images related to firearms.After being alerted of the Post's reporting, representatives for Amazon and Google have claimed that the items in question are no longer on the site. Still, the fight to remove such listings appears to be a game of whack-a-mole for tech giants.A quick search by Engadget of ""gun magazine"" today on Google Shopping unearthed a kit that adjusts the height of a rife magazine and pistol magazine. Both appeared to violate Google's ban, which extends to ""any part that is essential to, or enhances the functionality of a gun"" as well as items that appear to be guns. After Engadget contacted Google, the items were removed. The company said other items flagged by Engadget, such as a magazine carrier and a toy-sized replica of an AK-47, didn't violate their policy. Google, which has banned weapons-related listings since 2012, prohibits parts that are ""essential to or enhance the functionality"" of a gun, such as stocks, clips, scopes and conversion kits.""Our hearts go out to the victims of gun violence. The sale of weapons, guns, and certain gun parts is strictly prohibited on Google Shopping.

A US-based venture capital is likely to join the round as a new investor. Bounce has already closed $120 million of the targeted round, another of the people cited above said. Apart from Accel and B Capital, Bounce�s other existing investors include New York based hedge fund Falcon Edge Capital, Chiratae Ventures, Maverick Ventures, Omidyar Network India, Sequoia Capital India, Qualcomm Ventures and Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal.Email queries sent to Vivekanand Hallekere, co-founder and CEO of Bounce, seeking more information in this regard, did not elicit responses at the time of publishing this report.The round will be used primarily to expand and scale up Bounce�s operations across the country and overseas.

6327,"India, 45 others sign UN treaty on mediation in trade disputes","India and 45 other United Nations members including the US and China, on Wednesday signed the Singapore Convention on Mediation, intended to help stabilise trade ties. The international treaty aims for the resolution of cross-border commercial and trade disputes as an alternative to court cases. ""The convention sets the standards for enforcing and invoking settlement agreements,"" the UN said.",Reuters,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Members of the United Nations on Wednesday signed the Singapore Convention on Mediation, an agreement it hopes will make it easier to settle cross-border commercial disputes and stabilise trade relationships. The U.N. Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation, its official title, was signed in Singapore by 46 U.N. members, including the United States and China. U.N. conventions are often named after the country or city where they are signed. The aim is to have a global framework that will give businesses greater confidence to settle international disputes through mediation rather than taking them to court, which can be obstructively time consuming and expensive.     �This will help advance international trade, commerce and investment,� said Singapore�s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the signing ceremony. �Today, a group of states have come together to recommit ourselves to multilateralism and to declare that we remain open for business.� Mediation is already used to settle commercial disputes in jurisdictions like the United States and the United Kingdom but it is not globally accepted. It is hoped the convention will improve the credibility of mediation. �Uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of settlement agreements had been the main obstacle of the greater use of mediation,� said UN Legal Affairs Assistant Secretary-General, Stephen Mathias.  �The convention sets the standards for enforcing and invoking settlement agreements, the requirements for reliance on settlement agreements and the grounds for refusing to grant relief.�  The naming of the convention is a coup for tiny Singapore, a city-state home to more than 130 foreign law firms that is vying to be an international legal hub as the number of commercial cross-border disputes rise.
