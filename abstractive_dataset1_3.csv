The CLW said undercover investigators worked in Foxconn's Zhengzhou plant in China, including one who was employed there for four years.",Engadget,"Foxconn and Apple have admitted to using far more temporary workers than allowed by Chinese law, according to a report from Bloomberg. The violation was discovered by China Labor Watch (CLW) after a long investigation and confirmed by both Foxconn and Apple. The group said that in August, temporary ""dispatch"" workers made up around half the workforce in August, where Chinese labor law allows a maximum of 10 percent. Both had vowed in the past to stop the practice, multiple times.Many of those workers were student interns, but even discounting that, temporary workers still made up to 30 percent of the workforce. Apple confirmed to Bloomberg that ""the percentage of dispatch workers exceeded our standards,"" adding that it's ""working closely with Foxconn to resolve this issue."" Foxconn also affirmed that it was violating laws by hiring too many temporary workers.Dispatch workers hired by third party firms can make higher base wages than full-time hires, but don't receive benefits like paid sick leave, vacations, medical benefits, unemployment insurance and pension contributions, according to CLW.The organization also found a number of other violations, saying that resignations often weren't approved during peak periods, student interns were working overtime during peak production in violation of laws, workers were putting in up to 100 hours of overtime per month (36 is the maximum allowed) and that some workers never received promised overtime bonuses. However, Apple denied many of the claims.""Most of the allegations are false,"" the company said. ""We have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labor."" Apple added that less than one percent of its workforce was student workers, and that only a small percentage had worked overtime in violation of laws. Those issues have now been corrected, it said.Apple's latest iPhone XS smartphones are reportedly more complex to produce than the iPhone X, requiring more workers. Apple and Foxconn aim to produce around 12,000 devices per shift, according to CLW.

2249,More Americans will die: Taliban after Trump ends Afghan talks,"US President Donald Trump's decision to cancel Afghan peace talks will cost more American lives, the Taliban has said. Trump abruptly cancelled the talks, aimed at ending the nearly 18-year-long war in Afghanistan, after Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul last week that killed an American soldier and 11 others.",Reuters,"KABUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump�s decision to cancel Afghan peace talks will cost more American lives, the Taliban said on Sunday while the United States promised to keep up military pressure on the militants, in a stunning reversal of efforts to forge a deal ending nearly 20 years of war in Afghanistan.  The Islamist group issued a statement after Trump unexpectedly canceled secret talks planned for Sunday with the Taliban�s major leaders at the presidential compound in Camp David, Maryland. He broke off the talks on Saturday after the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul last week that killed an American soldier and 11 others. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, criticized Trump for calling off the dialogue and said U.S. forces have been pounding Afghanistan with attacks at the same time. �This will lead to more losses to the U.S.,� he said. �Its credibility will be affected, its anti-peace stance will be exposed to the world, losses to lives and assets will increase.� In Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Afghan peace talks were on hold and Washington would not reduce U.S. military support for Afghan troops until it was convinced the Taliban could follow through on significant commitments. The United States has recalled U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad to chart the path forward, Pompeo said in appearances on Sunday TV news shows. Asked on �Fox News Sunday� whether Afghan talks were dead, Pompeo said, �For the time being they are.� Trump has long wanted to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan - since his days as a candidate - and American diplomats have been talking with Taliban representatives for months about a plan to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops in exchange for security guarantees by the Taliban.  U.S. and Taliban negotiators struck a draft peace deal last week that could have led to a drawdown of troops from America�s longest war. There are currently 14,000 U.S. forces as well as thousands of other NATO troops in the country, 18 years after its invasion by a U.S.-led coalition following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States. Fighting in Afghanistan has continued amid the talks and recent assaults by the Taliban cast doubts over the draft deal. As violence has escalated, Afghan leaders including President Ashraf Ghani have been increasingly critical of the deal and encouraged the Taliban to enter direct talks. Asked whether the collapse of talks put a U.S. troop pullout on hold as well, Pompeo said the issue would be discussed. �The president hasn�t yet made a decision on that,� he said on ABC�s �This Week.� Trump decided to get personally involved to get the agreement to the finish line at Camp David after �real progress�  had been made in talks, Pompeo said. �President Trump ultimately made the decision,� Pompeo told Fox. �He said, �I want to talk to (President) Ashraf Ghani. I want to talk to these Taliban negotiators. I want to look them in the eye. I want to see if we can get to the final outcome we needed.�� The U.S. president has touted his skills as a negotiator and personal rapport with world leaders including Kim Jong Un of North Korea, but such one-on-one diplomacy has not led to any breakthrough deals so far. Trump was criticized, even by some fellow Republicans, for having offered to host on U.S. soil a militant group that has killed American troops and had sheltered al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. �Camp David is where America�s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,� U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, a Republican whose father, Dick Cheney, was U.S. vice president at the time of the attacks, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. �No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.�  Americans will on Wednesday mark the 18th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Taliban fighters, who now control more territory than at any time since 2001, launched assaults over the past week that included a suicide attack in Kabul on Thursday that killed U.S. Army Sergeant Elis Barreto Ortiz, 34, from Puerto Rico.  Earlier this month, senior security officials in Kabul said joint air raids by U.S. and Afghan forces against the Taliban have not subsided. Pompeo said more than 1,000 Taliban fighters have been killed in Afghanistan in the last 10 days. Nine former U.S. ambassadors warned on Tuesday that Afghanistan could collapse in a �total civil war� if Trump withdraws all U.S. forces before the Kabul government and the Taliban conclude a peace settlement. Pompeo downplayed chances of a premature withdrawal. �President Trump made clear we�re not just going to withdraw because there�s a timeline. We�re only going to reduce our forces when certain conditions are met,� he said on CNN�s �State of the Union.�  Reporting by Abdul Qadir Sediqi in Kabul and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Additional reporting by Hamid Shalizi in Kabul; Valerie Volcovici and Steve Holland in Washington; Editing by Mary Milliken, Howard Goller and Lisa Shumaker",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan/more-americans-will-die-after-trump-abruptly-ends-afghan-talks-taliban-say-idUSKCN1VT05L?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2285,Porsche hikes stake in electric car startup Rimac Automobili,"German automobile manufacturer Porsche has increased its stake in Croatian electric sports car and electromobility components startup Rimac Automobili to 15.5%. In June 2018, the German sports car maker had purchased a 10% stake in Rimac for an undisclosed amount. ""We intend to intensify our collaboration in the field of battery technology,"" Porsche said.",TechCrunch,"Porsche  AG is increasing its stake in Croatian electric vehicle components and hypercar company Rimac Automobili . The increased stake is the latest effort by Porsche to invest more into electric mobility, particularly in battery technology.It was just 14 months ago that Porsche took a 10% stake in Rimac. Now, the German automaker is pushing that to 15.5%, according to an announcement Friday.Porsche intends to intensify its collaboration in the field of battery technology, said Lutz Meschke, deputy chairman of Porsche�s executive board. Porsche, which just introduced its all-electric Taycan sports car, has said it will invest more than $6 billion into electric mobility through 2025. The automaker spent more than $1 billion developing the Taycan, a cost that included expanding its factory.For the unfamiliar, Rimac was founded by Mate Rimac in 2009 and is perhaps best known for its electric hypercars, such as the two-seater C Two that it debuted in 2018 at the Geneva International Motor Show.The vehicle produces an extraordinary 1,914 horsepower, has a top speed of 256 miles per hour and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 1.85 seconds. That�s faster than Tesla�s next-generation Roadster prototype that CEO Elon Musk unveiled in November 2017. The Rimac�s battery is no slouch either, and gets 404 miles to a single charge under the more generous NEDC estimates. Still, that blows away other EVs on the market.�But Rimac, which is based in Zagreb and employs around 550 people, does more than produce hypercars. The company focuses on battery technology within the high-voltage segment, engineers and manufactures electric powertrains and develops digital interfaces between humans and machines. The company also develops and produces electric bikes. This strand of the business was established in 2013 in the form of the sister company Greyp Bikes.�Gaining Porsche as a stakeholder was one of the most important milestones in our history. The fact that Porsche is now increasing its stake is the best form of confirmation for our collaboration and represents the foundation for an even closer relationship,� Mate Rimac, the company�s founder said in a statement. �We are only at the start of our partnership � yet we have already met our high expectations. We have many collaborative ideas that we aim to bring to life in the future. The fundamental focus is creating a win-win situation for both partners and offering our end customers added value by developing exciting, electrified models.�Porsche isn�t the only automaker interested in Rimac. The company has already worked with Renault, Jaguar and Aston Martin. And in May 2019,�Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Motors jointly invested �80 million, or around $90 million, into Rimac. Under that deal, the three parties agreed to collaborate on the development of high-performance electric vehicles.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/porsche-increases-stake-in-electric-car-maker-rimac-automobili-to-15-5/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

While former minister and KCR's son KT Rama Rao and nephew Harish Rao were inducted into the cabinet, four new faces including two women were accommodated. The four new ministers are Sabitha Indra Reddy, Gangula Kamalakar, Satyavathi Rathod and Puvvada Ajay Kumar.",The News Minute,"Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) expanded his Council of Ministers on Sunday. While former minister and KCR�s son KT Rama Rao and nephew Harish Rao were inducted into the cabinet, four new faces including two women were accommodated. The four new ministers are Sabitha Indra Reddy, Gangula Kamalakar, Satyavati Rathod and Puvvada Ajay Kumar. With their induction, the Council of Ministers has now increased to 17 from 11. Sabitha and Satyavati are the only two women in KCR�s cabinet. All six ministers were sworn in on Sunday.This is first expansion after 11 members were inducted into the Telangana cabinet this February.�K Tarakarama Rao (KTR), who was left out of the cabinet after TRS returned to power in December 2018, has been made Minister of IT, Municipal Administration and Urban Development. These were very same portfolios KTR handled during KCR�s first term. As IT Minister, KTR is credited with bringing several industrial and IT projects to the state of Telangana. Following TRS�s sweep in the 2018 polls, he was made working president of the party following the electionsIn 2009, KTR made his electoral debut, winning from Siricilla. KTR went on to win in 2014 elections as well, while the 2018 polls saw him win with a margin over 1 lakh votes. KCR, however, chose to depute him to party affairs following TRS�s thumping win. Harish Rao has been made Finance Minister. He was former irrigation minister between 2014 and 2018.A prot�g� of KCR and the founding member of TRS, Harish Rao has never lost an election and was elected MLA from Siddipet for the sixth consecutive time.Harish Rao is credited with being the driving force behind the commissioning of the ambitious Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, during his previous tenure. Though the leader enjoys a strong support among TRS cadre, there has been speculation of a rift between cousins KTR and Harish Rao. While Harish was touted to be the immediate successor to KCR, KTR�s return from US in 2006 and entry into politics shifted the narrative.However the two leaders have dismissed the speculations as rumours, with both reiterating that they �grew up as brothers�. KTR and Harish Rao's re-induction is being dubbed as the CM's attempt to rejuvenate the government while the induction of fresh faces is seen as a pacification of the respective communities they hail from.Sabitha Indra Reddy, a former stalwart of Telangana Congress, has been allocated the Education portfolio, which was earlier vested with G Jagadish Reddy. Jagadish has been made Energy Minister. Jagadish had come under fire earlier this year following the Intermediate (+2 ) results. Around 20 students killed themselves following alleged mismanagement and flaws in the results. Several student groups and opposition parties had sought his resignation.Sabitha had defected along with her son Karthik Reddy to the ruling party in March this year. A key leader in Ranga Reddy district near Hyderabad, Sabitha Reddy was Home Minister in the YS Rajasekhara Reddy government. She was elected from Maheswaram Assembly constituency on a Congress ticket last year.Sabitha entered politics after her husband�s death in 2000, and has held multiple portfolios in the state cabinet in her political career spanning almost two decades.Gangula Kamalakar, a three-time MLA from Karimnagar, has been allocated BC Welfare, Food and Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs. Gangula hails from Munnuru Kapu community, which is having a significant populace in the Karimnagar and Nizamabad belt.Nizamabad MP and daughter of KCR K Kavita lost her seat to BJP's Arvind Dharmapuri, who also comes from Munnuru Kapu community.TRS's Vinod Kumar who was Karimnagar MP lost to BJP's Bandi Sanjay, who is also from Munnuru Kapu community, in the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections.Etela Rajendar, who is already holding the portfolio of Health and Family Welfare also heads the Huzurabad constituency in Karimnagar.Satyavati Rathod, another woman MLC hailing from the Tribal community has also been made Minister for ST Welfare and Women and Child Welfare.

2302,I feel like I have evolved as a cricketer: Hanuma Vihari,"India batsman Hanuma Vihari has said that he ""personally feels"" he has evolved as a cricketer. Vihari, who scored 289 runs at an average of 96.33 to become the highest run-scorer in the recently concluded Test series against West Indies, said, ""For me, I have got better with every game."" The 25-year-old made his Test debut in September 2018.",Cricket Country,"It took Hanuma Vihari four full seasons of domestic cricket to make his Duleep Trophy debut and nearly nine seasons and close to 5000 First Class runs to make his international debut. Playing the waiting game sure is nothing new for the 25-year-old. But, that prolonged toil in the domestic circuit has now made things easier for Vihari, so he says. �I will say that it makes the job easier playing international cricket, once you have worked hard at the domestic level,� Vihari tells CricketCountry, fresh off his successful tour of West Indies with the national team.ALSO READ: For me, every Test match is my last, went into West Indies tour with a clean slate: Hanuma Vihari�Because you face so many situations, experience so many situations, different kinds of pressure. That way, I was fortunate enough to play so many years in domestic, before making international debut. So that experience really helps; once you get 5000 runs in domestic cricket, you know what you have to do if you face a similar situation at the international level,� says Vihari who was the highest run-getter in the series with 289 runs at an average of 96.33. ALSO READ: Hanuma Vihari credits coach Ravi Shastri for improved batting performanceWith his stellar showing in the Caribbean, Vihari has more or less sealed India�s No.6 slot for himself in Tests. Vihari has demonstrated exceedingly well, his ability to adapt in his three overseas tour so far, something he believes is the key to success at this level. �The challenges (on the three tours) have been different, conditions have been different and each one poses a different challenge,� he says. �For me, I have got better with every game and I feel the six games I have played so far �  from debut to last game � I have personally felt like I have evolved as a cricketer. ALSO READ: Hanuma Vihari hopes to sustain batting form in home series against South Africa�There are some tactical changes you do during the game, according to the pitch, the bowler. We have to be tactful about it and sometimes it happens instinctively, sometimes after you have analysed the bowler (and his strategy). There is no major change with my technique, but things change as per the situation. I look for things which may help my game, and I do do that.�  While adapting to the situation and playing accordingly may seem like a quite straightforward plan, it is easier said than done � even for the best. Probing more on that point, Vihari reveals it�s more about the mind at this level. �Firstly, it comes in the mind. If you train your mind that you have to play according to the situation no matter what, the skills will take over; that�s what I feel,� elaborates Vihari. �At this level, you have the skills, it is the mindset that has to be be tuned well and you have to have the right mindset. Personally, I keep the team goals ahead of my personal ones � that makes it a lot easier for me, tuning my mind and reading the situation for the team, rather than focus on my personal milestone.�During the West Indies series, Vihari spent the most time in the middle with Ajinkya Rahane, amassing 338 partnership runs across two Tests. Rahane was the second-highest run-getter of the series (271) and batting with him was an opportunity for Vihari to learn. �He is an excellent player and has played 50 plus games for India and as you said he was under a little bit of pressure (before the series). But the way he handled it and the way he was calm in the middle � especially in the first innings of the first Test, that set the tone for us. We were struggling early on and he came in a build a good partnership, that set the tone for the whole series, I am sure that he is satisfied with his effort to help the team win an important tour overseas.�Especially in the first Test, second innings, I was looking to accelerate, and at that point in time he told me to choose the ball you want to hit and that kind of stuff. We were talking a lot, communicating a lot. No.5 and No.6 are such positions that you bat together often. So we want to build a good rapport, and keep performing the same way as we did in the West Indies,� he says. Vihari now is looking forward for the home season, which interestingly, starts in his home ground of Visakhapatnam with the first Test against South Africa, beginning October 2. �I have not set any targets as such. I am playing in my hometown, in Vizag, the first game for South Africa Tests. I�m really excited and hopefully fans will come out in large numbers to show their support,� Vihari says.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/its-mind-over-matter-for-hanuma-vihari-889049?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2303,Multiple US states launch antitrust probe of Facebook,"A coalition of attorneys general from several US states on Friday announced the antitrust investigation of Mark Zuckerberg-led social media giant Facebook on whether it ""stifled competition"". It will also determine whether Facebook's actions endangered consumers' data and increased the price of advertising. Similar antitrust probes are expected against ""dominant"" technology firms like Google.",YourStory,"A coalition of US states announced on Friday an antitrust investigation of Facebook, in the first of what is expected to be a wave of action against dominant technology firms.New York state Attorney General Letitia James released a statement announcing the action on behalf of seven other states and the District of Columbia to probe ""whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk."" The move marks the first official US antitrust action against one of the so-called Big Tech companies -- although a landmark case had targeted Microsoft back in the 1990s.""Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,"" James said.Joining the action were attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and Tennessee, said James.Facebook did not immediately respond to an AFP query on the announcement.Earlier this year the US Justice Department said it would launch a ""review"" of major online platforms to determine if they have stifled innovation or reduced competition.It was not immediately clear if the states would be working in coordination with federal officials.Facebook, by far the largest social network, in the past has claimed it is not a monopoly and that consumers have many choices for how to connect with people online.The new probe ""shows how unease with large tech companies is spreading beyond Congress and the federal government agencies to the states. With each passing day, there are greater fears about these companies controlling our online lives,"" said Michael Carrier, a professor antitrust law at Rutgers University.The case may be the first in a series of antitrust actions against Big Tech firms and highlights growing ""techlash,"" based on worries about dominant platforms which control the flow of information.A separate coalition of states was set to launch an antitrust action, with Google reportedly a target.The office of the Texas attorney general scheduled an event Monday in Washington with a ""broad coalition of states"" to unveil a multistate probe into ""whether large tech companies have engaged in anti-competitive behaviour that stifled competition, restricted access, and harmed consumers.""Asked about the move, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: ""Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country. We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.""Maurice Stucke, a University of Tennessee law professor, said he expects one of the areas being investigated will be online advertising markets, which are dominated by Google and Facebook.""This is a great area to look at because the market has been criticized as being opaque,"" Stucke said.But Stucke said the investigations may go further by looking at how tech platforms control data, potentially examining ""the intersection between competition law and privacy."" Amazon and Apple may also be in the crosshairs. Critics have complained that Amazon wields too much power in online retail, and that Apple may disadvantage rivals offering services in its app store.In the European Union, Google has faced a series of antitrust actions and Amazon is now being targeted by enforcers.Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made a breakup of the big tech firms a part of her campaign platform.But some analysts say the case against the tech firms faces challenges because the companies have in many cases provided services for free and brought prices down, making it hard to prove they harmed ""consumer welfare,"" the legal standard applied under judicial precedent.Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a recent research note that ""a broad movement to break up companies solely because they are large will fail without a change to existing antitrust laws,"" which he said is ""exceedingly unlikely."" But Stucke said it would be wrong to view antitrust law as solely focused on consumer prices, and that it may be applied to questions of competition and innovation.The probes could end up with a variety of outcomes including fines, restrictions on conduct or a breakup, Stucke maintained.""You'd have to show how the remedy would address the concerns,"" he said.(Via Agence France Presse)",https://yourstory.com/2019/09/us-states-antitrust-probe-facebook-mark-zuckerberg?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2304,Google confirms antitrust review by US Department of Justice,"Google has acknowledged it is facing scrutiny under the US Department of Justice's review of online platforms. Google said it's been asked to provide information about the past antitrust investigations it has faced, adding it also expects similar inquiries from US state attorneys general. In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission cleared Google from 'search bias' allegations in an antitrust probe.",Engadget,"Google has confirmed that it's one of the targets of the Justice Department's review of competition in tech.  The search firm has revealed that DOJ officials asked it to provide information about ""past investigations,"" with an SEC filing also referencing the request.  It expected state attorneys general to make similar demands in the future, and planned to work ""constructively"" with regulators.This doesn't mean the DOJ expects to find wrongdoing.  The review is largely intended to reexamine tech companies' dominance in light of evolving market conditions.  It comes just days after a reported plan for a multi-state antitrust investigation, though, and it may not be so fortunate on that front.There's simultaneously little doubt that Google is anxious about potential regulatory action.  It opened its response to the DOJ inquiry by claiming that Google services ""create more choice,"" support ""thousands"" of jobs and businesses and pouring money into research projects that ""spur innovation.""  Google knows that officials could demand drastic changes (such as undoing acquisitions and splitting up the company), and it wants to dissuade those attempts by portraying itself as an essential part of American society.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/07/google-acknowledges-doj-scrutiny/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2315,Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa planning to resign soon: Nikkei,"Nissan Motors CEO Hiroto Saikawa reportedly said that he plans to resign soon, amid doubts over Nissan's recovery, Nikkei said on Sunday. This comes following reports last week that he and other executives were paid more than they were entitled to. Saikawa took responsibility for scandals involving ex-Chairman Carlos Ghosn and will reportedly leave once as a successor is found.",Reuters,"YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) CEO Hiroto Saikawa will resign on Sept. 16, the automaker said on Monday, bowing to pressure after he admitted to being improperly overpaid and marking further upheaval at a company battered by scandal and plunging profit. Saikawa, who admitted to the overpayment of around $440,000 last week, will be temporarily replaced by Chief Operating Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi, with a permanent replacement expected by the end of October, Japan�s second-largest automaker said. His sudden resignation, which comes before a long-term succession plan has been decided, marks a dramatic exit for a man who had been tasked with righting the automaker following the arrest and ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year on charges of financial misconduct, which Ghosn denies.  Saikawa, a protege of Ghosn, took over as Nissan CEO from his mentor in 2017, leaving Ghosn as chairman. His brief tenure has been characterized by strain with top shareholder Renault SA (RENA.PA) and tumbling profit. Nissan�s shares have lost almost a quarter of their value this year. The worsening relationship with Renault has been a particular concern for investors and has cast doubt on the future of the Franco-Japanese automaking alliance at a time of sweeping change and uncertainty in the global auto industry. �Saikawa recently has indicated his inclination to resign, and in line with his desire to pass the baton to a new generation of leaders at Nissan, he will resign on Sept. 16,� Nissan�s chairman of the board, Yasushi Kimura, told a news conference. Among the candidates to lead the maker of the Rogue SUV crossover and the Leaf all-battery electric car are non-Japanese, women, and those hailing from Renault, the chairman of Nissan�s nomination committee, Masakazu Toyoda, told reporters. Addressing reporters alone at the end of a late-night news conference, the 65-year-old Saikawa expressed regret for his failure to turn around the firm which he has said had long chased market share at all costs under Ghosn�s tenure, undermining profitability. �I had hoped to solve all of these issues before stepping down,� he said, referring to the automaker�s problems. �But I haven�t been able to, and for that I apologize.� Stoic and contrite, Saikawa also took aim at his former mentor, saying he hoped that Ghosn and former director Greg Kelly felt regret for Nissan�s current situation resulting from their financial misconduct. Kelly also denies any wrongdoing, as both await separate trials in Japan. Saikawa said he would return the improper compensation, having conceded he was wrong to appoint a separate team led by Kelly to manage his share-based salary incentive scheme. An internal investigation found that the procedure violated company rules, although it was not illegal.  While Saikawa has said he did not intend to break the rules, his admission of overpayment has pitched Nissan into fresh crisis and appears to have accelerated the push for a replacement. The nomination committee, established in June to find a successor, was now speeding up its search to find a successor from a list containing around 10 possible candidates. The committee is made up of six company outsiders, including Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard.  Those on the list include Jun Seki, tasked with Nissan�s performance recovery; Yamauchi, the COO; and Makoto Uchida, chairman of Nissan�s management committee in China, an alliance source has told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. A key question will be how Saikawa�s successor approaches  the alliance with Renault. Seki has been seen as a front-runner to become CEO. Prior to his latest promotion in June, the 58-year-old oversaw Nissan�s expansion in China, now the automaker�s top market. He joined the company in 1986.  Yamauchi, 63, is widely seen as a bridge between the alliance partners, and the near four-decade Nissan veteran is known to be well-regarded at Renault where he serves as a board member. Nissan also said that a nearly year-long internal probe prompted by Ghosn�s arrest in November had found that Ghosn and Kelly were responsible for financial misconduct at the company totaling around 35 billion yen ($326.98 million). Improper activities included concealing Ghosn�s salary, using company assets for personal purposes, and improper payments using Nissan funds that eventually were transferred to Ghosn and a firm related to him, the company said.

The general public has also understood the importance of not using PoP. Since there is an awareness, obviously the demand for PoP has gone down.�Apart from the awareness campaigns, BBMP had carried out drives seizing PoP idols from key areas in the city ahead of the festival.

Justice AK Mittal, Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court, was recommended to take her place as the Madras High Court Chief Justice.

Sonakshi added that she's been busiest over the past few years and has four releases this year.",Times Now,"After a series of flops over the past few years, Sonakshi Sinha is finally part of a big hit. Mission Mangal, the Independence Day multistarrer release that features her in the cast, has been declared a superhit by the trade after a Rs 193.14 crore domestic haul at the last count.

""I feel great. For me at least, it (success) has been long overdue. It feels nice. It's a very special film and working with the team was a wonderful experience. It is a very positive feeling. Hats off to those scientists who actually made it happen, and went through so much of difficulties and struggles,"" Sonakshi told IANS, adding that she was always confident about Mission Mangal.

""Honestly, I did expect the film to be successful because it talks about a very big achievement of our country. I feel, if you make a film on patriotism and the subject is good, it always works,"" she said.

Mission Mangal�starring Akshay Kumar with Vidya Balan, Sonakshi Sinha, Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari, Nithya Menen and Sharman Joshi, may be one of the biggest hits of 2019 so far, but Sonakshi has seen consecutive duds over the past few years. Films such as Tevar, Akira, Noor�and Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi�crashed, and she became an easy target for trolls on social media. However, the 32-year-old actress chooses to keep negativity at bay and focus on her job instead.

""Everybody has their ups and downs, not only actors. Even a rikshawallah has ups and downs. That's normal. That is how you grow as a person. I don't care what trolls and haters say because I am still here and they are still there. I have this quality that I can shut out all negativity and for me. It is very important to focus on my work, stay positive and move forward. If few of my films have not done well, people have not stopped offering me films. In fact, I've been busiest over the past few years, and I have four releases this year,"" she said.

Sonakshi made her Bollywood debut with Dabangg�opposite Salman Khan in 2010, and she is still known as the Dabangg Girl. She returned in Dabangg 2, which released in 2012. This year, Dabangg 3�is scheduled to hit the screens in December.

How does it feel like, to return as Rajjo, in the third instalment of the blockbuster series that continues to be her calling card? ""I can't explain the feeling in words. For me, it's like homecoming. It's like going back to where you began. What I am and where I am today is because of Dabangg, because of Salman Khan, Arbaaz Khan and the family. They made me Rajjo and, for me, there was no looking back after that. For me, it's always going to be the most special film of my life. It's just great reuniting with the entire team. Most of the team members are there right from the first part -- the DOP, his crew, the assistant directors. It feels like I am working on my first film all over again,"" said Sonakshi.

Prabhu Deva takes over as director of the series in Dabangg 3, and the film will have a new villain by way of Kannada superstar Sudeep. Pankaj Tripathi joins the cast while Mouni Roy and Warina Hussain have been signed up for special dance numbers.

Prabhu Deva has directed Sonakshi in Rowdy Rathore, R�Rajkumar�and Action Jackson�in the past.

""Prabhu sir has brought in some amazing twists and turns in to the franchise with the way he shot the film. He has brought in a lot of freshness to the film,"" said the actress.

After Dabangg 3, Sonakshi will be seen alongside Ajay Devgn in Bhuj: The Pride Of India. Before signing off, Sonakshi also hinted that a biopic featuring her in the lead will be announced soon.

MIT had earlier admitted getting $800,000-donations from Epstein.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - The director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology�s Media Lab stepped down on Saturday after a New Yorker magazine article revealed that the lab tried to conceal donations from disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein, the university said. �This afternoon, Joi Ito submitted his resignation as Director of the Media Lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute,� MIT President Rafael Reif said in a letter posted online. Ito could not be reached for immediate comment. The New York Times and New Yorker reported he said in an internal email,  �After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately.�          Last month, Reif said that the elite university would review its process for accepting donations after taking about $800,000 from foundations controlled by Epstein, who committed suicide while in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The New Yorker article uncovered deeper fundraising ties between the Media Lab and Epstein and said the institution had actively tried to conceal the extent of its connections with the disgraced financier.  On Saturday, Reif described the acceptance of contributions from Epstein as a �mistake of judgment� and said he had instructed MIT�s general counsel to bring in a prominent law firm to investigate the matter.  �Because the accusations in the (New Yorker) story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation,� Reif said. Ito previously apologized for having accepted donations from Epstein and had said he would raise an amount equivalent to the donations the lab received from foundations controlled by Epstein and �direct those funds to non-profits that focus on supporting survivors of trafficking.� The New Yorker said Ito disclosed this week that he received a further $1.2 million from Epstein for investment funds under Ito�s control and $525,000 for the lab. Epstein also secured $7.5 million in donations from for the lab from other wealthy individuals.

Measures include targeted approach that uses 'early warning system' during critical periods like elections or when lives may be at risk. The move comes following criticism of technology firms for not doing enough to prevent spread of 'false news'.",Engadget,"Tech companies know disinformation remains a major threat, and they're forming an alliance with a media giant to help fight the online spread of falsehoods.  The BBC has partnered with Facebook, Google and Twitter on a strategy to fight fake news and other disinformation campaigns.  The effort will include an ""early warning system"" that lets organizations tell each other when they find false content that ""threatens human life or disrupts democracy.""  Ideally, this helps companies quickly neuter disinformation before it has much of a chance to spread.The plan also involves a joint media education campaign, shared learning (with a focus on elections) and voting information.  More details are coming ""at a later date,"" the BBC said.The timing of the collaboration likely isn't a coincidence.  Internet giants know that the 2020 US presidential election is fast approaching, and they're already working with intelligence agencies to tackle disinformation and security risks.  The companies don't want any risk of repeating the missteps from 2016, and that means forging pacts with anyone that can further their goals.  While the BBC clearly isn't based in the US, its work could be useful for fighting election meddling in the country on top of any help it can offer abroad.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/07/bbc-facebook-google-twitter-fight-fake-news/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The companies are in danger, while trade is in doldrums,"" she said in a tweet in Hindi.""Through drama, deceit, lies, and propaganda, they are trying to hide the country's grim situation,"" she said, using the hashtag '100DaysNoVikas' (100 days, no development).""Three words that describe the first 100 days of BJP 2.0 - tyranny, chaos and anarchy,"" the Congress said earlier in a series of tweets.""Eight sectors have recorded a growth rate below two per cent and our finance minister still refuses to accept that our economy is in free fall. If the BJP continues this path of negligence & deceit, we are headed towards a recession,"" the party said.Sibal said the massive mandate to the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls had given it an opportunity to provide relief to the common man, but what happened was the opposite.""Common man's problems are increasing, lapdog media is becoming even more biased, atrocities against women increasing, there is no strategy on education and health, small trader is in distress, and there is vendetta politics against political opponents,"" he alleged.He claimed that the Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are being misused.""Where there is evidence against their own people, they are sheltering them, and action is being taken against opposition leaders against whom there is no evidence,"" Sibal said.The government's arrogance reflects in legislation being passed without parliamentary scrutiny as well as in decisions such as abrogation of Article 370, dilution of the Right to Information Act, criminalisation of triple talaq, the merger of banks and the RBI made to transfer 1.76 lakh crore record surplus to the government, he said.Accusing the government of practising vendetta politics, Sibal, in a statement, said in the cases of P Chidambaram, D K Shivakumar's arrest, MNS's Raj Thackeray, NCP's Ajit Pawar , TMC's Partha Chatterjee and Kamal Nath's nephew, probe agencies haven't charge-sheeted the leaders for particular crimes.""The agencies apply the law selectively on opposition leaders while those belonging to the BJP are given an easy escape route,"" he said, listing cases such as those of Kuldeep Sengar (Unnao rape accused), Mukul Roy (Saradha chit fund scam), Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa (land and mining scam) and Shivraj Singh Chouhan (Vyapam scam).

At least 2,500 hotels are empty. 15,000 salesmen working in major markets have lost their jobs. While the government has directed schools to open, parents prefer not to send their children to school owing to the prevailing situation,"" he said.The former Union minister said he was surprised over the government's assertion that easing of curbs in J-K depends on ""Pakistan's behaviour"".""I didn't understand what this statement means? If Pakistan continues terror activities, then you will not bring any improvement in the condition of your citizens,"" he asked.On the NRC, Sibal said many of the 1.9 million people, who are genuine citizens have been left out which has created chaos and they brace an uncertain future.He alleged there was a lot of ""anguish"" prevailing in the country over the slump in the auto industry and highlighted the problems being faced by textile, gold and real estate sectors.Citing figures from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), he said the overall unemployment has now touched 8.2 per cent, with urban unemployment as high as 9.4 per cent.As there is suspense over whether scientists would be able to make contact with Chandrayaan-2's lander, there is also deep suspense over whether the economy will recover in the near future, Sibal said.The Congress, in a short video on its official Twitter handle, hit out at the BJP over issues such as ""unemployment, dilution of RTI, UAPA, GDP, bank frauds, lynchings, falling of rupee, J&K bifurcation, and mishandling of NRC"".On lynchings in the country, it said, ""The term 'mob lynching' in the BJP government has greatly damaged India's fraternity.Involvement of people associated with the ruling ideology in promoting mobilized violence is a big threat to the unity, the integrity of the country.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/sep/08/rahul-gandhi-congratulates-modi-government-on-100-days-of-no-development-2030699.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2340,Dont fear hefty challans if you abide by the law: Gadkari,"Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said there should be no fear of hefty 'challans' if one is abiding by the law. Post imposition of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 from September 1 the fines for traffic violation have been increased steeply. Gadkari also said the government has completed 70% of work of fixing 786 accidental spots.",The New Indian Express,"NEW DELHI: Intelligent traffic system does not discriminate between violators of law whether it is a central minister, chief minister, bureaucrat or a journalist, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Sunday while asserting hefty fines for traffic rule violations are aimed at curbing road accidents.He also stressed that there should be no fear of hefty ""challans"" if someone is abiding by the law. Post imposition of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, from September 1, hefty challans for traffic rules violations by the police have hit the headlines.""Why is this fear of challans if one is following traffic rules. People should rather be happy that India's roads will become safer like abroad where people strictly abide by traffic norms. Is human life not precious,"" Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari told PTI in an interview.Gadkari said stringent rules were ""much needed"" as people had taken traffic laws very lightly and there was neither fear nor respect for law. ""I am sensitive to this issue. Ask the family members who have lost someone near and dear in road accidents. 65 per cent of the road accidents victims are in the age bracket of 18 to 35 years, ask their families how they feel. I too am an accident victim and it is a well-thought-of step with consent from almost all political parties whether Congress, Trinamool or TRS,"" he said.He said there are people who have not even been once fined as they follow traffic norms asking why others cannot emulate them.Asked there have been multiple instances of hefty penalties where challans issued surpassed the cost of the vehicle, the minister said they were slapped multiple fines on account of multiple offences and instances had come to his notice where offenders lacked licence, pollution clearance, insurance etc.""Intelligent traffic system does not discriminate. If you violate the law, you will have to pay penalty whether you are central minister, Chief Minister, bureaucrat or a journalist. There have been instances in my knowledge where CMs and others have been slapped with challans,"" he said.He appealed to the people to use the digital platforms like DigiLocker or mParivahan to carry Driving Licence, Registration Certificate or other documents in 'electronic form' which are valid under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and present them to traffic police if asked.These electronic records available on DigiLocker or mParivahan are deemed to be legally recognised at par with the original documents as per the provisions of the Information Technology Act and the Motor Vehicles Act. As per the Motor Act, the owner/driver has to produce the documents -- licence or certificate of registration etc to the authority on demand.About states, he said that all the states are on board and have started implementing the new provisions and Tamil Nadu could play a role model as implementation has resulted in 28 per cent drop in accidents in the state. India accounts for 5 lakh road accidents annually, one of the highest in the globe in which 1.5 lakh people die and another 3 lakh are crippled.The minister said the loss to the GDP was 2 per cent due to loss of lives in road accidents Asked about poor infrastructure in some parts, Gadkari said the new Act has provisions of fine on contractors in case of potholes and penalty was higher in case of offences committed by implementing authorities.The minister said that NHAI has completed 70 per cent of the work pertaining to fixing of 786 accidental spots at a cost of about Rs 12,000 crore. In addition, states have been asked to identify black spots which will be corrected at a cost of about Rs 14,000 crore.The legislation provides for stricter punishment for various traffic-related offences as well as higher penalties, including compensation of Rs 5 lakh for death and Rs 2.5 lakh for grievous injury in a motor vehicle accident case.The Act provides for a penalty of Rs 10,000 for not giving way to emergency vehicles and Rs 10,000 for driving despite disqualification. Penalty for dangerous driving has been increased to Rs 5,000 from Rs 1,000, while drunken driving under the new law attracts a fine of Rs 10,000. Penalties for over-speeding range from Rs 1,000- 2,000.Driving without insurance is punishable with Rs 2,000 fine while driving without a helmet will attract Rs 1,000 penalty and 3-month suspension of licence. Also, the guardian/owner will be deemed guilty in case of road offence by juveniles, while registration of the vehicle will be cancelled.Traffic violations now attract a penalty of Rs 500 in place of Rs 100 earlier, while disobedience of orders of authorities will attract a minimum penalty of Rs 2,000 in place of Rs 500 earlier. Cab-aggregators violating licensing conditions will be charged a sum of up to Rs 1 lakh, while overloading of vehicles would attract a penalty of Rs 20,000.Penalty for unauthorised use of vehicles without a licence has been fixed at Rs 5,000 while those driving without a licence will have to shell out the same amount and those found driving despite disqualification would be fined Rs 10,000.The penalties are based on the recommendations of transport ministers from 18 states, which were vetted by a standing committee of Parliament.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/sep/08/interview-stringent-traffic-rules-aim-at-curbing-road-accidents-nitin-gadkari-2030685.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2409,Putin warned Bush of attack 2 days before 9/11: Ex-CIA analyst,"Russian President Vladimir Putin had warned his then-American counterpart George W Bush of an impending terrorist attack two days before the 9/11 attacks in 2001, former CIA analyst George Beebe has said in his book. Putin told Bush that it was ""something long in preparation"" coming out of Afghanistan, Beebe wrote. Around 3,000 people were killed in the 9/11 attacks.",RT,"The urgent warning coming from the Russian leader is mentioned in the book �The Russia Trap: How Our Shadow War with Russia Could Spiral into Nuclear Catastrophe,� released earlier this week and written by George Beebee, a senior Bush-era CIA analyst.Putin had telephoned President Bush two days before the attacks to warn that Russian intelligence has detected signs of an incipient terrorist campaign, �something long in preparation,� coming out of Afghanistan.The revelation by the former CIA operative appears to be yet another proof that Washington has been repeatedly warned about the attacks that ultimately happened on September 11, 2001.While the existence of a warning from Moscow has been public knowledge for years � senior Russian intelligence officials spoke about them shortly after the attacks � Beebee�s book suggests that it was not limited to exchange between the intelligence agencies, and that Bush was warned by Putin personally.In addition to Russia, the US had been reportedly warned by the British spies, and the danger of impending attacks had been repeatedly highlighted by both the CIA and the FBI. Whether the White House actually heeded those warnings and did everything it could to protect its citizens still remains a mystery.�Some hints at the mindset of the White House officials at the time are contained in the memoirs of Condoleezza Rice, then national security advisor and later secretary of state.In �No Higher Honor,� Rice confesses that she dismissed an earlier warning from Putin about Saudi-funded extremists in Pakistan that he said would eventually cause a �major catastrophe.�Rice wrote that she dismissed the warning and �chalked it up to Russian bitterness toward Pakistan for supporting the Afghan mujahideen� during the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan.Like this story?

It was probably one big partnership away from breaking the back of that chase, but we were outdone by a piece of brilliance from Malinga.�It was nice to get a partnership towards the end and it would�ve been nice to hang around for a little longer.

2415,Australia should go for the kill now in 4th Ashes Test: Ponting,"Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has said that Australia have to go ""all guns blazing"" and just ""go in for the kill now"" to win the fourth Ashes Test in Manchester. He added that Australia have bounced back well after letting the opportunity of winning the third Test slip. ""Opportunities like this don't come around always,"" he further stated.",Cricket Country,"Having taken advantage late on Day 3, Ricky Ponting believes now is the right time for Australia to go all out against England in Manchester.ASHES 2019 FULL SCHEDULE | ASHES 2019 LATEST NEWSEngland fought back well through Joe Root and Rory Burns� half-centuries but Josh Hazlewood�s three-wicket burst kept the home team to 200 for 5, behind Australia by 297 runs and Ponting feels now is the right time for the Ashes holders to go full throttle and acquire back the lead in the series which the squandered after defeat in the previous Test at Leeds.Ashes, 4th Test: Live Scorecard�Australia have to go all guns blazing to win this game, do everything they can to win this game and then worry about the recovery and turnaround for the next Test match,� Ponting told cricket.com.au. �Opportunities like this don�t come around all the time. �They let one slip in the last Test in Leeds, they�ve bounced back strong in this game so far and they�ve just got to go in for the kill now.�A shortened day (on Friday) might help the bowlers recover but they�ve got to try and do everything they can to try and bowl Australia to victory in these next two days.�While England have not found it easy against Australia�s fast bowlers, Ponting feels offspinner Nathan Lyon will be the key considering the way the wicket is playing. In Edgbaston, it was Lyon�s 6/49 which delivered a 251-run win for Australia, and the former skipper feels Lyon can produce another special performance over the weekend.�As far as I�m concerned, Lyon 100 per cent holds the key to Australia winning the Test,� Ponting said. �The quicks have been outstanding and got all the wickets so far, but I have just got the feeling if Nathan gets it right, he�s going to be a real handful late in the game.�He is getting a lot of turn and bounce and it�s not going to be an easy wicket for any batsman to start on because of that bounce and spin he is getting. Jack Leach (England�s left-arm spinner) will get it in the second innings too if Australia happen to bat again. There�s just been enough there to keep the bowlers in the game.�Lyon seemed a bit off on Day 3 bowling 26 overs and going wicketless. As England rebuild through Root and Burns� 141-run partnership for the third wicket, both batsmen played Lyon well, but now with Australia getting a sniff at the tail, Ponting has backed Lyon to pick himself up.�If you think of Nathan through his career, it�s been his consistency and how often he hits the same spot (that has made him successful),� Ponting said. �And today and particularly to the left-hander Burns, he was really short, he (was) played of the back foot almost every ball.�A bit the same with Root. You could see the way Root wants to play him, off the back foot when the ball is pitching just outside off stump and he looks to sweep him if it�s fuller and wider outside the off stump.�So Lyon was just a little bit inconsistent, but it�s an unusual day for him so I�m sure he�ll bounce back late in this innings and in the second innings as well.�",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/ashes-4th-test-australia-should-go-for-the-kill-at-old-trafford-ricky-ponting-888996?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2429,Warner gives thumbs up to English fan who called him 'f***ing cheat',"A video of Australia opener David Warner's reaction to an England fan calling him 'f***ing cheat' has gone viral. In the video, Warner can be seen going down the stairs with the rest of his teammates when the fan hurled abuse at him. Warner then looked back at him and gave a double thumbs up.",CricTracker,"David Warner has had to face quite a bit of hostility from the English crowd in the ongoing Ashes against England. The southpaw has been facing the same from the opening Test at the Edgbaston in Birmingham itself. In that game when he got out, a section of the crowd brought out the Sandpaper, reminding him of the ball-tampering scandal he was involved in the Newlands Test last year.But Warner has been able to keep his calm and hasn�t responded in an aggressive manner. The shambolic saga in South Africa earned him a lot of criticism from the netizens. During one of the games, when he was fielding at the boundary, the crowd asked him whether he has sandpaper in his pocket. Warner didn�t get fussed by the situation and he showed his pocket to the people.AdvertisementThe Aussies are currently playing the fourth Test at the Old Trafford in Manchester and Warner was greeted with some harsh behavior from one of the fans. At a time when Warner was going down the stairs with the rest of his teammates, a fan shouted and called him a �f***ing cheat�. Warner looked back at him and gave him a thumbs up, saying a thank you, suggesting that he doesn�t care.On the field, Warner hasn�t had the best of times by any stretch of the imagination. He has strained while facing the new ball, especially against Stuart Broad, who has dismissed on a number of instances. In seven innings of the series, Warner has only managed a mere 79 runs at a rather dismal average of 11.28. In fact, 61 of those runs came in the first innings of the Leed�s Test.Apart from that, his scores have been 2, 8, 3, 5, 0. Like Steve Smith, even he made his comeback into Test cricket after a gap of 16 months following the one-year suspension meted out by Cricket Australia (CA). Warner scored tons of runs in the World Cup and was expected to carry on, but he has been a bit of a disappointment. He�ll be desperate to get some runs under his belt.",https://www.crictracker.com/ashes-2019-david-warner-responds-funnily-after-a-fan-called-him-a-fing-cheat/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The tanker, which was seized by Gibraltar over suspicions of carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions, was freed after receiving formal written assurances from Iran.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - The Iranian oil tanker Adrian Darya 1 at the center of a dispute between Tehran and Western powers, which went dark off Syria earlier in the week, has been photographed by satellite off the Syrian port of Tartus, Maxar Technologies Inc., a U.S. space technology company said on Saturday. Maxar�s supplied image shows the tanker Adrian Darya 1 very close to Tartus on Sept. 6. The ship appeared to have turned off its transponder in the Mediterranean west of Syria, Refinitiv ship-tracking data showed on Tuesday. The tanker, which is loaded with Iranian crude oil, sent its last signal giving its position between Cyprus and Syria sailing north at 15:53 GMT on Monday, the data showed.  The vessel, formerly named Grace 1, was detained by British Royal Marine commandos off Gibraltar on July 4 as it was suspected to be en route to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.  Two weeks later, Iran in retaliation seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz leading into the Gulf. Gibraltar released the Iranian vessel on Aug. 15 after receiving formal written assurances from Tehran that the ship would not discharge its 2.1 million barrels of oil in Syria. However, shipping sources say the tanker is likely to try to conduct a ship-to-ship transfer with another vessel for part of its cargo after Iran said a sale had been concluded. Washington has warned any state against assisting the ship, saying it would consider that support for a terrorist organization, namely, Iran�s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted the tanker on Friday.

2464,Iran begins using new advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium,"Iran nuclear agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi has said the country has begun using new advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium - the latest step in reducing its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Kamalvandi added that 40 such centrifuges are now operational. ""All these steps are reversible if the other side fulfils its promises,"" Kamalvandi further said.",Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Saturday it was now capable of raising uranium enrichment past the 20% level and had launched advanced centrifuge machines in further breaches of commitments to limit its nuclear activity under a 2015 deal with world powers. �We have started lifting limitations on our Research and Development imposed by the deal ... It will include development of more rapid and advanced centrifuges,� Iranian nuclear agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told a televised news conference.  The 2015 pact curbed Iran�s disputed nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions, but has unraveled since the United States pulled out of it last year and acted to strangle Iran�s oil trade to push it into wider security concessions. Since May, Iran has begun to exceed limits on its nuclear capacity set by the pact in retaliation for U.S. pressure on Iran to negotiate restrictions on its ballistic missile program and support for proxy forces around the Middle East. Iran says its measures are reversible if European signatories to the accord manage to restore its access to foreign trade promised under the nuclear deal but blocked by the reimposition of U.S. sanctions. The deal capped the level of purity to which Iran can enrich uranium at 3.67 percent - suitable for civilian power generation and far below the 90% threshold of nuclear weapons grade. U.N. nuclear inspectors reported in July that Iran had cranked up enrichment to 4.5% purity. Kamalvandi said Tehran could now exceed the 20% level, a significant leap toward the critical 90%, �but right now there is no need for that�. He added, however: �European parties to the deal should know that there is not much time left, and if there is some action to be taken (to rescue the pact), it should be done quickly.�  The deal capped the number of machines that enrich uranium installed in Iran at some 6,000, down from around 19,000 before 2015. It allowed Iran to refine uranium only with slow, first-generation IR-1 centrifuges and to use small numbers of more advanced centrifuges solely for research, but without stockpiling enriched uranium, for a period of 10 years. But Kamalvandi said the Islamic Republic had started using an array of more advanced centrifuges as part of its gradual steps to downgrade its nuclear commitments.  �This includes IR-6 machines which have now been fed (uranium) gas. A chain of 20 IR-4 centrifuges has also been started. The IR-6 has also started as a chain of 20 since yesterday,� he said. �We will soon test our IR-8 centrifuge  cascade by injecting gas into 3 IR-8 machines.�  So far, Iran�s breaches of the deal�s limits on the pace and purity of enrichment have made little difference to the time it would need to accumulate enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it sought one. By limiting Iran�s enrichment capacity, the deal extended that time to roughly a year from a few months.   But advanced centrifuges can enrich at a much faster pace. �Machines developed by our own research and development will help accumulate reserves. This was done yesterday and announced to the IAEA today,� Kamalvandi said, referring to the U.N. nuclear watchdog. �Our stockpile is quickly increasing...� Kamalvandi stressed that IAEA inspectors retained full and regular access to Iran�s nuclear installations and again denied that Tehran seeking to develop nuclear weapons.  Acting IAEA chief Cornel Feruta was due in Tehran to meet Iranian officials on Sunday. France, Germany and Britain have struggled to save the deal by setting up a barter trade mechanism with Iran but it has yet to get off the ground and Tehran on Wednesday set another 60-day deadline for the Europeans. [L5N25V0DR] French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on Saturday that Paris would continue its efforts to bring Iran back into full compliance of the deal.

2479,"Bug found on Samsung, Huawei phones lets emails be 'stolen' via SMS","Cybersecurity researchers discovered a vulnerability in Samsung, Huawei, Sony and LG devices that could let hackers use custom SMS to intercept all email traffic on target devices. The attacks require different methods depending on the phone and available information, Check Point researchers said. They claimed that among the four manufacturers, devices from Samsung were the easiest to be attacked.",Engadget,"Bogus text messages aren't just being used to send you to malicious websites or crash your phone -- in some cases, they can hijack your emails.  Check Point Research has discovered a vulnerability in phones from Huawei, LG, Samsung and Sony that lets attackers use custom SMS to intercept all email traffic on target devices.  The attack uses the common Open Mobile Alliance version of over-the-air provisioning, a carrier technique for deploying settings to new phones, to access emails.  The attacks require different methods depending on the phone and available info (such as IMSI numbers and requesting PIN codes), but the result is the same: intruders trick users into compromising their phones through messages that pose as network settings changes.The problem stems in part from the way the provisioning works.  While it supports provisioning through relatively secure methods like PIN codes, it doesn't require them.  And it's usually down to individual vendors to decide how to implement this format rather than platform creators like Google, leading to inconsistent security.  Affected Samsung devices, for instance, don't need any authentication at all to fall victim.This variety also affects how secure your device is.  Some vendors have been better at addressing the problem than others.  Samsung fixed the flaw through a May update, while LG released its patch in July.  Huawei, however, said it wouldn't deliver interface fixes until the next wave of Mate and P-series phones.  You might have to wait weeks or months to get a solution, if you get one at all.  Sony, meanwhile, reportedly ""refused to acknowledge"" the flaw and would only say that it followed the Open Mobile Alliance spec.  Your Xperia might remain vulnerable unless there's a change of heart.This wouldn't be as much of an issue if it weren't for the scale of the issue and the relative ease of launching attacks.  Combined, the vendors represent more than half of all Android phones.  And all you need to instigate the attack is a GSM modem (or phone in modem mode) and basic software to compose the messages.  You can protect yourself by refusing these messages, but this could be a significant problem unless more Android vendors fall in line.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/06/sms-phishing-attack-android/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2524,Flow of undocumented migrants towards US fell by 56%: Mexico,"Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has said the flow of undocumented migrants heading towards the US border fell by 56% between May and August. Ebrard credited the reduction in flow of migrants to various measures taken by his government. In June, US President Donald Trump had threatened tariffs against Mexico if it did not curb migrant flow towards the US.",Reuters,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico does not expect the United States to threaten to put tariffs on its goods when it holds talks next week with U.S. officials about its efforts to curb migration from Central America, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Friday. Speaking at a regular government news conference alongside President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Ebrard said Mexico had reduced the flow of undocumented migrants crossing the country toward the U.S. border by 56% between May and August. At the end of May, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to put tariffs on all Mexican exports to the United States if Mexico did not significantly curb a recent surge in illegal immigration from Central America into the United States. In June, the two sides agreed to a 90-day window for Mexico to reduce migrant flows after it agreed to deploy thousands of security forces to its borders and began taking more asylum-seekers from the United States while their cases were being processed. That period ended this week, and Ebrard is to hold talks with U.S. officials on Tuesday to discuss Mexico�s efforts. Ebrard did not give numbers for apprehensions in August. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is expected to unveil its numbers for August in coming days. Citing preliminary figures, Politico reported that the U.S. Border Patrol arrested roughly 51,000 migrants in the month.  Mexico�s position would be that its strategy of positioning more than 25,000 National Guard militarized police along its borders and stepping up raids on people traffickers has been a success, Ebrard told the news conference. �I don�t expect there to be a tariff threat on Tuesday,� Ebrard said, pointing to the reduction in migrant flows. The minister reiterated that Mexico would not accept becoming a so-called safe third country, which would oblige migrants to seek asylum in Mexico rather than the United States. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Trump has lauded the Mexican government for curbing flows since the June deal. By July, apprehensions at the U.S. southern border had dropped by about a third, according to American data. Trump said this week that trend has continued. However, the United States is unlikely to remove the threat of tariffs totally or change its position that Mexico should become a safe third country. After meeting Ebrard in July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised Mexico�s efforts but said more needed to be done. August apprehensions are expected to remain higher than the same month a year ago. Ebrard said the Mexican government would keep investing in social programs in the south of Mexico as well as in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the three Central American countries from which most migrants depart. �This reduction of 56% in the flow of migrants is a result of diverse measures that the government has taken, in compliance with the Mexican migration law,� he said. Ebrard said there had been only seven official complaints about human rights violations by Mexican forces.

The incident came to light on Wednesday from Chennai.�The resident of Tirunelveli said that his daughter should complete her graduation before marrying anyone. While he wanted the 18-year-old to wait, she said that she was in love and wanted to get married to a 19-year-old boy.��The 18-year-old girl also said that she wanted to continue her studies but she did not want to live with her father. The order was given by a division bench comprising Justices S Vaidyyanathan and N Anand Venkatesh.

2538,Masked man enters Russian Election Commission chief's house; tasers her,"A masked man broke into the home of Ella Pamfilova, the head of Russia's Central Election Commission on Friday, and repeatedly tasered her, Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs said. The Ministry added that the man later fled. The attack happened two days before Russians vote in regional elections, including in Moscow.",Reuters,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A masked man broke into the home of the head of Russia�s Central Election Commission on Friday and repeatedly tried to taser her, the Interior Ministry said, two days before an election that has triggered street protests. Russian investigators said they would look into whether the attack was connected to her work. The commission head, Ella Pamfilova, said she suspected robbery was the motive.  Pamfilova and her colleagues, citing a technicality, refused to register several opposition candidates for the Moscow city election, leading to the biggest sustained protest movement in Russia since 2011-2013. �The masked intruder broke in through a window and got onto the house�s terrace and repeatedly tasered the home owner (Pamfilova) and then fled,� the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The house is situated outside Moscow.  An unnamed law enforcement source told the Interfax news agency that the taser device appeared not to have worked and the intruder had struck Pamfilova several times. Pamfilova, who took part in a conference in Moscow on Friday, appeared on state television looking shaken up.  She said she had hurt her finger and scratched her side while grappling with her assailant and then resisting him with a chair.  She said the intruder was lanky and appeared to be young and that she believed the most likely motive for the intrusion was an attempted robbery. Prominent opposition figure Alexei Navalny said on social media he thought the authorities had invented the attack on Pamfilova to distract attention from what he said was groundwork for electoral fraud in Moscow and other places where elections to local legislatures will be held. Pamfilova, 65, has been a focus for protesters� anger after barring opposition candidates from Sunday�s election for Moscow�s parliament. She said they had not collected enough genuine signatures to take part, which the excluded candidates said was a fabrication designed to stop them winning seats.  The Moscow vote is seen as a dry run for a national parliamentary election in 2021 with allies of Navalny seeing it as a chance to make political inroads in the capital. Navalny has called on his supporters to vote tactically to try to reduce the chances of the ruling United Russia party -  which supports President Vladimir Putin -  winning. PRO-PUTIN PARTY AT LOW EBB   The elections present a challenge for the authorities with the popularity of United Russia at its lowest in more than a decade, according to official pollsters. In Moscow, all of its candidates are running as independents, a tactic widely seen as aiming to prevent them from being damaged by the party�s waning support.  The party has served as a lightning rod for public anger over a government move last year to hike the retirement age, a deeply unpopular reform that compounded growing dismay over five years of falling real incomes.     The party�s approval rating stood at 32.6% last month, just shy of its lowest level in more than 13 years of polling data, according to state pollster VTsIOM.  Police detained over 2,000 people at this summer�s protests in Moscow, which began in mid-July, with courts jailing some of those who took part for up to four years. The Kremlin has shrugged off the protests� significance. At well over 60 percent, Putin�s personal approval rating is still high compared with many other world leaders, but is lower than it used to be.  Last year the 66-year-old former KGB intelligence officer won a landslide re-election and a new six-year term that runs until 2024.

2539,"China cuts banks' reserve ratios, frees up $126 billion for loans","China's central bank on Friday said it's cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, releasing a total $126.35 billion in liquidity. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has now cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) seven times since early 2018. China's economic growth slowed to a near 30-year low of 6.2% in the April-June quarter.",Reuters,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China�s central bank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the third time this year, releasing 900 billion yuan ($126.35 billion) in liquidity to shore up the flagging economy.  Analysts had expected China to announce more policy easing measures soon as the world�s second-largest economy comes under growing pressure from escalating U.S. tariffs and sluggish domestic demand. The People�s Bank of China (PBOC) said it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points (bps) for all banks, with an additional 100 bps cut for qualified city commercial banks. The RRR for large banks will be lowered to 13.0%. The PBOC has now slashed the ratio seven times since early 2018. The size of the latest move was at the upper end of market expectations, and the amount of funds released will be the largest so far in the current easing cycle. The broad-based cut, which will release 800 billion yuan in liquidity, is effective Sept. 16. The additional targeted cut will release 100 billion yuan, in two phases effective Oct. 15 and Nov. 15. �The move shows policymakers are increasingly worried but it�s far from enough to stabilize the economy,� said Larry Hu, head of Greater China economics at Macquarie Group in Hong Kong. �The key constraint is that everything is slowing down  � corporates are not willing to invest because of the trade war, a global slowdown, and weak infrastructure and property sector growth.� The latest move to spur bank lending followed a cabinet meeting on Sept. 4 that pledged to implement both broad and targeted cuts in the RRR �in a timely manner�.     The PBOC said it will maintain a prudent monetary policy and avoid flood-like stimulus, while increasing counter-cyclical adjustments and maintaining reasonable and abundant liquidity. Analysts say China�s economic growth has likely cooled further this quarter from a near 30-year low of 6.2% in April-June. Morgan Stanley says it is now tracking the lower end of the government�s full-year target range of around 6-6.5%. With Washington imposing new tariffs from Sept. 1, and threatening more measures from Oct. 1 and Dec. 15, some economists have recently cut their China growth estimates for next year to below 6%, which would breach Beijing�s longer-term  development goal. The central bank is also widely expected to cut one or more of its key policy interest rates in mid-September � for the first time in four years � as it works to reduce corporate funding costs. �I think it�s very likely they will cut the LPR (loan prime rate) by about 5-10 bps later this month. I also expect another RRR cut of 50 bps by the end of this year,� Macquarie�s Hu said. Despite a slew of support measures and policy easing since last year, China�s economy is still struggling to get back on firm footing. July�s data showed growth stumbled more sharply than expected as the intensifying trade war with the United States took a heavier toll, and August factory surveys pointed to continued weakness. Prior to the latest RRR cut, the central bank had pumped out 3.63 trillion yuan in net liquidity through reserve cuts since early 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on PBOC data and analyst estimates. The PBOC�s hefty injections have helped bring down companies� borrowing costs, which had jumped early last year as regulators clamped down on riskier types of financing and debt. But analysts have cautioned that some companies may be merely refinancing existing debt at better rates, rather than borrowing to fund fresh investments. Analysts say the problem is not a lack of credit � the PBOC has injected generous amounts of liquidity � but weakening business and consumer confidence as the trade war drags on. That has weighed on activity from manufacturing and investment to retail sales. In the latest escalation in the protracted trade dispute, the United States began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods on Sept. 1 - including footwear, smart watches and flat-panel televisions - and China began imposing new duties on U.S. crude. The next high-level trade talks are slated for early October, but a lasting peace seems more elusive than ever. The government has repeatedly said it will not resort to �flood-like� stimulus as it did in past economic downturns, which left a mountain of debt and sparked fears of property market bubbles. Instead, Beijing has relied more on fiscal stimulus such as increased infrastructure spending and tax cuts, though the boost has been milder than expected so far. The cabinet said on Wednesday China will allow local governments to issue special purpose bonds earlier than normal next year to help steady growth, and specified for the first time that about 20% of all special purpose bonds issued by every province could be used as project capital. Many local governments are facing increasing fiscal strains as tax cuts and the broader economic slowdown reduce revenues, hampering their ability to implement infrastructure projects. The OECD has estimated that China�s fiscal stimulus was equivalent to 4.25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, up from 2.94 percent last year.

2551,UK court rejects bid to stop PM Johnson's parliament suspension,"Londons High Court on Friday rejected a legal challenge against British PM Boris Johnsons suspension of parliament before Brexit. The court also said it could be taken to the Supreme Court for a final appeal. At the end of August, PM Johnson announced he would suspend parliament from mid-September to mid-October so the government could announce a new legislative programme.",Reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted lawfully when he ordered the suspension of parliament for five weeks before Brexit, London�s High Court ruled on Friday, but it allowed the the legal challenge to be taken to the Supreme Court.   Johnson announced at the end of August that he would suspend parliament from mid-September to mid-October, just before Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, so the government could announce a new legislative program.  But the move enraged opponents who accused him of seeking to silence parliament, and prompted campaigner Gina Miller to challenge the order, arguing that the House of Commons should be sitting during such a momentous time in the country�s history. Miller, who previously defeated the government in court over another Brexit issue two years ago, was backed by former Conservative Prime Minister John Major and some opposition politicians. �We feel strongly that parliamentary sovereignty is fundamental to the stability and future of our country and is therefore worth fighting to defend,� she said after the hearing.  �We are therefore pleased that the judges have given permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on the grounds that our case has merit.� The Supreme Court will hear the appeal on Sept. 17.  A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Johnson welcomed the ruling.  �We hope that those seeking to use the judiciary to frustrate the government take note of it and of the Court of Sessions ruling earlier this week (in Scotland) and withdraw their cases,� she said.  More than three years after Britons voted to leave the bloc in a 2016 referendum, Brexit remains up in the air, with options ranging from a last-minute divorce deal, a turbulent no-deal exit or abandoning the whole endeavor altogether. Miller�s lawyer, David Pannick, said comments from Johnson showed an important part of his reasoning for the prorogation, or suspension, was that parliament might say or do something that impeded the government�s Brexit plans. Johnson, who took office in July, has promised to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal. Government lawyer James Eadie had said the question of suspension was not a matter for the courts. He said Pannick�s central argument was that lawmakers would not be able to legislate over a no-deal Brexit but that events of recent days �indicate that that is just untenable� and rendered the proceedings �slightly pointless�. Lawmakers voted this week to force Johnson to seek a three-month delay to Brexit rather than leave without an agreement on Oct. 31, a move that could lead to an election.  Separate legal challenges to Johnson�s Brexit plans are also being heard in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Belfast, lawyers for local rights activist Raymond McCord argued Britain should not be allowed to leave the EU without a deal because it was not provided for in existing legislation and would be incompatible with Northern Ireland�s 1998 Good Friday peace accord. �To leave without a deal will cause chaos, economic misery and threaten the Northern Ireland peace process. It would be madness,� said Ronan Lavery, lawyer for McCord, whose son was killed during the three decades of violence the peace deal largely ended.

2558,Facebook announces $10-million contest to detect 'deepfakes',"Facebook, along with Microsoft, the Partnership on AI and several universities including Oxford and MIT, has announced the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) to help detect 'deepfake' videos. Facebook has committed $10 million to the program. It will commission researchers to produce realistic deepfakes to create a data set for testing detection tools that will participate in the contest.",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc is teaming up with Microsoft Corp, the Partnership on AI coalition and academics from several universities to launch a contest to better detect deepfakes, the company said in a blog post here on Thursday. The social media giant is putting $10 million into the �Deepfake Detection Challenge,� which aims to spur detection research. As part of the project, Facebook is commissioning researchers to produce realistic deepfakes to create a data set for testing detection tools. The company said the videos, which will be released in December, will feature paid actors and that no user data would be utilized. In the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, social platforms have been under pressure to tackle the threat of deepfakes, which use artificial intelligence to create hyper-realistic videos where a person appears to say or do something they did not. While there has not been a well-crafted deepfake video with major political consequences in the United States, the potential for manipulated video to cause turmoil was recently demonstrated by a �cheapfake� clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, manually slowed down to make her speech seem slurred. In August, the Democratic National Committee demonstrated the threat from deepfake videos by creating one of its own Chairman Tom Perez, to make the audience at hacker convention Def Con think the real Perez had Skyped into the conference. �They (deepfakes) lower the bar for an adversary that wants to create manipulated media,� said Matt Turek, who runs DARPA�s Media Forensics program. Some researchers are working on systems to authenticate a video or image at the point of capture through digital watermarking. But the rapid evolution of deepfake technology has created an arms race between deepfake creators and those trying to detect videos. �It�s a cat-and-mouse game. If I design a detection for deepfakes, I�m giving the attacker a new discriminator to test against,� said Siddharth Garg, an assistant professor of computer engineering at New York University�s Tandon School. The technology is also growing more accessible for less-skilled creators. Last week, a Chinese app called Zao that allows users to convincingly morph their faces onto movie stars rocketed to the top of the country�s app store, though it also faced a backlash over privacy concerns. Some online deepfake creators have also been tapping into this market for easy-to-make deepfakes. Machine-learning enthusiasts based in countries from Poland to Japan are making it easier for people to access custom deepfakes. They are uploading step-by-step YouTube tutorials, charging $30 for 50 words of an AI-powered Trump voice impersonation and running self-service websites that churn out deepfakes. The Deepfake Detection Challenge is not the first time that Facebook, which does not currently have a specific policy regarding deepfake videos, has funded academic research into the threat. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff demanded in July that Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc�s Google, which owns YouTube, share their plans to tackle deepfakes. Facebook said it is spending $7.5 million on teams at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Maryland and Cornell University in response to the threat. One of these teams, run by UC Berkeley Professor Hany Farid, is building �soft biometric models,� which map real politicians� facial quirks, from Senator Bernie Sanders� eyebrow jumps to Senator Elizabeth Warren�s head turns, to detect if a new video is fake. Facebook�s new contest, which builds on its ties with these researchers, will involve academics from Cornell Tech, MIT, University of Oxford, UC Berkeley, University of Maryland, College Park, and University at Albany-SUNY. In a statement on Thursday, Schiff called the contest a �promising step.� Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Lisa Shumaker",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-microsoft-deepfakes/facebook-microsoft-launch-contest-to-detect-deepfake-videos-idUSKCN1VQ2T5?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

This would mark an over 50% drop in the $47-billion valuation it gained in its last private funding round in January. Founded in 2010, the SoftBank-backed startup confidentially filed for IPO in April.",TechCrunch,"The�Wall Street Journal is reporting that the company formerly known as WeWork is considering slashing its valuation as it looks to woo public market investors.The company is reportedly considering a valuation of somewhere in the $20 billion range for its initial public offering, a figure that�s far less than the $47 billion valuation it received when it raised its last round of private funding.For SoftBank, no majority stake in WeWork as it scales down talks from a new $16 billion investment to $2 billionSince filing for its initial public offering earlier this summer, questions have swirled around the viability of The We Company (as it�s now known).According to the Journal, the company�s chief executive officer and co-founder Adam Neumann  flew to Tokyo last week to meet with SoftBank Group � one of the company�s largest investors.Neumann went to see if SoftBank would make another investment into the company � reportedly coming in as an anchor investor for the public offering and taking a big bite of the $3 billion to $4 billion the company was looking to raise. Neumann also reportedly discussed using SoftBank cash to delay the public offering until 2020.A few billion here and a few billion there, and soon you�re talking about real money.SoftBank has already balked at putting more cash into The We Company ahead of the public offering, and it�s not clear whether the company will step in as a white knight now. �What is clear is that We needs money and its long-term viability as a business is contingent on the infusion of massive amounts of cash.Indeed, the company has a $6 billion line of credit at stake, which would be pulled if the public offering underperforms.If the company fails to hit the $3 billion mark in its public offering, then the credit line promised from the big banks that are underwriting the public offering goes away. That would be a pretty devastating turn of events for a company that�s currently racking up losses in the billions of dollars.All of this comes during a shuffling of deck chairs designed to make the company look somewhat better to institutional investors and the public.

2566,China supports withdrawal of extradition bill: Hong Kong leader,"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Thursday said that China ""understands, respects and supports"" her government's move to formally withdraw an extradition bill. The bill, that had triggered months of anti-government protests, was withdrawn on Wednesday. ""We must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions,"" Lam further said.",Reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Thursday that China �understands, respects and supports� her government�s move to formally withdraw an extradition bill, part of measures she hoped would help the city �move forward� from months of unrest. In a press conference, Lam was repeatedly questioned on why it took her so long to withdraw the bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China despite increasingly violent protests, but she skirted the questions. �It is not exactly correct to describe this as a change of mind,� she said. She added that full withdrawal of the bill was a decision made by her government with Beijing�s backing. �Throughout the whole process, the Central People�s Government took the position that they understood why we have to do it. They respect my view, and they support me all the way,� said Lam, dressed in a cream suit and looking less tense than a televised appearance the day before. She withdrew the bill, which has plunged the Chinese territory into its worst political crisis in decades, on Wednesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI surged more than 4% to a one-month high ahead of the announcement. On Thursday, the market was up 0.4% by midday.    Lam also announced other measures including opening a platform for dialogue with society to try to address other deep-rooted economic, social and political problems, including housing and mobility for young people, that she said were contributing to the current impasse. �We must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions,� she said. The withdrawal of the bill was one of the pro-democracy protesters� five demands, although many demonstrators and lawmakers said the move was too little, too late. The four other demands are: retraction of the word �riot� to describe rallies, release of all demonstrators, an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders. Demonstrators were still calling for all demands to be met, with many placing emphasis on the independent inquiry. Lam said on Thursday that the independent police complaints council was credible enough to address the probe. �We have all suffered from a humanitarian disaster caused by the government and police force,� said Wong, one of around 100 medical students protesting at Hong Kong University. Clad in gas masks, they formed a human chain shouting �Five demands, indispensable.� �Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time.�  Further protests are planned including on Saturday another �stress test� at the airport, which was targeted by protesters on Sunday leading to clashes with police on approach roads and in the nearby new town of Tung Chung. The official China Daily said the withdrawal of the bill was an olive branch that leaves demonstrators with no excuse to continue the violence. The announcement came after Reuters reports on Friday and Monday revealed that Beijing had thwarted Lam�s earlier proposals to withdraw the bill and that she had said privately that she would resign if she could, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters. Lam leaves for China�s Guangxi province on Thursday afternoon.  Skirmishes broke out in some districts including the working class Po Lam late on Wednesday after Lam�s announcement, which came after a weekend of some of the most violent protests the city has seen in the past three months.  Police said a suspected petrol bomb was hurled at a luxury property in Kowloon district in the early hours of Thursday and the suspects fled on a motorbike. Local newspaper Apple Daily said the house belonged to Jimmy Lai, the newspaper�s owner, who was in the property at the time. Pro-democracy publishing tycoon Lai is an outspoken critic of Beijing. The bill was seen as the latest example of what many residents see as ever-tighter control by Beijing, despite the promise of autonomy. The former British colony was handed back to China in 1997 under a �one country, two systems� administration which gave the city of more than 7 million people more freedoms than mainland cities, such as an independent judiciary - prompting the anger over the extradition bill. The protests are the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping�s rule since he took power in 2012. China denies meddling in Hong Kong�s affairs and accuses Western countries of fueling the unrest. Images of some of the fiercest clashes have been beamed live on television screens across the world, sending jitters across the international business community and leading to a large drop in tourism. The Hong Kong government took out a full-page advertisement in the Australian Financial Review on Thursday saying it is �determined to achieve a peaceful, rational and reasonable resolution� and is resolutely committed to �one country, two systems�. It ends the ad by saying: �We will no doubt bounce back. We always do.� More than 1,100 people have been arrested since the violence escalated in June and Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade.

2568,Fitch downgrades Hong Kong for first time since 1995 after protests,"Fitch Ratings has downgraded Hong Kong's long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating for the first time since 1995 following months of protests in the city. The rating was lowered to AA from AA+ with a negative outlook. Disagreeing with Fitch's downgrade, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said, ""The chaos over the past few months has not weakened...the rule of law.""",Reuters,"(Reuters) - Global credit rating agency Fitch Ratings on Friday downgraded Hong Kong�s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to �AA� from �AA+� following months of unrest and protests in the Asian financial hub.  Hong Kong�s rating outlook is negative, Fitch Ratings said in its statement. The massive, and sometimes violent protests have roiled the financial centre as thousands chafe at a perceived erosion of freedoms and autonomy under Chinese rule. Fitch said it expects the �one country, two systems� framework to remain intact, but added that public discontent is likely to persist despite recent concessions to certain demands by protesters. The rating downgrade comes as Hong Kong is bracing for more demonstrations this weekend, with protesters threatening to disrupt transport links to the airport, after embattled leader Carrie Lam�s withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill failed to appease some activists. The anti-government protests began in March amid fears that Beijing is eroding the autonomy granted to Hong Kong when it was handed back to China in 1997. China denied the charge of meddling and said Hong Kong is an internal affair. The rating agency said it expects Hong Kong�s financial buffers to remain intact, although it anticipates that the region�s revenue will underperform budget forecast.

2575,There's got to be politicians who care about air quality: Tharoor,"Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday said that discussion on air quality is very limited in the Parliament because it is not a determinant of votes in India.

2578,North Korea tells UN to cut international aid staff: Reports,"North Korea has reportedly told the United Nations to cut the number of international staff it deploys in the country because the world body's programmes have failed. ""UN supported programmes failed to bring the results as desired due to the politicisation of UN assistance by hostile forces,"" a North Korean official wrote to a top UN official.",Reuters,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea has told the United Nations to cut the number of international staff it deploys in the country because the world body�s programs have failed �due to the politicization of U.N. assistance by hostile forces,� according to a letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The United Nations estimates 10.3 million people - almost half the country�s population - are in need and some 41 percent of North Koreans are undernourished, while Pyongyang said in February it was facing a food shortfall this year and had to halve rations, blaming drought, floods and sanctions. �U.N. supported programs failed to bring the results as desired due to the politicization of U.N. assistance by hostile forces,� Kim Chang Min, secretary general for North Korea�s National Coordinating Committee for the United Nations, wrote to the top U.N. official posted in the country.  In the Aug. 21 letter, Kim said the number of international staff should be cut by the end of the year.   North Korea wants the number of international staff with the U.N. Development Programme to be cut to one or two from six, the World Health Organization to four from six and the U.N. Children�s Fund (UNICEF) to cut its 13 staff by one or two. Kim said the number of international staff with the World Food Programme should be reduced �according to the amount of food aid to be provided� once the agency and North Korean agree how to implement a plan for 2019 to 2021. There was also no need for a humanitarian aid coordination officer, Kim wrote, adding that U.N. aid officials could instead �visit as and when required.�  The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. �Historically there�s been a critical lack of international expertise and oversight and capacity to monitor the use of the assistance that is provided,� said a U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  �We�re deeply surprised by this turn of events in part because this is when the needs have grown and the U.N. has been trying to mobilize support to scale up assistance in country,� the diplomat said.  The move comes amid stalled talks between the United States and North Korea aimed at dismantling Pyongyang�s nuclear and missile programs. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for those programs. �The North Korean government�s decisions are only hurting the North Korean people,� said a second U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  �This is coming at a time where both Russia and China are pushing a false narrative that sanctions are causing the humanitarian problems in North Korea and the only way to solve that is to give North Korea sanctions relief,� the diplomat said.  Russia�s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters on Tuesday that unilateral sanctions imposed on North Korea by other countries and some strict interpretations of U.N. sanctions were hindering humanitarian work.  �The population of North Korea should not suffer under those sanctions that have been imposed illegitimately,� he said.

2620,H&M halts leather purchases from Brazil due to 'severe' Amazon fires,"Fashion retailer H&M has stopped purchasing leather from Brazil for the time being due to ""severe"" fires in Amazon rainforest. This comes amid concerns that Brazil's cattle industry contributed to deforestation of Amazon rainforest. ""The ban will be active until there are credible assurance systems in place to verify that the leather does not contribute to environmental harm,"" H&M said.",Reuters,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M, the world�s second-biggest fashion retailer, said on Thursday it had stopped purchasing leather from Brazil for the time being due to environmental concerns highlighted by Amazon wildfires.  Sweden-based H&M follows VF Corp, owner of shoe and clothing brands including Timberland, Vans and North Face, which made a similar announcement last week in response to the fires. Thousands of fires tearing through the Amazon have spawned an international crisis for Brazil, with public protests and world leaders voicing concern that the government of Jair Bolsonaro is doing too little to protect the world�s largest tropical rainforest. Fears have been growing in Brazil that companies would step back from the country amid adverse publicity surrounding the burning forest and the prospect of international sanctions.  �Due to the severe fires in the Brazilian part of the Amazon rainforest, and the connections to cattle production, we have decided to place a temporary ban on leather from Brazil,� H&M said in an emailed statement.  �The ban will be active until there are credible assurance systems in place to verify that the leather does not contribute to environmental harm in the Amazon,� it said.  Brazil�s space research agency INPE says a surge this year in fires is the worst since 2010.  An H&M spokeswoman said the vast majority of the group�s leather originates from Europe and only a very small part from Brazil. According to the Center for the Brazilian Tanning Industry, the main leather trade group in Brazil, the country exported $1.44 billion of bovine leather in 2018. Its largest export markets were the United States, China and Italy.

2621,Western firms didn't see e-commerce gorilla coming: Reliance Brands CEO,"Reliance Brands CEO Darshan Mehta has said that Western companies ""overbuilt"" their store estates and did not see the ""e-commerce gorilla"" coming. ""Look around and you'll always find many of them up for sale, whether it be in New York, London or Milan,"" he added. The company, which recently bought Hamleys, is looking to buy fashion and child-focused retailers abroad.",Reuters,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India�s Reliance Industries Ltd is looking to buy fashion and child-focused retailers abroad and partner with global sports and beauty brands as part of its expansion into consumer markets, a top executive told Reuters. Under Asia�s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries is pivoting from an oil-led conglomerate into a more consumer-facing company, selling everything from handbags to broadband to try to tap into Indians� rising disposable incomes.   Reliance Brands already runs high-end stores in India with some 40 foreign partners, including British label Burberry, shoemaker Steve Madden and New York-based Iconix Brand Group Inc, through joint ventures and franchises. It also wrapped up its first international acquisition in May, buying Hamleys here the world's oldest toy retailer, for $88.5 million. And it is not planning to stop there. �The Hamleys acquisition ... has already whetted our appetite,� Reliance Brands CEO Darshan Mehta said in an interview in India�s financial capital Mumbai.  �Internationally,�much�of brick and mortar retail is in a lot of pain,� he added at the Reliance Brands office plastered with photographs of models advertising its breadth of brands. �No wonder -�what may have once been available for 100 is now available for 50.� Western companies �over built� their store estates and did not see the �e-commerce gorilla� coming, Mehta said. �Look around and you will always find many of them up for sale, whether it be in New York, London or Milan.� Mehta declined to give details on talks. He said Reliance had no timeline and often took years to strike deals.  �You can�t hurry love,� he said. Reliance is already India�s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in terms of revenue and number of stores. And Ambani, whom Forbes says is the world�s 13th richest man, is also scaling up his grocery and wholesale businesses. Reliance Brands� products are available at 788 locations spread across exclusive brand outlets, shopping malls and airports. The company is planning to open around 120 stores in India in the fiscal year to March 2020, Mehta said.  The company is also seeking to partner with brands in two segments where it so far does not have a presence: beauty and athletic lifestyle wear. Multi-brand sports, wellness and fitness are the categories of interest for the company, Mehta said, adding women�s and men�s beauty products were also the target areas. However, Reliance Brands - which Mehta said chiefly targets around 50 million affluent Indians - still remains a small part of the Reliance conglomerate, which made a net profit of $5.5 billion on $87 billion of revenue in the year ended March 2019.

Laxman also talked about Sharma's maiden Test fifty, saying, he must have felt delighted. The 31-year-old took 11 wickets in the two-match series.",Cricket Country,"Former India batsman VVS Laxman is impressed watching Ishant Sharma develop into the leader of the Indian Test bowling line-up and maintain an uncanny level of consistency over the years. Ishant picked up 13 wickets in the two-Test series against West Indies, including a five-wicket-haul in the first Test and capped it with a maiden Test fifty as India secured a 2-0 clean sweep.READ � Don�t want to think about entering 100 Test milestone: Ishant SharmaLaxman, Ishant�s former teammate is thrilled to see Ishant, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah form a formidable pace attack for India.�While he is the leader of the attack, it was wonderful to see Ishant maintain his consistency of the last few years, as well as put a price on his wicket. I am sure he must have been as delighted with his maiden half-century as a five-wicket haul. He and Shami are experienced pros, and form alongside Bumrah a pace attack as good as, if not better than, any going around in world cricket.� Laxman wrote in Thursday�s column for Times of India.READ � Centurion Vihari dedicates maiden Test century to late fatherBesides Ishant, Laxman had wonderful things to say about Hanuma Vihari and Bumrah. Batting at No. 6, Vihari announced himself scoring 298 runs including two half-centuries and a hundred, whereas Bumrah rattled West Indies with two five-wicket-hauls including a hat-trick, becoming only the third Indian Test bowler to the landmark.�There is so much to admire about the brand of cricket India played, and no one exemplified it better than Hanuma Vihari with the bat and Jasprit Bumrah with the ball. I have followed Vihari�s career closely. I am convinced the years of first-class cricket have instilled the temperament and mindset to score runs consistently in Test cricket,� Laxman said.�Speaking from experience, I can say that batting at No. 6 is not an easy task. But Vihari has been at home, enhancing his reputation as a Test batsman with every outing. He is very calm and mature at the crease, looks to dominate the spinners with exemplary use of the feet, and is assured against fast bowling. I look forward to greater things from him.�Bumrah, of course, has been a sight to behold for some time now. He is in complete command of his craft and you can actually see him develop and improve each day.�That said, Laxman also addressed the few lingering issues such as KL Rahul�s inability to covert starts and Cheteshwar Pujara�s rare failure in a Test series. Rahul scored 44 and 38 in Antigua and looked solid, but was dismissed cheaply in both innings in Jamaica. Pujara, on the other hand, managed just 60 in four innings, a stark contrast to the Border-Gavaskar series, where India�s No. 3 sparkled with 521 runs.�There were lots of positives for India, but question marks hang over the batting. Cheteshwar Pujara must be disappointed at a modest start to a new season, but the greater concern is over KL Rahul. His ability is never under question, and he is no longer a newcomer to Test cricket. He has got numerous opportunities, but he has often flattered to deceive. India will look for more from him and Rishabh Pant, both with the bat and the gloves, in future,� Laxman said.",https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/wonderful-to-see-ishant-sharma-maintain-such-level-of-consistency-vvs-laxman-888043?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The blast destroyed cars and shops near the headquarters of Afghanistan's NATO office and the US embassy. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack while the insurgents and the US have been negotiating a peace deal.",Reuters,"KABUL (Reuters) - A Taliban suicide blast in the center of Kabul killed at least 10 civilians and two NATO soldiers on Thursday, destroying cars and shops in an area near the headquarters of Afghanistan�s international military force and the U.S. embassy. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack even as the insurgents and U.S. officials have been negotiating a deal on a U.S. troop withdrawal in exchange for Taliban security guarantees. �At least 10 civilians have been killed and 42 injured were taken to hospitals,� said Nasrat Rahimi, a spokesman for the interior ministry. The NATO-led Resolute Support mission said in a statement a Romanian and a U.S. member of the force were killed in action in Kabul. It did not provide any more details. A senior Afghan interior ministry official said the two soldiers were killed in the suicide bomb attack and their vehicle was the main target. The death of the U.S. service member brings the number of American troops killed in Afghanistan this year to 16, including three last month. Several cars and small shops were torn apart by the blast at a checkpoint on a road near the NATO office and U.S. embassy. Police cordoned off the area. Witnesses said the suicide bomber blew himself up as many people were standing nearby or crossing the road.  Besmellah Ahmadi said he suffered minor wounds and sought shelter in a shop. �My car windows were shattered. People rushed to get me out,� he told Reuters. There has been no let-up in violence in Afghanistan even though both the Taliban and U.S. officials have reported progress in negotiations aimed at securing a deal on U.S. withdrawal. President Ashraf Ghani accepted the resignation of the head of Afghanistan�s powerful security agency NDS on Thursday over a separate incident overnight in the eastern city of Jalalabad. The NDS had said it killed four men suspected of ties to Islamic State, but some local officials said four brothers with no ties to militants had been killed. Rahimi, the interior ministry spokesman, said government forces killed a senior Taliban commander, more than 20 fighters and the man the hardline insurgent group planned to impose as regional governor, in another clash on Thursday in central Maidan Wardak province. And in the eastern province of Loghar, Taliban fighters said they detonated a car bomb near a security meeting. Government officials said four civilians were killed. On Monday, a Taliban suicide truck bomber attacked a compound used by international organizations in Kabul, killing at least 16 people and wounding more than 100. A Romanian was among those killed and one was seriously wounded in the attack on the compound, known as the Green Village. The Taliban now controls more territory than it has since 2001, when the United States launched a military operation against the group for harboring the al Qaeda militants responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The U.S. negotiator for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said this week the two sides had drawn up a draft framework agreement under which U.S. troops would leave five military bases within 135 days of the signing of the pact. The U.S. general overseeing American forces in the region, General Kenneth McKenzie, declined to comment on the negotiations with the Taliban. But he saw a continuing need for military pressure on al Qaeda and Islamic State militants in the region going forward, regardless of the outcome of the talks. �We can explore what that�s going to look like. It could be a broad variety of things. But I don�t think you can leave it uncontested,� McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told reporters during a trip to Jordan. There are some 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Despite ending their combat role in 2014, an estimated 20,000 U.S. and NATO troops remain in the country to train, advise and assist Afghan forces. Khalilzad is expected to meet Afghan and NATO officials to explain the draft agreement, which must still be approved by President Donald Trump before it can be signed. Khalilzad, a veteran Afghan-born U.S. diplomat, has shared details of the draft with President Ghani, and sought his opinion before firming up an agreement that could bring an end to America�s longest war. But Ghani�s government is seeking clarification from the United States on the draft agreement. �The world must break its silence,� Ghani�s spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said on Twitter, referring to what some people in Afghanistan see as a recent U.S. reluctance to criticize the Taliban, through fear of derailing the talks. The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, John Bass, condemned the attack: �It is far past time for these senseless attacks to end,� he said on Twitter. He did not refer to the Taliban. Ghani condemned what he called a cowardly attack on civilians by the Taliban.  �They have shamelessly claimed responsibility and are celebrating the deaths of innocent lives,� he said on Twitter. Ghani said he had accepted the resignation of the NDS chief, Mohammed Masoom Stanekzai, in response to the Jalalabad killings. Provincial officials and residents said the NDS forces had killed four brothers, one of whom was a working as a secretary for a Senate official. �As a responsible state we have zero tolerance for civilian casualties,� Ghani said in a tweet, adding that he had ordered an independent probe into the killings.  The United Nations in a report released in July said that at least 3,812 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in the first half of 2019.

Remembering the fond memories, Virat recalled his first meeting with Anushka as he spoke to the American television sports reporter, Graham Bensinger and accepted being a nervous wreck on seeing her.The cricketer recalled that the two met for the first time as they shot together for a shampoo commercial. Virat, being away from the world of acting was nervous as learned that Anushka Sharma was going to feature in the same advertisement alongside him. He chuckled as he remembered going jittery and cracking a joke in front of Anushka as he was speechless on seeing her. In an attempt to cover his nervousness with humour, Virat remarked the actress on her height but pulled a complete scared silly as his joke failed to do any charm.A nervous Virat stood there embarrassed, while Anushka looked extremely confident and professional. The shoot went across for 3 days and slowly the two began to hit off well. Despite being in two different worlds professionally, the timeline and success graph for both of them was quite similar and belonging to similar family backgrounds, turned out to be an advantage for their budding friendship.

Markande scored an unbeaten 76 in the first innings.",CricTracker,"All eyes were on Ishan Kishan ahead of the Duleep Trophy final clash between India Green and India Red that kicked off at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Wednesday. The 21-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman is seen as one of India�s promises in the post-Mahendra Singh Dhoni era and the observers remained interested in seeing how the script unfolds for him in the match. Kishan had a busy day and it was mostly verbal.India Green captain Faiz Fazal won the toss and elected to bat first. However, his team had a poor first day which was also disrupted by the elements. In 49 overs that took place during the day, India Green reached 147 but lost eight wickets. Green�s No.8 batsman Mayank Markande was the highest scorer with 32 and he was still at the crease when the bails were withdrawn. And Kishan had a duel with him which was the high point of the day.AdvertisementMarkande came out to bat with Green reeling at 99 for 6 in the 34th over. And soon after, Kishan started targeting him from behind the stumps by talking loudly with the fielders. The stump microphone caught his words that left the commentators in splits.�His shots won�t go that far. The ball will come before you,� Kishan was heard telling the fielders standing in deep positions as left-arm spinner Aditya Sarwate came into bowl at Markande the final over of the day. Even the slip fielder was seen having a laugh over Kishan�s words as did Markande. �Khelne ka mann nahi hai bhai ko,� Kishan added.Kishan was even heard taunting the batsman, �The gentleman is in no mood to play today.� He even meant that the batsman doesn�t have enough power to clear the boundaries. �He is trying to provoke the batsman,� one of the commentators said, adding that perhaps this is called sledging.India Red bowlers came up with a strong performance on Day 1 with spearhead Jaydev Unadkat taking 4 wickets for 58 runs. Four other bowlers took a wicket each. It will be interesting to see how early the Red can bowl out the Green and try for a comprehensive lead.

He added Moscow would not deploy them unless the US did so first. The US pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty last month.,Reuters,"VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would produce missiles that were banned under a landmark Cold-War era nuclear pact that ended last month, but that Moscow would not deploy them unless the United States did so first.  Speaking at an economic forum in Russia�s Far East, Putin said Moscow had urged the United States to de-escalate a spiraling arms race between the former Cold War foes, but that Washington had not responded.  The Russian leader said he was concerned by U.S. talk of deploying missiles in Japan and South Korea, a deployment he said would cover parts of Russian territory.   Tensions over nuclear arms control have been rising after Washington formally pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) pact last month accusing Russia of violating it, allegations Moscow denied.  Last month the United States tested a conventionally-configured cruise missile that hit a target more than 500 km  away, a test that would have been prohibited under the INF.  The pact banned land-based missiles with a range of 310-3,400 miles, reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike at short notice. �...Of course we will produce such missiles,� Putin told an economic forum in the Russian city of Vladivostok. He repeated a pledge by Moscow not to deploy any new missiles unless the United States does so first.          �We are not happy about the fact that the head of the Pentagon said that the United States intends to deploy them in Japan and South Korea, this saddens us and is a cause for certain concern,� Putin said.  Putin said he offered U.S. President Donald Trump in a recent phone call the chance to buy one of the hypersonic nuclear weapons Moscow is developing. He said Trump spurned the offer and replied that Washington was making its own. Putin said he feared that an arms race could spread into space and that Washington could develop a new space weapon.

Under the deal, the US would withdraw 5,400 of its troops from Afghanistan within 135 days. ""If and when there is an agreement that is approved by all parties... he will sign it,"" State Department spokesperson said.",ANI,"Washington DC [USA], Sep 5 (ANI): United States Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has declined to sign an agreement reached ""in principle"" between the US and Taliban under which Washington would withdraw about 5400 of its troops from Afghanistan, TIME Magazine has exclusively reported, citing senior US, Afghan and European officials.The agreement was reached upon between the US and Taliban negotiators during the ninth round of talks held in this regard in Qatar's capital city of Doha. Under the agreement, the US would withdraw the said number of troops from five of its bases in Afghanistan within 135 days.Officials familiar with discussions told TIME that the deal does not ensure several crucial things, such as the survival of pro-US government in Kabul, guaranteeing the continued presence of US counterterrorism forces to battle al-Qaeda or an end to fighting in Afghanistan.""No one speaks with certainty. None,"" an Afghan official taking part in briefings on the deal with Washington's peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said. ""It is all based on hope. There is no trust. There is no history of trust. There is no evidence of honesty and sincerity from the Taliban,"" and intercepted communications ""show that they think they have fooled the US while the US believes that should the Taliban cheat, they will pay a hefty price.""The uncertainty over these crucial points may explain why Pompeo declined to sign the agreement. Pompeo's office had declined to comment on this before the publication of TIME's story.However, after the story was published, Pompeo said through a spokesperson that he might sign ""if and when there is an agreement that is approved by all parties, including President Trump"".""There is no agreement to sign yet. If and when there is an agreement that is approved by all parties, including President Trump and if the Secretary is the appropriate signatory, he will sign it,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus emailed TIME Wednesday evening.Taliban and the US have held nine rounds of peace talks in the past ten months over the agreement which is broadly centred around the withdrawal of latter's troops in exchange for the guarantee by the former that the Afghan soil, particularly areas under the group's control, would not become a platform for transnational terrorism. In addition, the agreement would pave the way for the initiation of intra-Afghan peace talks.The US currently has about 14,000 service members in Afghanistan, and the move would reduce troop levels to one of the lowest points in the history of the 18-year long war. The figure had swelled to nearly 100,000 at the highest mark in 2011 and dipped to 8,300 in 2017, according to USA Today.

2675,India hikes import tax on Malaysian refined palm oil to 50%,India has raised the tax on Malaysian refined palm oil to 50% from 45% for six months to curb imports and boost local refining. India currently imposes a 40% import tax on crude palm oil and 50% on refined palm oil. But shipments of refined palm oil from Malaysia were taxed at 45% since January under an agreement with Malaysia.,Reuters,"(Repeats item issued late Wednesday) * Duty gap between crude and refined palm oil narrows to 5% * Refined palm oil imports could fall from Oct-importer * Indonesia could gain market share in India-dealer By Rajendra Jadhav and Nidhi Verma MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Sept 4 (Reuters) - India has raised the tax on refined palm oil from Malaysia to 50% from 45% for six months to curb imports and boost local refining. The world�s biggest edible oil importer currently imposes a 40% import tax on crude palm oil and 50% on refined palm oils. But since January, shipments of refined palm oils from Malaysia have been taxed at 45%, under an agreement with Malaysia. This reduced the effective difference in duty between crude palm oil and refined palm oil from Malaysia for Indian refiners to 5.5% from 11%, making overseas buying of refined palm more lucrative. That led to a 727% surge in Malaysia�s refined palm exports to India in the first half of 2019 to 1.57 million tonnes compared with the same period a year before, according to data compiled by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Mumbai-based trade body the Solvent Extractors� Association of India said rising shipments of refined palm oil hit local refiners and filed an application with the Directorate General of Trade Remedies for an investigation. The watchdog last week recommended raising the import tax on refined products. India said the 50% duty on refined products would be applicable until March 2, 2020. The hike in duty on refined palm oil will prompt Indian buyers to switch to crude palm oil, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of the Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based vegetable oil importer. �Importing refined palm oil is no longer attractive. From October imports of CPO could rise and refined palm will go down,� he said. India imports palm oil mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia. Indonesia traditionally claimed two-thirds of India�s palm oil imports, but in the first half of 2019 Malaysia surpassed Indonesia as biggest supplier to India due to the duty advantage. �Indonesia is likely to regain market share again in coming months. It provides crude palm oil more competitively than Malaysia,� said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. Palm oil accounts for two-thirds of India�s vegetable oil imports. New Delhi also imports soyoil from Argentina and Brazil and sunflower oil from Ukraine and Russia.

The U.S. president in the past has said he would be open to including Huawei in talks to reach a trade deal with Beijing. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this summer agreed the United States would ease restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and China would make unspecified purchases of U.S. farm products.

Archer did not respond to the comments.",Times Now,"Two Australian fans were thrown out of the Old Trafford in Manchester on Wednesday for shouting��foul and abusive� language towards English speedster Jofra Archer during the ongoing fourth Ashes 2019 Test. The fans were sitting in the stands below�the England dressing room at the Brian Stathan End and shouted abuses and slangs towards Archer while he was fielding at the boundary line during the Australian innings.The crowd in England has been hostile towards the Australian team given their long, intense-rivalry. However, it was the complete opposite during the 4th Ashes 2019 Test when the Aussie fans started hurling abuses towards Archer. The pair shouted insults towards Archer and were loud enough to annoy other supporters sitting close.According to a report, Archer was left angry after the fans started shouting �Jofra show us your passport� and other references to his Barbados heritage. Other supports sitting beside the two men complained to the stewards before the matter escalated and police interfered.A Lancashire spokesman confirmed that two supporters were ejected from the Old Trafford while insisting the club has a zero-tolerance policy towards abusive behaviour.

However, during the quadrennial event, no trouble was reported from the venue during the England versus Australia encounter. The hostility and booing continued as England and Australia took to the field for the Ashes 2019 with Smith and Warner subjected to constant booing by the crowd. However, the Aussie duo has been extremely friendly with the crowd and believes in making the bat do the talking.While Warner stole thunders during the quadrennial event, Smith has been garnering plaudits from all corners of the world during Ashes 2019. Warner finished as second-highest run-getter in the World Cup while Smith is leading the run-scoring charts in Ashes.Recently, Smith retained his throne at the top of ICC�s Test batting charts after Indian captain Virat Kohli had displaced him from the top spot when the former Aussie skipper was facing a year-long ban due to his involvement in the infamous sandpaper gate incident in 2018.Booing and jeering are part and parcel of the game but abusive language towards someone�s heritage is something which any sport don�t deserve to get from the fans, especially when cricket is growing rapidly in England.�",https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/ashes-2019-two-australian-fans-thrown-out-of-old-trafford-after-abusive-rant-towards-jofra-archer/482861?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

The campaign (ahead of coming state elections) should focus on our (government's) performance,"" the editorial said.The NCP was born out of a split (in the Congress) and now the breakaway group was splintering, it said.""Political winds change. Parties are formed, they decline. But no party ever vanishes from the political horizon. Everybody in politics should remember this,"" it said.However, the situation within the NCP indicated that Pawar's grip on Maharashtra politics had weakened, it said.""In his heyday, Pawar too practiced the politics of breaking up other parties,"" it added.",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/sep/05/no-party-becomes-completely-extinct-shiv-sena-on-bjps-jibes-at-ncp-2029276.html?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2705,Grocery delivery startup Milkbasket may raise $50 mn: Report,"Gurugram-based grocery delivery startup Milkbasket is reportedly in advanced-stage talks with private equity funds to raise over $50 million. As per reports, the Series C round will likely close within the coming two months. Founded in 2015 by Anant Goel, Ashish Goel, Anurag Jain and Yatish Talvadia, the startup has reportedly raised $26 million till now.",TechCrunch,"Milkbasket, a Gurugram-based micro-delivery startup, is in talks to close a new financing round as it looks to expand its footprint in the milk, grocery, fruit and vegetable delivery market that has attracted the attention of many in recent months, including Amazon India.The four-year-old startup is in advanced stages of talks with private equity funds to raise more than $50 million, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The round, Series C, is likely to close within the next two months, they said. A spokesperson of Milkbasket,  which has raised $26 million to date, declined to comment.Milkbasket, which operates in Bangalore, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad and Hyderabad, allows users to order their daily supplies until midnight and delivers it in the early morning hours. It has also started a subscription service for users who need the same set of items delivered to them everyday.In a recent interview�with Indian newspaper Economic Times (paywalled), the startup executives said they are not trying to get items instantly to customers but focus on recurring supplies that need to reach people�s doorsteps at certain hours of the day, thereby�mimicking how a traditional milkman and paperboy operate to lower delivery costs.The startup, which focused on just delivering milk in its early years, is increasingly exploring new categories to enter, and might soon begin delivering prescribed medicine in some cities, one of the people said. Milk delivery is now a small portion of the startup�s business.It competes with BigBasket and Grofers,  both of which are heavily backed and locked in a fierce battle to gain market share. Many more startups are entering micro-delivery territory. Naspers and Tencent-backed Swiggy launched a new service called �Go� yesterday that will enable people in Bangalore to have anything delivered to them.Google-backed Dunzo  is also increasingly gaining popularity and slowly expanding to more cities across India. FreshToHome, a startup that delivers meat and vegetables, recently started to offer milk delivery in select places.Last month, Amazon launched Fresh to offer fresh fruits and vegetables in parts of Bangalore. The company is increasingly expanding its fulfillment centers across the nation to offer its customers a wider selection of items, Siddharth Nambiar, director of Prime Now in India, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.The foods and grocery market is growing in India. According to some estimates, it will reach $869 billion in sales in 2023, with digital-based services seen as an important vector for growth.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/milkbasket-series-c/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2729,Trump shows Hurricane Dorian map apparently altered by marker pen,US President Donald Trump on Wednesday showed a map of Hurricane Dorian's projected path that appeared to have been altered with a marker pen. A black loop was extended on the map to show a risk that Hurricane Dorian could move from Florida to Alabama. Hurricane Dorian was never projected to hit Alabama.,Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump showed a map of Hurricane Dorian�s projected path on Wednesday that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen to include the state of Alabama, which was never in harm�s way.  In a White House video released on Wednesday Trump points to an official weather chart dated Aug. 29 showing the states that could be hit in what the National Hurricane Center calls the �cone of uncertainty.� A curved line had been added to the cone on the chart to show a risk that Dorian could move from Florida to Alabama. �It was going to hit not only Florida, but Georgia, it could have, it was going towards the Gulf, that was what we, what was originally projected...,� Trump says in the video. Dorian was never projected to be heading toward the Gulf of Mexico, where Alabama has a coastline. Trump at the weekend in a tweet had named Alabama as one of the states that could be hit. The National Weather Service denied that in its own tweet 20 minutes later. �Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east,� the National Weather Service in Alabama tweeted.  When reporters later asked Trump whether the chart had been drawn on with a Sharpie pen, the president said: �I don�t know; I don�t know.� Reporting by Kevin Fogarty; writing by Bill Tarrant; Editing by Leslie Adler",https://in.reuters.com/article/storm-dorian-trump/sharpie-gate-trump-shows-apparently-altered-hurricane-map-idINKCN1VQ01E?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2730,Iran lifts all limits on nuclear research and development,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has ordered to lift all limits on nuclear research and development as part of the third step in reducing Iran's commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal. Rouhani announced that from Friday, Iran will begin developing centrifuges to speed up uranium enrichment. Iran's move comes in retaliation to the sanctions imposed on it by the US.",Reuters,"DUBAI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran on Wednesday said it would take another step away from a 2015 nuclear deal by starting to develop centrifuges to speed up its uranium enrichment but it also gave European powers two more months to try to save the multilateral pact. Separately, the United States refused to ease its economic sanctions on Iran, imposed fresh ones designed to choke off the smuggling of Iranian oil and rebuffed, but did not rule out, a French plan to give Tehran a $15 billion credit line. The moves suggested Iran, the United States and the major European powers may be leaving the door open for diplomacy to try resolve a dispute over Iran�s nuclear programme even as they largely stuck to entrenched positions. The friction has intensified since U.S. President Donald Trump last year withdrew from the 2015 international accord under which Iran had agreed to rein in its atomic programme in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Washington has since renewed and intensified its sanctions, slashing Iran�s crude oil sales by more than 80%.  Trump again said he was open to the possibility of meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani but made clear he had no intention of easing sanctions. �That�s not happening,� he said. �That won�t be happening.� In a televised address, Rouhani said Iran from Friday will begin developing centrifuges to speed up the enrichment of uranium, which can produce fuel for power plants or for atomic bombs, as the next step in reducing its nuclear commitments. Under the accord, Iran was allowed to keep restricted quantities of first-generation centrifuges at two nuclear plants. The successful development of more advanced centrifuges would enable it to produce material for a potential nuclear bomb several times faster.  �From Friday, we will witness research and development on different kinds of centrifuges and new centrifuges and also whatever is needed for enriching uranium in an accelerated way,� Rouhani said. �All limitations on our Research and Development will be lifted on Friday.�  Iran says it is only enriching uranium to fuel nuclear power plants, but the United States has long suspected the programme ultimately aims to produce weapons. Since Washington�s withdrawal from the pact Tehran has made two other moves in violation of the deal, although Iran says it still aims to save the agreement. Rouhani had threatened to take further measures by Sept. 5 unless France and the other European signatories of the pact did more to protect Iran from the impact of the U.S. penalties, which have drastically reduced Iran�s foreign oil sales. �It is unlikely that we will reach a result with Europe by today or tomorrow ... Europe will have another two months to fulfil its commitments,� Rouhani said, according to state TV. But Rouhani also said Iran�s new measures will be �peaceful, under surveillance of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and reversible� if European powers keep their promises. A French diplomatic source voiced regret at Iran�s planned  centrifuge development.  �It�s not helpful,� said the source. �We knew it wouldn�t be ... a bed of roses,� he said, adding France would keep looking for a solution despite the cool U.S. reception. Iranian officials, meanwhile, appeared to give a guarded welcome to a French proposal to save the pact by offering Iran about $15 billion in credit lines until the end of the year if Tehran returned to full compliance. The United States was cool to the idea but did not categorically reject it. �We did sanctions today. There will be more sanctions coming. We can�t make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure and we are not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers,� Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, told reporters. Washington on Wednesday blacklisted what it called an �oil for terror� network of firms, ships and people it suspects are  directed by Iran�s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with supplying Syria with oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The United States also issued a new international shipping advisory about IRGC�s use of �deceptive practices� to violate U.S. sanctions and warned those who do business with blacklisted entities that they may suffer U.S. sanctions. Washington also offered a reward of up to $15 million for information that disrupts the IRGC�s financial operations and its elite paramilitary and espionage arm, the Quds Force. The steps intensified the U.S. campaign to eliminate Iran�s oil exports as a way to pressure it to restrict its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for regional proxies. In a possible olive branch to the West, Sweden said Iran had released seven of the 23 crew members of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero that was seized earlier this summer. The IRGC detained the Swedish-owned Stena Impero on July 19 in the Strait of Hormuz waterway for alleged marine violations, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar. That vessel was released in August.

2748,42 crore Facebook accounts including phone numbers found exposed,"Security researcher Sanyam Jain discovered online databases containing around 42 crore Facebook accounts with some users' information including names, gender and phone numbers exposed. The researcher claimed that the databases were found on an unprotected exposed server and also included phone numbers linked to several celebrities. Facebook said that the data set was old and has now been removed.",Engadget,"A security researcher has discovered databases containing more than 419 million records tied to Facebook accounts. It appears the data -- which includes phone numbers and Facebook IDs and in some cases users' names, genders and countries -- was scraped from the platform. However, it's not clear who pulled that information from Facebook or why.The dataset included 133 million records on Facebook users in the US, 18 million on people in the UK and 50 million on users in Vietnam. The researcher, Sanyam Jain, found the databases on an exposed server that wasn't protected with a password. He told TechCrunch he found phone numbers linked to several celebrities.""This dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year to remove people's ability to find others using their phone numbers,"" a Facebook spokesperson told Engadget. ""The dataset has been taken down and we have seen no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised. The underlying issue was addressed as part of a Newsroom post on April 4th 2018 by Facebook's Chief Technology Officer.""The company told Engadget that much of the information in the databases is duplicated. As such, it says the true number of affected accounts is about half that 419 million figure. The company also noted that since the access changes it announced in April last year, it has been trying to reduce the risk of data scraping.Still, while the information in these databases might be from some time ago, people tend to hang onto their numbers for a long time. The leak could put them at risk of spam calls and SIM-swapping scams that could endanger their online accounts -- not just on Facebook.

2749,Twitter suspends SMS tweeting post CEO Dorsey's account hack,"Twitter has temporarily disabled the ability to post tweets on the micro-blogging platform via SMS. This comes days after the feature was misused to hack several accounts reportedly through SIM swap fraud, including those of some celebrities and Twitter Co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey. Hackers had tweeted a bomb threat, racial slurs and vulgar tweets from Dorsey's account.",Engadget,"Twitter isn't taking any chances in the wake of hackers compromising the accounts of celebrities and its own CEO.  The social site is ""temporarily"" disabling the option to tweet via SMS until there's greater security in place.  Carriers need to address ""vulnerabilities"" in their systems, the company said, while Twitter itself planned to tackle its reliance on linked phone numbers for two-factor authentication.  It'll reinstate SMS tweeting in regions that need it for ""reliable communication,"" but it's working on a long-term solution.The company hasn't provided a detailed explanation for what happened, but Jack Dorsey's account fell victim to a ""security oversight"" at his carrier that let people send tweets via text through his phone number.  It's not clear if this is the result of SIM hijacking, a spoofing attempt or something similar.Whatever the cause, it's a drastic step.  SMS-based tweeting has been a core element of Twitter since the very beginning, and it's been available long since the majority of people switched to posting from apps and websites.  Not that Twitter necessarily had much choice.

Several cities, such as New Delhi in India and Cairo in Egypt received substantial downgrades on their scores owing to problems linked to climate change, such as poor air quality, undesirable average temperatures and inadequate water provision,� the report said.The EIU also flagged �an escalation in abuses against journalists in recent years� in India, citing a decline in the country�s ranking in Reporters Without Borders� Press Freedom Index where India now sits in the bottom quartile of countries.The study also pointed out that Asian cities have overall scored slightly below the global average, with three cities, namely Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea which was ranked 135th, Karachi in Pakistan which was ranked 136th, and Dhaka in Bangladesh which was ranked 138th, being among the ten least liveable cities globally.The EIU said its ranking of 140 cities is based on their scores in five broad categories � stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. Each factor in a city is rated as acceptable, tolerable, uncomfortable, undesirable or intolerable.�We expect problems relating to climate change to put increasing pressure on liveability scores in the coming years and for the number of cities affected to grow. In recent years liveability has generally been rising, thanks to improvements in stability and better education and healthcare provision in cities within emerging markets. But these improvements are under serious threat from an increasingly adverse climate,� EIU�s global forecasting director Agathe Demarais said.While New Delhi has been given an overall score of 56.3, Mumbai has got 56.2, while top-ranked Vienna has scored 99.1 and least-ranked Damascus (Syria) has got 30.7 points.A score between 50-60 points, which is the case for India, indicates constrained liveability conditions.With Inputs From PTI",https://www.india.com/news/india/new-delhi-slides-6-spots-down-in-worlds-most-liveable-cities-ranking-3764871/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

It will add Harvard professor Frances Frei after the offering is completed this month. WeWork also unwound a $5.9 million payment to its CEO Adam Neumann for use of ""We"" trademarks.",Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company took some steps on Wednesday to burnish its appeal to investors ahead of its initial public offering by adding a woman, Frances Frei, to its all-male board and announcing that its CEO would return a $5.9 million payment for use of the trademarked word �We.� The moves follow investor criticism of We Company�s IPO filing last month, which revealed extensive and unusual ties between the office space sharing startup and its controlling shareholder, CEO Adam Neumann, including him being a landlord to the company on some properties.� Corporate governance advocates cautioned the We Company�s latest steps may not be enough to quell concerns about Neumann�s grip on the company, cemented by a multi-class share structure designed to give him operational control.   �These are positive steps,� said David Erickson, a senior fellow and finance lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania�s Wharton School. �The challenge is, from my vantage point, you�ve got a CEO who is going to control decision making that has to date not demonstrated the good judgment that I would expect from the CEO of a public company.� Frei, a professor of technology and operations management at Harvard Business School, will join WeWork�s board once it completes the IPO, planned for later this month.  The We Company had originally planned to go public with an all-male seven-member board, a practice major investors such as BlackRock Inc frown uphere saying more diverse boards make better decisions.  The We Company also said in an amended filing it will add another director to its board within a year of the IPO, �with a commitment to increasing the board�s gender and ethnic diversity.�  The deal to pay Neumann for use of the �We� trademark came after the decision to rebrand WeWork as the We Company earlier this year.      WeWork, which rents desks to companies and individuals with a focus on startups and entrepreneurs, has helped popularize the concept of shared office space. It was valued at $47 billion earlier this year.  Despite the company�s breakneck growth, there are investor concerns over a mismatch between its cash flow and liabilities, given that it rents workspace to clients under short-term contracts, but pays rent for them itself under long-term leases. New York-based We Company, founded in 2010, saw its revenue double to $1.54 billion in the first half of this year, though its losses were 25% higher during the period than a year earlier, at $900 million.

2815,"Google, YouTube fined $170 mn for illegally collecting data from kids","The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) today imposed a record $170 million fine on Google and YouTube for illegally collecting personal information from children without their parents' consent. YouTube earned millions of dollars by using 'cookies' to deliver targeted advertisements to viewers, FTC said. The US law requires parental consent prior to collecting personal information from children aged below 13.",Reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc, and its YouTube video service will pay $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday. YouTube had been accused of tracking viewers of children�s channels using cookies without parental consent and using those cookies to target million of dollars in advertisements to those viewers.  The settlement with the FTC and the New York attorney general�s office, which will receive $34 million, is the largest since a law banning collecting information about children under age 13 came into effect in 1998. The law was revised in 2013 to include �cookies,� used to track a person�s internet viewing habits. It is also small compared with the company�s revenues. Alphabet, which generates about 85% of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, in July reported total second-quarter revenue of $38.9 billion. YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that in four months it would begin treating all data collected from people watching children�s content as if it came from a child. �This means that we will limit data collection and use on videos made for kids only to what is needed to support the operation of the service,� YouTube said on its blog. In addition to the monetary fine, the proposed settlement requires the company to create a system for identifying content aimed at children and to notify channel owners about their obligations to get consent from parents before collecting information on children. FTC Chairman Joe Simons noted at a news conference on Wednesday what he said were important changes to YouTube business practices. �No other company in America is subject to these types of requirements and they will impose significant costs on YouTube,� he told reporters. FTC�s Bureau of Consumer Protection director Andrew Smith told reporters that the $170 million settlement was based on revenues from data collected, times a multiplier. �It happens that $170 million is roughly the budget of the Bureau of Consumer Protection for one year,� he added. Once the settlement takes effect, the FTC plans to �conduct a sweep of the YouTube platform to determine whether there remains child-directed content� in which personal information is being collected, Smith said.  The FTC could take actions against individual content creators or channel owners as a result. In late August, YouTube announced it would launch YouTube Kids with separate niches for children depending on their ages and designed to exclude disturbing videos. It has no behavioral advertising. YouTube allows companies to create channels, which include advertisements that create revenue for both the company and YouTube.  In its complaint, the government said that YouTube touted its popularity with children in marketing itself to companies like Mattel and Hasbro. It told Mattel that �YouTube is today�s leader in reaching children age 6-11 against top TV channels,� according to the complaint. New York Attorney General Letitia James said the companies �abused their power.� �Google and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,� said�James. The two Democrats on the FTC, Rebecca Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, dissented from the settlement. Slaughter, who called the violations �widespread and brazen,� said the settlement fails to require YouTube to police channels that provide children�s content but do not designate it as such, thus allowing more lucrative behavioral advertising, which relies on tracking viewers through cookies. Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats active in online privacy matters, criticized the settlement in separate statements. �A financial settlement is no substitute for strict reforms that will stop Google and other tech companies from invading our privacy,� Blumenthal said. �I continue to be alarmed by Big Tech�s policies and practices that invade children�s lives.� Reporting by Diane Bartz; Additional reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Marguerita Choy",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-ftc/googles-youtube-to-pay-170-million-penalty-for-collecting-data-on-kids-idUSKCN1VP1RR?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2816,It was less bitter than I expected: Robert on criticism for Batman casting,"Hollywood actor Robert Pattinson, while speaking about the criticism over the decision to cast him as 'Batman', said, ""To be honest, it was less vitriolic than I was expecting."" ""It's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you,"" he added. Speaking about wearing the Batsuit, Robert further said, ""It does feel quite transformative!""",Pinkvilla,"When news broke out confirming that Robert Pattinson is playing the next Batman, DC fans were divided. While some fans were hopeful that the Twilight star could pull off the DC superhero role, a majority portion of fans were not fully convinced over his casting as the new Cape Crusader. They felt that actor might not fit the bill and flaunt the cape like previous Batman actors Christian Bale and Ben Affleck. This also led to a petition making the rounds urging WB to reconsider.However, the backlash seems to have left minimal impact on Pattinson. The actor, who will soon be seen in Lighthouse, spoke to Variety and said that he had expected a bigger reaction. He felt that the backlash was rather ""less vitriolic."" He also feels good to be playing the underdog for there would be no expectations from him and he could surprise the fans. �To be honest, it was less vitriolic than I was expecting. It�s much more fun when you�re an underdog. There�s no expectation of you,"" he told the international outlet. While he shared his reaction to the backlash, the actor also revealed his first thoughts when he slipped into the iconic Batsuit. The actor confessed he felt he was a ""transformed"" man when he donned the suit. �It�s maybe the craziest thing I�ve ever done in terms of movie stuff,� he said, as he recalled flying down to LA for the final stage of audition. �I put it on. I remember saying to Matt, �It does feel quite transformative!� He was like, �I would hope it does! You�re literally in the Batsuit.� You do feel very powerful immediately. And it�s pretty astonishing, something that is incredibly difficult to get into, so the ritual of getting into it is pretty humiliating. You�ve got five people trying to shove you into something. Once you�ve got it on, it�s like, �Yeah, I feel strong, I feel tough, even though I had to have someone squeezing my butt cheeks into the legs,�� he said.Pattinson got his career changing call five days later. Coincidentally, it was his first day on sets of Christopher Nolan's Tenet. �I was like, �What a coincidence this is happening. It�s absolutely crazy,"" he said.

Over the time being a number of decisions have been over-turned. At times, teams take the DRS out of optimism, but sides have also used it to perfection. Nathan Lyon would be knowing its significance after Australia used up the DRS in the fag end of the Headingley Test to find that they needed it later.However, Virat Kohli and the Indian team wouldn�t complain as the technology helped Jasprit Bumrah become the third Indian bowler with the Test hat-trick at the Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica.

But Kohli went for the review and it was learned that Chase was indeed out.AdvertisementPreviously, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan took Test hat-tricks for India in Kolkata and Karachi respectively.

Gilchrist felt that had the DRS been there back then, he wouldn�t have been out.In the next ball, Harbhajan nipped out Shane Warne to carve his name in history at the iconic venue.

Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping trade association, said Iran had to immediately release the remaining mariners once the seven crew had been freed.    �The ship was in international waters when it was detained and was in full compliance with all navigation and international regulations,� Sanguinetti said. �The Chamber will continue to work with the UK Government to ensure the free passage of ships through the Strait of Hormuz.� Several international merchant vessels have been attacked in the Gulf this year in incidents that have rocked world commodity trading. Washington blames Iran, which denies the accusation. Iran has denounced U.S. efforts to set up a coalition and says countries in the region can protect waterways and work towards signing a non-aggression pact. The seizure of the Adrian Darya 1 Iranian tanker exacerbated tensions between Tehran and the West that have been growing since the United States last year quit an international accord curbing Iran�s nuclear program and reimposed economic sanctions. The Revolutionary Guards said separately on Wednesday that its navy detained seven trawling vessels with 24 foreign crew near the mouth of the Gulf for fishing too close to Iran�s coast and other violations, the ISNA news agency reported. A Guards statement did not give the crews� nationalities, but Iranian media have often carried reports of complaints from local fishermen about Chinese ships active in bottom trawling, which involves dragging a large net across the sea floor.

They are capturing strategic positions in security forces, in the police, in the military, in immigration, in education ministry and therefore the deep state is able to influence.""Nasheed termed radical Islam as the 'biggest challenge' for the Indian Ocean Region.On April 21, an ISIS attack rattled Sri Lanka when multiple blasts ripped through the island nation on the Easter Sunday. The explosions rattled churches and high-end hotels across the country, killing 258 people and injuring over 500.A local Jihadi group and ISIS affiliate -- National Thowheeth Jama'ath -- had claimed the responsibility for the devastating attacks, which had been widely condemned.Dwelling further on the spreading tentacles of ISIS, Nasheed said: ""In the last 40 years, a very radical version of Islam is being propagated in the Maldives and much of South Asia that has created a breeding ground for extremists and jihadi movements. Unfortunately, so many Maldivians went to fight in Syria"".

2830,Cathay Pacific Chairman resigns weeks after CEO steps down,"Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific on Wednesday said its Chairman John Slosar resigned, less than three weeks after increased Chinese regulatory scrutiny led to the departure of its CEO Rupert Hogg. China demanded that Cathay suspend employees involved in anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Slosar will be replaced by Patrick Healy, a 31-year veteran at parent Swire Group.",Reuters,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hong Kong�s Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) shook up its top ranks further as Chairman John Slosar resigned on Wednesday, less than three weeks after mounting Chinese regulatory scrutiny led to the shock departure of its chief executive. The airline has become the biggest corporate casualty of anti-government protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.  Slosar, 63, will be replaced by Patrick Healy, a long-time executive at the airline�s top shareholder and manager Swire Pacific Ltd (0019.HK), Cathay announced. �I think the timing is definitely very surprising,� BOCOM analyst Luya You said of Slosar�s resignation. �It is a very inconvenient time for Cathay.� Cathay shares rose 7.2% on Wednesday as media reports that an extradition bill that triggered months of unrest will be withdrawn drove up the market. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam later announced the withdrawal of the bill. In a filing to the stock exchange, Cathay said Slosar, who has been chairman since 2014, �confirmed that his resignation is due to his retirement and that he is not aware of any disagreement with the Board of the Company.� Slosar�s latest three-year board term had been due to expire in May 2020 unless extended by a shareholder vote, according to regulatory filings, although a spokeswoman said his retirement had been planned �for some time�. His resignation follows the departure of CEO Rupert Hogg last month. Hogg was replaced by Augustus Tang, who had previously headed Swire�s aircraft maintenance company. The exit of Slosar, a former Cathay CEO who has spent 39 years with Swire, and the appointment of Healy will take effect after Cathay�s Nov. 6 board meeting. Cathay said last month forward bookings had declined sharply as a result of the unrest.  When asked about staff participating in protests, Slosar said last month the airline �wouldn�t dream� of telling staff �what to think about something�. Two days later, China�s aviation regulator said crew who engaged in the protests posed a threat to safety and should be suspended from staffing flights to the mainland and over its airspace.  Pilots and cabin crew at the airline have since described a �white terror� of political denunciations, sackings and phone searches by Chinese aviation officials. In a memo to staff after his resignation and which was seen by Reuters, Slosar said recent weeks had brought some of the most �extraordinary and challenging times we have ever experienced�.  He said that for an airline, however, volatility is normal and Cathay had emerged stronger in the past when it faced challenging times. Healy, 53, joined Swire in 1988 and spent 18 years working in mainland China, including four as the head of Swire�s Xiamen aircraft maintenance facility where he worked closely with Cathay�s new CEO Tang. Healy said in a statement that he was confident in the future of Hong Kong despite the current challenges. �Cathay Pacific will remain fully committed to this great city as Asia�s key aviation hub,� he said.

2834,Samsung working on smartphone that folds into a square: Report,"Samsung is reportedly working on a new phone that folds into a square like a ""clamshell"". The phone will reportedly have a 6.7-inch screen that would fold into a ""pocketable square"", like a flip-phone. Samsung is seeking to make it more affordable and thinner than Galaxy Fold. The model reportedly may not launch if Galaxy Fold fails to sell well.",Engadget,"Samsung still hasn't shipped the Galaxy Fold, but it apparently has a follow-up in the pipeline. Bloomberg sources claim the tech firm is developing a phone with a 6.7-inch screen that folds into a square much like a classic clamshell phone. It wouldn't just spark nostalgia for flip phones, either. The company reportedly wants this device to be thinner and more affordable than the $1,980 Fold, and is said to be partnering with designer Thom Brown on a look that would appeal to those interested in ""fashion, status and luxury."" It won't be that inexpensive, then.The apparent leak provided a few extra tidbits about the design. You could expect a Galaxy Note 10-style hole punch selfie camera as well as two cameras that face the rear when the phone is open. The sources believed Samsung is testing Ultra Thin Glass for the inside folding display, although it's unsurprisingly keen to avoid the durability problems that led it to delay the Fold's launch. App support would be easier on this device, at least. The use of a more conventional aspect ratio on the open display would save developers from having to optimize for the Fold's wider 7.3-inch screen.The question is whether or not this clamshell phone sees the light of day. The tipsters warned that its launch might depend on the performance of the Fold after its imminent launch, and success is far from guaranteed. The Fold was already going to face an uphill battle in April between its high price and niche design. It now has to overcome the stigma surrounding its earlier design woes. If a clamshell model reaches your pocket, it might have to do so in spite of the Fold, not because of it.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/03/samsung-clamshell-foldable-phone/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

Iran had earlier threatened to take further steps in breach of the agreement by September 5, unless the European powers took steps to protect Iran from US sanctions. UK, France, Russia and Germany are the European powers that are party to the agreement.",RT,"�Europe has another two-month deadline for negotiations, agreement, and a return to its commitments,� Rouhani warned at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.Tehran has been calling on the EU to provide relief from the sweeping sanctions that were imposed by Washington after the US unilaterally left the 2015 deal, known as the JCPOA. Iranian officials have warned that they will gradually reduce their commitments under the agreement if this does not happen.In early July, Iran activated the �first phase� of this strategy by increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium beyond the 300kg limit imposed by the JCPOA. The �second phase� � enriching uranium beyond 3.67 percent � was effected shortly afterwards.Rouhani didn�t specify what the next step would be, but he hinted that it would play an important part in transforming the nation�s nuclear program.�The third step is of an extremely important nature, and will considerably accelerate the activities of the country�s nuclear energy organization,� he said.Rouhani stressed that the impact of the move �will be extraordinarily huge.�France previously suggested offering Iran $15 billion in credit lines if it returns to complying with the JCPOA in its entirety. The move would help Iran to negate US sanctions, which have targeted its oil trade and financial sector. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi confirmed that the country would revert to the agreement if the EU continues to buy oil from Iran or provides a suitable credit line.Washington insists that sanctions are necessary to pressure Iran into shutting down its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as well as cutting ties with several militant groups in the Middle East. Tehran, however, denies any wrongdoing and says the sanctions are unjustified and illegal under international law.Think your friends would be interested?

The actor seems to have pulled off the role and the film�s official trailer is a�testimony to that.Did he have any doubts about playing a woman on screen, we asked him in an exclusive chat. �Not really. It was a lot of fun, in fact. I found it challenging but exciting at the same time,� said Ayushmann.The actor added, �We have seen that happened in the past, like Kishore Kumar singing in both voices, Pran sahab in black-and-white films, Chachi 420 by Kamal Haasan sir, Aamir Khan sir in Baazi and Rishi Kapoor sir in many films. This is something different. He has made a vocation out of it. He is utilising that talent [of speaking in a woman�s voice], he is earning money.

""At the end of the day, he will have to pay for what he has done. He cannot run away,"" she added.",CricTracker,"Hours after Mohammed Shami had an arrest warrant issued against him, his estranged wife Hasin Jahan has launched another scathing attack at him. Jahan�s latest comments came just hours after Kolkata�s Alipore court issued an arrest warrant against the India pacer as well as his brother Hasid Ahmed following the domestic violence accusations levelled against them by Jahan.The warrant was issued as the brothers did not appear before the court even once after the hearing started. The court has asked the duo to surrender and apply for bail within 15 days. And as the two wait to learn their fate, Jahan is confident of seeing them getting punished. In March last year, Jahan had sensationally accused Shami of having different extra-marital affairs.AdvertisementThe arrest warrant came around six months after the police filed a charge sheet against Shami under Sections 498A (domestic violence) and 354A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code. Jahan had also accused Shami and his family members of domestic violence. The allegations also included rape by Shami�s elder brother, attempt to murder and physical assault. Jahan is now confident that Shami would be punished for the alleged crime he committed.�If Asaram Bapu and Ram Rahim failed to escape the law, who is Shami in front of them?� Hasin Jahan was quoted as saying by�NDTV. �Shami has been getting BCCI support and some big cricketers� support all this while.

This won�t go on for long,� she added.Hasin Jahan further opened up on the problems she was facing to fight the case against the India star. She said her financial condition and the lack of support made her hopeless. But now that the court has given its latest verdict, Jahan is hopeful of getting the judgement in her favour.�I have been fighting for one and half years. I was getting hopeless. I was not financially strong nor did I have any kind of support. I was running from pillar to post but I failed to find a ray of hope and was giving up,� said Jahan.�It was like this case will get brushed under the carpet. But thanks to Allah, truth always wins. All allegations I had levelled on Shami have been proven right. The judicial system is the same for all. I am really happy and thankful for giving me justice and understanding my pain,� she added.",https://www.crictracker.com/if-asaram-bapu-and-ram-rahim-failed-to-escape-the-law-who-is-mohammed-shami-hasin-jahan/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2851,AIR programme director booked for anti-Muslim post on NRC in Assam,"Kerala Police has booked KR Indira, an author and programme director with All India Radio, for a hateful Facebook post regarding the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. Indira wrote that Muslim women give birth to children like pigs. She added, ""Birth control medicine may need to be mixed in tap water to save the earth from you people.""",The News Minute,"Police in Kerala�s Kodungallur have booked KR Indira, an author and programme director with All India Radio, for a hateful post on Facebook regarding the National Register of Citizens (NRC) list in Assam.Known for being openly anti-Muslim, Indira in her latest post said that Muslim women give birth to children as pigs do. �After all they have to conquer the world by increasing their numbers. Birth control medicine may need to mixed in tap water to save the earth from you people,� read her post.Kodungallur police booked Indira on Tuesday under 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc�and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 120 0 of the Kerala Police Act (whoever by means of any communication device or computer resource cheats by personating, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term� which may extend three years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to Rs 1 lakh). 153 A is a non-bailable offence.Kodungallur police told TNM that Indira was booked on a complaint filed by a person named Vipin Das.Meanwhile, Dalit activist Rekha Raj also filed a complaint with the police cyber cell on Monday about Indira�s Facebook post on the NRC in Assam.The AIR programme director has consistently put up posts spewing hate against Muslims and receives plenty of comments outraging against her posts.Indira�s latest post came after she got strongly worded objections and abuses on her earlier post which said that those who were excluded from the NRC list could be accommodated in camps for illegal migrants.�In Kerala some people are worried about where the non-citizens would go. They can be housed at the illegal migrants camps with minimum facilities, without ration card or Aadhar card. They can even be sterilised so they do not give birth to children,� Indira�s previous post on NRC read.""Indira is humiliating Muslim women. With her posts she tries to create communal hatred and division between Hindus and Muslims. This is a serious offense. I am not sure what will be the outcome of the complaint. I have nothing personal against her, but I wanted to make her and those who clap for her realise the seriousness of what they do,� Rekha told TNM.�Kerala is the only place that raises its voice, though limited, against Hindu fascism. There has been a deliberate and concrete attempt to dilute serious issues, and the anti-Muslim tone in this shouldn�t be overlooked, it should be nipped in the bud. We had seen in the Sabarimala issue how precarious it can be. I don�t think the police, who had even booked an activist who urged people to donate�inner-wear�for women living in flood relief camps, would take suo motu action against people like this,� Rekha added.�Our cities are rapidly getting hyper Hindu in nature and the essential character of that is Islamophobia, which could create insecurity among the Muslims. They should be allowed to live without fear, with dignity and pride,� Rekha said.In absurd move, Kerala activist arrested for saying women at relief camp need innerwearRekha pointed out that Indira�s posts are also misogynistic. �They tell women, like the government or men do, how their uterus should work, how many children they should give birth to,� she said.On Tuesday evening, a group of writers, activists and cultural figures came out with a joint statement on the need to check people like Indira. Writers CS Chandrika, S Saradakutty, activists Maya Krishnan and Rekha Raj, among others, have signed the petition.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kerala-police-book-air-producer-hateful-anti-muslim-post-nrc-assam-108339?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2860,Android 10 allows wireless audio streaming on hearing aids,"Google's Android 10 launched on Wednesday allows people to wirelessly stream audio content including music and calls directly on their hearing aids from their smartphones. The feature is currently compatible with Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL alongside specific hearing aids. The feature uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to preserve hearing aids' battery life.",Engadget,"In addition to features like a system-wide dark mode and more granular privacy controls, Android 10 is adding new accessibility features. One of the highlights is designed to help those who wear hearing aids to get the most out of their Android smartphone. Using a new protocol called Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids (ASHA), hard of hearing individuals will be able to use their Pixel smartphone to stream audio, including both music and calls, directly to their hearing aids -- essentially making them function like any other Bluetooth headset. What's more, the streaming is done over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), so both hearing aids and phone can have enough battery power to get through an entire day.At launch, the functionality is compatible with the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL in conjunction with ReSound LiNX Quattro and Beltone Amaze hearing aids, as well as the Cochlear Nucleus 7 sound processor. Google is also open-sourcing the platform, which should hopefully mean a greater number of Android devices and hearing solutions will support the feature in the near future.Over the last year, Google has put significant effort toward making Android more accessible to hard of hearing individuals. In February, the company released an app called Sound Amplifier that essentially transforms an Android smartphone into a hearing aid. This past July, the company expanded the availability of the app to include non-Android 9 Pie devices. The need for these type of apps and feature is clear. According to the World Health Organization, some 466 million people globally suffer from disabling hearing loss, with that number growing by the millions every year.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/03/android-10-transforms-hearing-aids-bluetooth-headsets/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts

2861,New Google iOS update to let users block images on Gmail,Google on Tuesday announced that it had added a new setting to the iOS version of the Gmail app which would allow users to block external images from being displayed automatically. The new setting is meant to counteract the tracking services that embed small invisible images into emails to let a sender know when an email has been opened.,Engadget,"Gmail users can now finally opt out of having images load automatically on the iPhone app. The email client unveiled its latest update to the App Store that includes an option for those who want to stop their messages from being tracked or who don't need to see every single external image sent to their inbox. To activate, simply go to Settings, select your account, go to Images and select ""Ask before displaying external images"". Android users have had this option for a while now.Even if you're old enough to remember when Gmail asked permission before loading external images, you still might not have noticed that they stopped doing this by default back in 2013. Email providers that year started cutting down on displaying attachments to stop the spread of malware. Gmail instead elected to serve images through Google's own proxy servers. From that point forward, all images were shown automatically. Unless you elected to block images by default, that line of blue text that read ""Display images below"" was wiped from Gmail's interface.Disabling automatic images isn't just useful if you want to avoid trackers-- it'll come in handy if you're relying on a slow or unreliable connection. It will also ensure that your email loads faster, uses less data and may even save you battery power. So if you're in need of all those things, make sure you have the latest version of the Gmail app installed and opt-out of displaying external images. A black-and-white, text-heavy future awaits you.",https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/03/you-can-block-images-on-gmail-for-iphone-now/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=inshorts
